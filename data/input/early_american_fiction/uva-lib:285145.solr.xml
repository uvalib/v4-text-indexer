      <field name="fulltext">A NEW AND BEAUTIFUL EDITION OF THE EARLIER WRITINGS OF WASHINGTON IRVING. COMPRISING HIS Sketch-Book, Knickerbocker's History of New York, Bracebridge Hall, Tales of a Traveller, Chronicles of the Conquest of Granada, The Alhambra. With a Splendid Portrait of the Author. In two super royal octavo volumes, or done up in one very large volume, extra cloth. “The public are indebted to Lea &amp; Blanchard for a number of valuable editions of valuable works, within a year or two past, got up in a style reflecting credit on their enterprise, as well as on the state of the mechanic arts in this country. The latest publication that we have seen of this character is, the works of Washington Irving, who, in this country, if not in Europe, stands first on the list of Belles Lettres writers. This edition of his works is worthy of the author. It is in two octavo volumes, containing upwards of five hundred pages each, with double columns, printed in large clear type, on fine white paper, embellished with an elegant engraving of Geoffrey Crayon himself, and handsomely bound. It contains his inimitable History of New York, Sketch Book, Bracebridge Hall, Tales of a Traveller, Conquest of Granada, and The Alhambra. This volume is indeed a treasure. Every American should possess and read the writings of Washington Irving. There is a purity about them; and while they delight the imagination and enlighten the understanding, they strengthen and fortify the moral feelings.” —Boston Mercantile Journal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. 2 CHAPTER I. CAPRICES OF FORTUNE. We have omitted, in the proper place, to record certain events that happened, during the progress of the conflict, in order that nothing should retard the narrative of that event. But, ere it had reached its termination, and while its results were in some measure doubtful, a new party came upon the scene, who deserves our attention and commanded that of the faithful woodman. A cry—a soft but piercing cry—unheard by either of the combatants, first drew the eye of the former to the neighbouring wood from which it issued; and simultaneously, a slender form darted out of the cover, and hurried forward in the direction of the strife. Bannister immediately put himself in readiness to prevent any interference between the parties; and, when he saw the stranger pushing forward, and wielding a glittering weapon in his grasp, as he advanced, he rushed from his own concealment, and threw himself directly in the pathway of the intruder. The stranger recoiled for an instant, while Bannister commanded him to stand. “Back!” said the latter, “back, my lad, 'till it's all over. It won't be long now, I warrant you. They'll soon finish it, but until they've done—” He drew a pistol from his belt which he cocked, presented, and thus closed the sentence. The stranger shrunk back at this sudden and sturdy interruption, but, recovering a moment after, appeared determined to press forward. The second warning of the scout was more imperative than the first. “Stand back, I tell you,” cried the resolute woodman, “or by blazes, I'll send daylight and moonlight both through you with an ounce bullet. I ain't trifling with you, stranger; be sarten, I'm serious when I take pistol in hand. Back, I tell you, 'till the tug's over, and then you may see and be seen. Move another step and I'll flatten you.” “No, no, no!” was the incoherent response,—“let me pass. I will pass!” The sounds which assured the woodman of the determination of the stranger, were so faintly and breathlessly articulated, that, at any other time, Jack Bannister would have only laughed at the obstinate purpose which they declared; but the moment was too precious for his friend, and he was too earnest in securing fair play for all parties, not to regard their tenor rather than their tone. “If you do, I'll shoot you, as sure as a gun!” was his answer. “They will kill him!” murmured the stranger in accents of utter despondency. He struck his head with his palm in a manner of the deepest wo; then, as if seized with a new impulse, waved a dagger in the air and darted upon the woodman. So sudden was the movement and unexpected, that Bannister never thought to shoot, but clubbing his pistol, he dealt the assailant a blow upon the skull, which laid him prostrate. A faint cry escaped the lips of the stranger in falling; and Bannister fancied that his own name formed a part of its burden. He was also surprised when he recollected that the enemy, though rushing on him with a dagger, had yet forborne to use it, although sufficient opportunity had been allowed him to do so, had such been his purpose, in the surprise occasioned by his first onslaught. But the moment was not one favourable to reflection. Clarence had now overcome his enemy, who was prostrate and insensible, and, faint himself, was bending over him in a fruitless effort to stanch the blood which issued from a deep wound on the side. Bannister approached him with the inquiry— “God be thanked, Clarence, that you are uppermost. How is it with him? Is he dead?” “I hope not. He pants. There is motion in his heart.” “I'm sorry for it, Clarence. I ain't sorry that you han't killed him, for I'd rather you shouldn't do it;—but I'm mighty sorry he's not dead. It'll be all the better for him if he is. 'Twould save a neck smooth to the last. But come—there's a great stir at the house. I can hear the voices.” “But we cannot leave him here, Jack. Something must be done for him. Would to God I had never seen him, for I feel most wretched, now that it's all over.” “'Taint a time to feel such feelings. You couldn't help it, Clarence. He would force it upon you. Didn't I hear him myself? But it's no use talking here. We must brush up and be doing. I've given a knock to a chap here that's laid him as quiet as you laid him—a small chap he was,—I might have stopped him, I'm thinking, with a lighter hand; but I hadn't time to think, he jumped so spry upon me.” “Who is he?” demanded Clarence. “I don't know; a friend to Edward Conway, looking after him, I reckon. I'll see all about him directly, when once you're off. But you must trot at once. There's a mighty stir all about the house, and I'm thinking, more than once, that I've hearn a whoo-whoop-halloo, below there in the direction of the flats. 'Twas a mighty suspicious sort of whoop for an owl to make, and I'm dub'ous 'twan't one that had a good schoolmaster. 'Twasn't altogether nateral.” “What are we to do with him?” demanded Clarence as he gazed with an aspect of complete bewilderment, now at the body of his kinsman, and now at the distant mansion. “Do!—I take it, it's just the reasonable time to hearken to the words of Scripture. `Let the dead bury their dead;' and though I can't exactly see how they're to set about it, yet when people's hard pushed as we are, it's very well to put upon Holy Book all such difficult matters as we can't lay straight by our own hands. I'm thinking, we'd best lay him quietly in the vault and leave him.” “But he's not dead, Bannister, and with care might recover.” “More's the pity. It's better for you and me, and himself, too, if he don't recover; and it seems to me very onnatural that you should take pains first to put him to death, and the next moment worry yourself to bring him to life again.” “I took no such pains, Bannister. I would not have struck him, if I could have avoided the necessity, and I strove to avoid making his wounds fatal.” “I'm sorry for that agen. But this ain't no time for palavering. You'll soon have these dragoons of Coffin scouring the grounds of the barony, and Rawdon's too good a soldier not to have his scouts out for three good miles round it. Them trumpets that we hear are talking some such language now; and we must ride pretty soon or we'll be in a swamp, the waters rising, the dug-out gone, and a mighty thick hurricane growing in the west.” “I cannot think of leaving the body thus, Bannister.” “And you risk your own body and soul,—or your own body, which is pretty much the soul of the `Congaree Blues,' if you stop to take care of him,” replied the woodman. “What are we to do?” “Clarence, trust to me. Take your horse—you'll find him in that hollow; and get to the head of the troop before Coffin's hoofs tread upon its tail. I'll be mighty soon after you; but before I start, I'll give 'em a blast of my horn, and a scare from my puppy-dog here”—meaning 2* his pistol—“which 'll be pretty sure to bring a dozen of 'em on my track. When they come here, they'll find the body of Mr. Conway, and this lad that I flattened; and they can do for 'em all that's needful. I'm a hoping that this here person”—pointing to the chief of the Black Riders—“is out of his misery for ever, and won't trouble the surgeont with much feeling of his hurts. As for the other lad, I don't think I could ha' hurt him much with the butt only, though I struck him mighty quick and without axing how much or how little he could stand. Trust to me, Clarence, and go ahead.” Obviously, this was the only course to be pursued in order to reconcile the duties and desires which the partisan entertained. He took not a single farther look at his enemy, whose grim and ghastly features, turned up-wards in the moonlight, presented an aspect far more fearful than any which the simple appearance of death presented; and, with a few words of parting direction to the woodman, he hurried away to the hollow where his horse had been concealed. In a few moments after, the sturdy Bannister rejoiced, as his ear caught the slow movement of his departing hoofs. The bold fellow then, before putting his design in execution, of alarming the British at the mansion and bringing them down upon the spot, true to the business of the scout stole forward in the direction of the dwelling, in order to ascertain what he could, as to the disposition and strength of the force which had come, and was still advancing. A perfect knowledge of the place, its points of retreat and places of shelter, enabled him to reach a station where he saw quite as much as he desired. The cavalry, a small body of men, were evidently drawn up as a guard along the avenue, for the reception of the commander in chief; and while Bannister admired their array, and noted the stealthy caution which marked their movements, he was also enabled to count their numbers with tolerable certainty. “More than they told me,” he muttered to himself, “but a good ambushment will make up the difference, by thinning them a little.” Having satisfied his curiosity, and perceiving that the main body of the British army was at hand, he contented himself with observing, with soldierly admiration, the fine appearance of the troops—a body consisting chiefly of the Irish regiments, then newly arrived from Europe —and the excellent order of their march; and then stole away, as quietly as he approached, to the place where he had left the wounded. Returning with as stealthy a movement as at his departure, he was surprised to discover that the body of the stranger whom he had knocked down was no longer where he had left it. A considerable curiosity filled his bosom to discover who this person was. His conduct had been somewhat singular, and Bannister was almost sure that when he inflicted the blow which had laid him prostrate, the stranger had uttered his own name in falling; and that too, in tones which were neither strange nor those of an enemy. His first impression was that this person had feigned unconsciousness, but had taken advantage of his momentary absence to steal off into the contiguous woods. To seek him there under present circumstances and with so little time as was allowed him, would be an idle attempt; and the woodman, with some disappointment, turned once more to the spot where the outlaw was lying. To his surprise he found a second person with him, whom a nearer glance discovered to be the very person whose absence he had regretted. The stranger was lying upon the body of Edward Morton, and seemingly as lifeless as himself; but he started up when he heard the footsteps of Bannister, made a feeble attempt to rise from the ground, but fell forward with an expression of pain, and once more lay quiescent upon the body of the outlaw. The scout drew nigh and addressed the youth with an accent of excessive kindness, for the milk of a gentle as well as a generous nature, flowing in his heart from the beginning, had not been altogether turned by the cruel necessities of the warfare in which he was engaged. But, though he spoke the kindest words of consolation and encouragement known to his vocabulary, and in the kindest tones, he received no answer. The youth lay in a condition of equal stillness with him whose body he seemed resolved to cover with his own. Bannister readily conceived that he had swooned. He advanced accordingly, stooped down, and turned the face to the moonlight. It was a fair face and very pale, except where two livid streaks were drawn by the now clotted blood, which had escaped from beneath the black fur cap which he wore. This, upon examination, the scout found to be cut by the pistol-blow which he had given; and it was with a shivering sensation of horror, to him very unusual, that, when he pressed lightly with his finger upon the skull below, it felt soft and pulpy. “Lord forgive me!” was the involuntary ejaculation of the woodman,—Lord forgive me, if I have hit the poor lad too hard a blow.” His annoyance increased as he beheld the slight and slender person of the youth. “There was no needcessity to use the pistol, poor fellow. A fist blow would have been enough to have kept him quiet;”—and, muttering thus at intervals, he proceeded to untie the strings which secured the cap to the head of the stranger. These were fastened below the chin; and, in his anxiety and haste, the woodman, whose fingers may readily be supposed to have been better fitted for any less delicate business, contrived to run the slip into a knot, which his hunting knife was employed to separate. The cap was removed, and in pressing the hair back from the wound, he was surprised at its smooth, silk-like fineness, and unusual length. This occasioned his increased surprise, and when, looking more closely, he saw in the fair light of the moon, the high narrow white forehead in connection with the other features of the face, a keen and painful conjecture passed through his mind, and with tremulous haste and a convulsive feeling of apprehension, he tore open the jacket of dismal sable which the unconscious person wore, and the whole mournful truth flashed upon his soul. “God ha' mercy, it is a woman!—it is she,—it is poor Mary. Mary—Mary Clarkson! Open your eyes, Mary, and look up. Don't be scared—it's a friend—it's me, Jack Bannister! Your old friend, your father's friend.—God ha' mercy! She don't see, she don't hear, —she can't speak. If I should ha' hit too hard! If I should ha' hit too hard!” The anxiety of the honest fellow as he addressed the unconscious victim of his own unmeditated blow would be indescribable. He sat down on the sward and took her head into his lap, and clasped her brows, and laid his ear to her heart to feel its beatings, and when, with returning consciousness, she murmured a few incoherent words, his delight was that of one frantic. He now laid her down tenderly, and ran off to a little spring which trickled from the foot of the hill, with the position of which he was well acquainted. A gourd hung upon the slender bough of a tree that spread above the basin. This he hastily scooped full of the water, and ran back to the unfortunate girl. She had somewhat recovered during his absence—sufficiently to know that some one was busy in the work of restoration and kindness. “No, no,” she muttered—“mind not me—go to him —him! Save him before they kill him.” “Him, indeed! No! Let him wait. He can afford to do it, for I reckon it's all over with him. But you, Mary, dear Mary,—tell me, Mary, that you are not much hurt—tell me that you know me—it was I who hurt you; I—your old friend John Bannister, Mary,— but it's a God's truth I didn't know you then. I'd ha' cut off my right arm first, Mary, before it should ever have given pain to you.” “Leave me, if you have mercy,—I didn't want your help;—you can't help me—no! no!—Go to him. He will bleed to death while you are talking.” “Don't tell me to leave you, Mary; and don't trouble yourself about him. He'll have all the help he needs— all he deserves—but you! look up, dear Mary, and tell me if you know me. I am still your friend, Mary—your father's friend.” The mention of her father seemed to increase her sufferings. “No! no!—not that!”—she muttered bitterly; and writhing about with an effort that seemed to exhaust all her remaining strength, she turned her face upon the ground, where she lay insensible. Never was mortal more miserable or more bewildered than our worthy scout. He now suffered from all the feelings, the doubt and indecision which had beset his commander but a little while before. To remain was to risk being made a prisoner, yet to leave the poor victim of his own random blow, in her present condition, was as painful to his own sense of humanity as it was unendurable by that tender feeling which, we have already intimated, possessed his heart in an earlier day for the frail victim of another's perfidy; and which her subsequent dishonour had not wholly obliterated. He gazed with a sort of stupid sorrow upon the motionless form before him, until his big, slow gathering tears fell thick upon her neck, which his arm partially sustained, while his fingers turned over the long silken hair, portions of which were matted with her blood, in a manner which betrayed something of a mental self-abandonment on the part of one of the hardiest scouts in the whole Congaree country. How long he might have lingered in this purposeless manner, had not an interruption from without awakened him to a more resolute, if a less humane course, may not be conjectured. In that moment the resources of the strong man were sensibly diminished. The hopes and loves of his early youth were busy at his heart. Memory was going over her tears and treasures, and wounds which had been scarred by time and trial were all suddenly re-opened. In this musing vein he half forgot the near neighbourhood of his enemies, and the dangers which awaited him in the event of captivity. It was not then the mere prospect of restraint which threatened the rebel if taken prisoner. The sanguinary rage of party had to be pacified with blood; and it is strongly probable that the merciless executions of which the British commanders were so frequently guilty in the south, were sometimes prompted by a desire to conciliate the loyalists of the same region who had personal enmities to gratify, and personal revenges to wreak, which could be satisfied in scarcely any other way. Of these dangers the sturdy woodman was made most unexpectedly conscious by hearing the tones and language of military command immediately behind him. A guard was evidently approaching, sentries were about to be placed, and the sounds which startled him on one side were echoed and strangely answered by a sudden clamour of a most unmilitary character which rose, at nearly the same instant, from the swamps and flats which lay along the river a few hundred yards below. Mary Clarkson could have explained the mystery of the latter noises, were she conscious enough to hear; but such was not the case. Her consciousness was momentary, and when obvious, betrayed itself in expressions which now denoted a wandering intellect. A stern agony filled the heart of the scout as he rose to his feet, lifted her tenderly in his arms, and bore her towards the tomb, before the entrance of which he laid her gently down, in a spot which he knew would make her conspicuous to the eyes of the first person approaching. He had barely disengaged her from his arms, and was still bending over her with a last look, the expression of which, though unseen by any, spoke more effectually the anguish which he felt, than could ever have been conveyed by the rude and simple language of his lips, when he felt a hand upon his shoulder—a quick, firm grasp—followed by the sounds of a voice, which it soon appeared that he knew. “Oh! Ha! Caught at last, Supple Jack;—Supple, the famous! Your limbs will scarcely help you now, You are my prisoner.” “Not so fast, Watson Gray—I know you!” replied the scout as he started to his feet and made an effort to turn; but his enemy had grappled him from behind, had pinioned his arms by a grasp from limbs as full of muscle as his own, and was in fact fairly mounted upon his back. “And feel me too, Jack Bannister, I think. There's no getting loose, my boy, and your only way is to keep quiet. There are twenty Hessians at my back to help me, and as many Irish.” “More than enough, Watson Gray, for a poor Congaree boatman. But you're rather vent'rous, I'm thinking, you are, to begin the attack. You're rather a small build of a man, if my memory sarves me rightly—you ha'nt half of my heft, and can't surely think to manage me.” “I do. If I'm light, you'll find me strong—strong enough to keep your arms fast till my wild Irish come up, and lay you backward.” “Well, that may be, Watson. But my arms ain't my legs, my lad. Keep them, if you can”—and grasping with his hands the arms of his asssilant, with a hold as unyielding as his own, he set off at a smart canter down the hill, in spite of the fierce and awkward struggles of the other to rescue himself from the predicament in which his own overweening confidence had placed himself. “It's but natural that you should kick and worry, at riding a nag that you han't bitted, Watson Gray, but it's of no use; you're fairly mounted, and there's no getting off in a hurry,” was the consoling language of the scout as he ran towards the wood with his captive. “I see that you never hearn of the danger of shaking hands with a black bear. The danger is that you can't let go when you want to. A black bear is so civil an animal, that he never likes to give up a good acquaintance, and he'll hold on, paw for paw, with him, and rubbing noses when he can, though it's the roughest tree in the swamp that stands up between him and his friend. Your arms and shoulders, I reckon, are jist as good and strong as mine. But your body ain't got the weight, and I could carry you all day, on a pinch, and never feel the worse for it. You see how easy we go together!” “D—n you, for a cunning devil,” cried the embarrassed Gray, kicking and floundering furiously, but vainly striving to get loose. “Don't you curse, Watson Gray;—it sort o' makes you feel heavier on my quarters.” “Let me down, Bannister, and you may go free, and go to the devil where you came from.” “Well, you're too good. You'll let me go free—I'm thinking that it's you that's my prisoner, my boy. I'll parole you as soon as I reach my critter.” “I'll shout to the Hessians to shoot you as you run,” vociferated the other. “Will you, then. You don't consider that your back will first feel the bullets. You're a cunning man, Watson Gray. I've always said you were about the best scout I know'd in the whole Congaree country, and it's a long time since we've been dodging about one another. I was a little dub'ous, I confess, that you were a better man than myself. I was: but you made a poor fist of this business—a poor pair of fists, I may say,” concluded the woodman with a chuckle. “So I did—a d—d poor business of it!” groaned the other. “I should have put my knife into your ribs, or had the scouts round you first.” “The knife's a bad business, Watson,” was the reply of the other;—“a good scout that's not onnatural, never uses it when less hurtful things will answer. But it's true you should ha' put your Hessians between me and the woods before you cried out `you're my prisoner!' If ever a man jumps into determination at all, it's jist when he hears some such ugly words, on a sudden, in his ears; and when I felt you, riding so snugly on my back, I know'd I had you, and could ha' sworn it.” A desperate effort to effect his release which Watson Gray made at this time, put a stop to the complacent speech of the other, and made him less indulgent. “I'll cure your kicking, my lad,” said he, as, backing himself against a pine tree, he subjected his involuntary burden to a succession of the hardest thumps which he could inflict upon him by driving his body with all its force against the incorrigible and knotty giant of the forests. The clasping of the captive, which ensued, sufficiently attested the success of this measure; and an attempt which Gray made a moment or two after to get the ear of Supple Jack within his teeth, which was answered by a butt that almost ruined his whole jaw, terminated the fruitless endeavours of the former to free himself from his awkward predicament. Meanwhile, the VOL. II. 3 stir and confusion were increasing behind the fugitives, and it was a wonder to both that they had not been pursued. The sounds, imperfectly heard by the woodman, seemed to be those of actual conflict; but he felt himself secure, and his thoughts reverted, over all, to the poor Mary Clarkson—the victim of the outlaw with whom she had been left, and, perhaps, his own victim. The poor fellow regarded himself with horror when he thought of the cruel blow his hand had inflicted. But he had no time for these reflections; and the necessity of joining his commander, moved him to new vigour in his progress. He had now reached the place where his horse was concealed. His first movement was to pitch his captive over his head, which he did very unexpectedly to the latter. In the next moment, his knee was upon his breast, and with pistol presented to his mouth, he made Watson Gray surrender his weapons. These consisted only of two hunting knives, and an ordinary pocket pistol. He then rifled his pockets of all which they contained, kept his papers, but generously restored his money. “Now, Watson Gray, you're a Congaree man, like myself, and if I've thumped you a little hard as we run, put it down to the needcessity of the case and not because I wanted to hurt you. I'll let you off now, on your parole, that you may go back and help Ned Conway. You've been his helper and adviser a mighty long time, and you've done for him a precious deal of ugly business. He'll need more help now, I'm thinking, than you can give him. There's a poor boy there—too—a young slender chap, that I hit with a'most too heavy a hand, I'm afeard, and if you can do any thing for her—” “Her!” said the other. “Oh, yes—the truth will out—she's a gal though in no gal's clothes. Perhaps you know her. You ought to—you know enough of Ned Conway's wickedness to know that. Take care of that gal, Watson Gray, and if physic can do her good, see that she gets it. I ax it of you as a favour. You're a stout fellow, Watson, and I've long tried to have a turn with you. I'm thinking you're a better scout than I am; but there's no discredit to you to say that you want my heft and timbers. In a close tug I'm your master; but I'm dub'ous you'd work through a swamp better than me. See to that gal, Watson, for the sake of the Congaree country. She's one of our own children, I may say, seeing we're both from the river;—and if there's any cost that you're at, in helping her, either for food or physic, let me know of it, and you shall have pay, if I dig the gold out of some enemy's heart. Good by, now, Watson, and remember that you must never take a bear by the paws till you've first made terms with him about letting go.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. PROGRESS AND SUSPENSE. “Was ever poor devil caught so completely in his own trap before!” was the querulous exclamation of Watson Gray, as with a painful effort he rose from the ground where his adversary had so ungently stretched him out. “Egad, I'm sore all over; though I think there's no bone broken!” He rubbed his arms and thighs while he spoke with an unctuous earnestness which showed that he spoke in all sincerity, though still with some doubt whether his limbs preserved their integrity. “Confound the scamp! I thought I had been sure. His arms fastened—his back turned!—Who'd have thought of such a canter down hill with a strong man over his shoulders! Well, he certainly deserves the name of Supple Jack! He's earned it fairly by this bout if he never had it before. If ever fellow was strong and supple over all the men I ever knew, he's the man. But for those sleepy Hessians, I'd have had him;—and I wonder what can keep them now. The dull, drowsy, beef-eyed Dutchmen—what the d—l are they after—what stir's that?” A buzz of many voices in earnest controversy, in the direction of the vault, arrested the speaker in his soliloquy, and stimulated his apprehensions. “By Jupiter! they're fighting among themselves. What an uproar—they're at loggerheads, surely—the Hessian boobies.” The anxiety of the scout made him half forgetful of his bruises as he turned towards the scene which he had, perforce, described. There seemed sufficient cause to justify his apprehensions. The clamour which first startled him, was followed by oaths, execrations, and finally the clash of arms. He hurried forward to the scene of the uproar, and arrived, not a moment too soon, to prevent bloodshed. It will be necessary that we should retrace our steps for a while in order to trace the causes of the present commotion. It will be remembered that Mary Clarkson left the bivouac of the Black Riders, at the very time, when, going through the bloody ceremonial of pledging themselves to one another for the performance of a new crime, they left her to suppose that they would very shortly follow upon her footsteps. This, to a certain extent, was, indeed, the fact. They followed, but not so soon as she expected; and she reached the miserable man for whom she had sacrificed the life of woman's life, in full time to have forewarned him of their approach and purpose, had this, under the circumstances, been either necessary or possible. We have already seen what those circumstances were; and the cruel insults which followed her unselfish devotion to a creature so little deserving the care of any heart. The chief of the outlaws had already fallen beneath the arm of his kinsman. The Black Riders had still some arrangements to make —some stimulating liquors to quaff, and purposes to fulfil scarcely less stimulating—before they started for the work of treachery and murder. One of these arrangements, was the elevation of Stockton to the chief command, as if Morton were already dead. Ensign Darcy, by a natural transition, and as a becoming reward for his good service, was promoted at the same time to the station which the other had so lately filled. Morton had his friends among the banditti, who simply submitted to proceedings which they could not baffle and openly dared not resist. They, however, held themselves in reserve, with a mental determination to defeat, if possible, the dark purposes of their companions before they could possibly carry them out to completion. But this determination was ineffective for the time, simply because it 3* was individual. They had no opportunity allowed them for deliberation, and being half suspected of lukewarmness, they were not suffered to get together unwatched and unobserved by the dominant faction. Elated with his success, the arrogant Stockton fancied that the path of the future was fairly open before his steps, unembarrassed by all obstructions, and the smiles of good fortune beckoning him to the conquest. There was but one task before him to render all things easy, and that, a malignant sentiment of hate, goaded him on to perform. The murder of Edward Morton—his personal enemy—the man who knew his secret baseness, and who scorned him in consequence—was yet to be executed, and this, when he thought of the past, its bitterness and contumely;—of the future, its doubts and dangers—became a task of grateful personal performance. To this task, when all the ceremonials were over, of his own and confederate's elevation, he accordingly hurried. His men were soon put in readiness, and Darcy, who had traversed the ground more than once before, took charge of the advance. Their plans were simple but sufficient, had the circumstances continued throughout as they were at the beginning. They had meditated to advance upon, and to surround the mansion, in which they supposed their captain to be; then raising the cry of “Sumter,” create an alarm, in the confusion of which Morton was to be put to death. It need not be said that the unexpected approach of a British army—under a forced march, and without any of the usual clamours attending on the progress of a large body of men, utterly baffled all their calculations;—and when, following the path towards the tomb, which Morton had originally taken, Lieutenant Darcy arrived at the spot, he found it almost in complete possession of soldiery, consisting of the very Hessians, some twenty in number, on the assistance of whom Watson Gray had so confidently calculated, when he made the rash attempt on the person of Jack Bannister. The Hessian troops had never before been seen by the Black Riders, and Darcy immediately jumped to the conclusion, that these were partisan troops of Lee's legion, which he knew had, a little time before, been seen in the neighbourhood; and the conjecture was natural, not only that they might be there still, but that Morton might already have become their captive. The incautious movement of these soldiers, suggested to Darcy, who was not without his ambition, the project of capturing the whole of them. They were evidently as careless of danger, as if they had never known what apprehension was; and finding them squatting around some object near the tomb, busy in low discussion, the next most natural conjecture, to one of his marauding habits, was, that they had already rifled the mansion and were now sharing its plunder. The cupidity of the habitual robber rendered his judgment easy of access to any suggestion which favoured the mercenary passions of his heart; and taking that for granted which was merely possible, and waiting for no farther knowledge of the truth, Darcy stole back to Stockton, who was following with the main body; and readily filled his mind with the ideas which predominated in his own. But few questions were asked by the new captain. The information of Darcy seemed to cover all the ground; and they were both instantly ripe for action. “There are not twenty—squat upon the turf—some of their arms lie beside, and some upon the tomb, and the plunder, if one may judge from the interest they take in it, must be rather more than has blessed their eyes for many a day. We can surround them in a jiffy, without striking a blow.” “But Morton!—do you see nothing of him?” demanded Stockton anxiously. “No! But if these fellows found him at this house, they've saved us some trouble. They've done for him already.” “Enough! set on, and lead the way. Manage it, Darcy, to suit yourself; you alone know the path.” “Hark! a trumpet! I have heard that trumpet once before. It must be at the mansion.” “The more need for hurry. These fellows are a squad of Lee's or Sumter's, who have rifled the house before the main body came up. We must be in time to relieve them of their burden before they get help from the strongest. After that, we can push up for the house, and see what can be done with the rest.” “Keep all still then,” said Darcy. “I'll undertake to surround these rascals, and borrow their plunder, without emptying a pistol. Let your horses be fastened here, and we'll go on foot the rest of the journey. Dismount! dismount!—we have but a few hundred yards to go!” Such were the arrangements of the Black Riders; and yielding the management of the affair entirely to Darcy, Stockton followed with his band in silence. With the stealthy progress of the Indian, each individual passed to his appointed station, until the tomb, and all about it, was completely environed with a cordon militaire, from which nothing could escape. A signal whistle warned them to be in readiness, and a second commanded the movement. The operation was fully successful. The Hessians were surrounded before sword could be drawn or yager lifted. Nothing could well exceed the astonishment of the mutual parties, the captors equally with the captive. The Hessians, with an army of two thousand men or more, at hand, to find themselves, on a sudden, in custody of a force not twice their own number; while the amazement of the Black Riders was scarcely less, when they heard the clamours of the people they had made captive, in a language which they could not comprehend, and the harsh sounds of which seemed to them so shocking and unnatural. Their disappointment was something increased also to discover, that instead of the treasure of the house of Middleton, the family plate and ladies' jewels,—the supposed plunder, around which the Hessians had been squatting, was neither more nor less than the body, seemingly dead, of the tender boy who usually attended upon their captain. It was at this moment of confusion on both hands, and before any thing could be understood, or any thing explained, that Watson Gray made his appearance, to the satisfaction of one at least of the parties. “How now, Darcy, what's the matter here? What are you doing with these men? Let them go.” “Let them go, indeed, when we've just taken them. Let them rather go to the gallows.” “Gallows! why, who do you take these fellows for?” “Lee's legion, or a part of it!” “Indeed! Had your courage ever carried you nigh enough to Lee's legion, you'd have found out your mistake. Why, man, what are you thinking of? These are His Majesty's new levies, hired or bought from the Prince of Hesse Cassel, at two and sixpence a head, and d—d extravagant pay too, for such heads as they've got. Let them go—they're Hessians!” A gibberish utterly beyond translation by any present arose in echo from the captured foreigners, in full confirmation of this assurance. By this time Stockton made his appearance, and the face of Watson Gray might have been seen to indicate some surprise when he saw him. Gray knew the relation in which Stockton stood to his captain; and was instantly assured that the latter had never deputed to him the chief command in his absence. The circumstance looked suspicious; but Gray was too old a scout to suffer his suspicions to be seen, until he knew in what condition the game stood. “Ah, Stockton!” he said, indifferently—“is that you? but where's Ben Williams—is he not in command?” “No, I am,” said Stockton—“I am for the present. We came to look after the captain.” “The captain!—why, where did he leave you?” “In the swamp flats, some two miles below.” “And what brings you to look after him? Did he order it?” “No,” said Darcy, taking up the tale with an adroitness of which he knew that Stockton was no master— “no; but we heard trumpets, and as he stayed rather long, we were apprehensive about him. When we came and saw these fellows here, with strange uniforms, we took 'em for Lee's legion, as we heard that Lee was dodging about this neighbourhood.” “And you really have never seen Lee's uniforms, ensign?” “No!—never, we've been operating above, you know; and—” “You have not found the captain then!” “Not yet, and what to do—” “I'll tell you. Look there and you'll find him. The sooner we attend to him the better.” He led the way to the body of Edward Morton as he spoke, stooped down with composure, but interest; and proceeded to examine it for the signs of life which it contained. The wily Darcy followed his example, and his conduct, in turn, suggested to Stockton that which it would be proper for him to pursue. Much time was not given to the examination, and still less in vain regrets and lamentations. The selfishness of man's nature soars triumphant above all other considerations, in a time of war; and life becomes as small a subject of consideration, as any one of its own circumstances. “Some ugly hurts here, I reckon;” said Darcy, “we must get him to the house and to the hands of the surgeon, as soon as possible.” “Does he live?” asked Stockton in a whisper, over Darcy's shoulder. “Ay, he lives!” was the answer made by Gray, in tones which were somewhat sharpened by asperity; “there's life enough to go upon, and, with good care, he'll be able shortly to be in the saddle. If we can stop the blood there's nothing to be afraid of, I'm thinking.” This man boldly took the lead, as a man having his wits about him will be always apt to do, in seasons of sudden peril and great surprise. Even Stockton tacitly submitted to his guidance. “Give way there, my good fellows, and let's see what we're about. Here, one of you,—take that door—there— the door of the vault—from its hinges;—and we'll carry him to the house on that.”—He muttered through his closed teeth at the conclusion,—and his hands were unconsciously pressed upon his hips as he spoke—“He'll have an easier ride than I had of it. My bones will tell of it for a month.” The door of the vault was soon brought forward, and the Black Riders with careful hands raised their captain upon it. Darcy and Stockton both busied themselves in this service. But though performed with great caution, the motion recalled the wounded man to consciousness and pain, and two or three half-stifled moans escaped from his lips. He muttered a few words also, which showed that he still fancied himself engaged in all the struggles of a protracted and doubtful strife. When Gray had seen him fairly placed upon the frame, which was amply large, he thought of the poor girl whom the earnest solicitations of Supple Jack had commended to his care;—and, with a degree of interest and tenderness, which could scarcely have been expected from one habitually so rough, he himself assisted to place the slight form of the victim beside the body of her betrayer. By this time, however, the friendly stupor which had first come to her relief, no longer possessed her faculties. She had recovered her consciousness, but under the burning pressure of fever, which filled her mind with all the fancies of delirium. She raved of a thousand things, incoherently, which perhaps none present could in any way comprehend but the one individual who was engaged in conducting the operations. He, too, harsh as was his nature, callous and insensible—the creature of the cruel man whose profligate passions he served, and who had reduced her to the thing she was,—he, too, did not appear entirely unaffected by the wild agony which her ravings denoted and expressed. He walked beside her, as a dozen of the soldiers carried the litter towards the house, and few were the words, and those only such as seemed to be necessary, which he uttered during the mournful procession. “You had better set your men in handsome order, Stockton. You will meet Lord Rawdon at the house, with all his suite, and a fine show of military. He likes to see handsome dressing and a good front, and he'll look to you for it while the captain's sick.” “A cursed chance, this,” muttered Stockton as he drew aside with Darcy to put in execution the suggestions of the scout. “Who'd have thought it? Rawdon here, and we not know a word about it!” “It's devilish fortunate we did not rush on in the dark. That peep of mine was well thought on! But it makes very little difference, except the loss of the plunder. Morton's pretty well done for. No less than five wounds, upon him—two in the jaw, and three in the body.” “But how came it? Who could have done it?” said Stockton. “That matters less than all! Some friend, I take it,— who knew what we wished most and saved us the trouble of the performance.” “But how strange!—and how stranger than all that we should have been deceived in that boy—that Henry!” “Ay!—but let us hurry on, and show alacrity as well as order! of course, we'll say nothing now about the captaincy! Your still lieutenant only, and if Morton dies—” “He must die!” said the other. “Ay! he must. Rawdon will leave him a surgeon, and we will find a guard; and if he survives the one, there's but little chance of his getting off from the other. Eh! what think you?” “It will do;” was the significant answer of Stockton. They understood each other thoroughly, before they put their men in order. The thoughts of Watson Gray were not less busy, as he pursued his way alone with the wounded persons; nor were they more favourable to the conspirators, than was the determination of these friendly to their captain. He knew, better than any other man, the true history of the latter, and the sort of relation in which he stood to his troop. He was not ignorant, also, of the scorn which Morton felt for Stockton, and the hate, more deadly because secret, with which the other requited it. He could readily conceive, at the same time, that Stockton's interest would lie in the death of his captain; and putting all these things together, in his mind, he determined to keep his eyes open, and watchful of every movement of the parties. “Rawdon will take them with him to Ninety-Six,” he muttered, as he came to this conclusion. “I will persuade him to do so, at least, and the chances are fair that they will get themselves knocked on the head before the siege is over. But whether they do or not, we shall gain time, and if Morton's hurts are curable, we shall know it before they get back, and provide accordingly. But one thing must be cared for. Rawdon must not know Morton in the house of Flora Middleton. That would spoil all. I must speak with him before the body arrives. He must leave the matter to me.” Whatever may have been the tie that attached Watson Gray to the chief of the Black Riders, his course was evidently that of a true and shrewdly thinking friend. He had no sooner determined what was proper for him to do, than he hurried ahead of the procession, and made his appearance in the spacious hall of the mansion, several minutes before it could possibly arrive. His lordship was in the parlour with the ladies, but Gray knew him to be a man of business, with whom business is always a sufficient plea for any interruption. “Say to his lordship that Watson Gray would speak with him in private, on matters of some importance,” he said to an officer in attendance, who knew the estimation in which the scout was held, and at once disappeared to do his bidding.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. 4 CHAPTER III. A CONFERENCE WITH THE ENEMY. Lord Rawdon, in the History of the War in the Southern Colonies, appears to have been one of the sternest leaders of the time; as sanguinary in his temper as Earl Cornwallis, and without any of those impulses of a better temper, which have secured for the latter, from one of the American captains, the doubtfully deserved epithet of the “amiable Cornwallis.” Rawdon left himself open neither to the lurking irony nor the obvious flattery of such an epithet. His discipline was rigid to the last degree; his temper cold and inflexible; and he seems to have regarded the enemies whom he had the fortune to conquer as something, which, like the spoil he won, he might easily dispose of according to the mood which governed him at the moment; and not under the direction of any fixed principles or written laws. His cruelties, open and specious, are on record; but these do not concern us at this moment; and we must admit that the King of England had no representative in all the Revolution who was more constant to his duties or more resolute in their performance. Lord Rawdon had also the merit of being a gentleman; a hard, cold, inflexible soldier,—too free to shed blood, and not politic enough to do so at the right time and in the right place;—obdurate in his purpose and unpliant in his feelings—but still a gentleman: a qualification for his crimes of perhaps very small intrinsic value, but one which he possessed in common with very few, among the many with whom he co-operated during his career in the southern country. Well acquainted with the character of the Middleton family, it had been, as we have already elsewhere intimated, the policy of this commander, as well as of him by whom he had been preceded, to treat the inmates of the Barony with all indulgence. Their popularity with the surrounding country, which it was desirable to conciliate, was a sufficient reason for an indulgence, which, in the reckless career of the invaders, they had not been disposed to extend to many; and the time was fast approaching when, in the declining power of their arms, their desperation led them to withdraw even this degree of favour, in the vain hope to coerce the patriotism which they found it impossible to persuade or seduce. Already had the tone of British superiority been lowered. They could no longer maintain themselves in their strongholds; and, evacuating Camden under the accumulating pressure of the American forces, Rawdon was even now on his way to “Ninety-Six,” to protract the hour of its downfall. This was the last stronghold left them in the interior, and to delay, not to baffle its assailants, in the work of conquest, was now the only hope of the British commander. The political aspects of the time were all unfavourable to British ascendancy; and the temper of his lordship underwent a corresponding change with his changing fortunes. This could be seen by the Middletons, the moment when he announced himself their guest, with the air and manner of one who feels all the changes in his own fortunes, and readily divines the effect of such change upon his reluctant host. He looked, though he did not say:—“I know that you receive me with reluctance—that my presence is hateful to you— nay, that you perceive and exult in my approaching overthrow,—but, I still have the power to compel your respect, and I may yet awaken your fears. You shall receive me, and seem to be glad to do so.” But the suspicious mood of Rawdon became quieted, when, in the gentle and easy deportment of the ladies, he failed to behold the exulting expression of those sentiments which he fancied might fill their bosoms. They were superior to that vulgar sentiment of triumph which shows itself in the ill-disguised grin, or in the reserved and chilling demeanour. A quiet dignity and a gentle grace was apparent in the conduct of both, in receiving the British chief:—and this, in the younger of the two ladies, was mingled with some little tremulousness—the result of her consciousness of what had just before taken place between herself and Clarence Conway—which Rawdon was not unwilling to ascribe to the agitation which his own presence must naturally produce in every youthful mind. This notion pleased his self-complacency, and made the work of soothing more easy to the ladies; but they could still perceive that they had assumed, as enemies, in the recent successes of their countrymen, an increased importance in his eyes, which lessened his smiles, and probably increased their dangers;—and they were soon made to understand this difference in a more direct and decided manner. Tea, at that time the bane of the country, though the blessing of the ladies, was the crowning dish of the evening repast; and this commodity, though employed simply in compliment to the Briton, gave Rawdon an opportunity to say something on the subject of their loyalty, as he sat down the rich bowl of gold-rimmed China, from which, in that day of a luxury far more ostentatious than ours, though of far less general ostentation, the precious beverage was drunk. “I rejoice to see, ladies, that your patriotism—so I think you call this flinging away your king and country —takes counsel of good taste, and does not allow you to fling away your tea-bowls also. It would have been a serious trial of faith to your sex to have given up the Celestial liquor for more than a season.” The old lady answered smartly, with no small portion of that spirit which then distinguished the dames of Carolina. “I cannot accept your compliment to our tastes, my lord, at the expense of our patriotism. You perceive that while your lordship drinks tea, we confine ourselves to such beverage only as our milch cows yield us. Sometimes we regale ourselves on Indian tea, which is made of the Cussenna leaf, but this only when our milk fails us, which is no unfrequent event, since the Black Riders have found their way into our neighbourhood.” “And their presence, madam, is only another evil consequence of your patriotism. But surely the whole burden of this complaint should not fall upon the Black Riders. There have been such `Riders' as follow Lee and Sumter in this neighbourhood lately; of whom report speaks not more favourably; and who probably love milch cattle quite as well as any body else. Nay, my fair young mistress,” addressing himself to Flora, “there is another Rider, black enough in my eyes, but, perhaps, any thing but black in yours. Ha! you can guess who I mean by this description; and I will not name him for your sake, but let me catch him!” and he raised a threatening finger, while a half smile rested upon his lips. Flora could not altogether suppress the blush which found its way to her cheeks, and was as little able to control the irony that rose at the same time to her lips. “Ah, my lord, you are too severe upon our poor sex; but—” She paused, and the colour heightened upon her cheeks. “But what?” he asked, seeing her hesitate. “But what if he catches you, my lord?” “Flora, Flora!” said the grandmother, with a look and voice of warning. A momentary gravity overspread the face of Rawdon, and his severe features, under the dark shade of his lowering brows, almost startled Flora with a sentiment of apprehension for her own imprudence; but the good sense and breeding of his lordship came to her relief as well as his own. “Ah, my fair foe,” he said with a smile of good nature, “still incorrigible—still dangerous. The tongues of your Carolina ladies inflict deeper wounds than the swords of your heroes.” “I would you could think so, my lord.” “Why, they do,” he answered, “they do.” “Nay, my lord, I will not contradict you, and yet I am trying to persuade myself that you will think otherwise before you come back from `Ninety-Six.”' “And do you find the task of self-persuasion difficult? 4* I should think not; at least, you hope I will come back?” “Yes, my lord, I hope so—in safety; but with such opinions as will make you think better of our soldiers, and, in this reason, find a much farther journey necessary.” “What, to Charlestown, eh? a forced march back?” “To England, my lord; to England; at that distance there will be some chance of our being better friends, and we shall then resume our tea.” “But without the duties?” he said laughing. “Not altogether, my lord. I, for one, feel all the disposition to be the dutiful friend—if you please the dutiful child—of England;—but not the subject, not the slave! Her victim, rather!” “Ah, my fair Flora, we wish no sacrifice: none of you, at least. We shall drag no damsel to the altar, unless it be to one of her own choosing. But in revenge for this sharp speech of yours, fair lady, may I know when Colonel Conway was here last; how long since he has taken his departure, and where I may expect to find him?” “He has been here, my lord, I frankly tell you, but when he left I will not say. You will find him—” She hesitated as if in meditation, while her large brilliant eyes shone without a cloud upon her auditor, and her form seemed to dilate in more than feminine majesty as she rose to leave the room:— “Stay, Miss Middleton,” said his lordship, “you have not told me where I may expect to find Colonel Conway.” Her answer was immediate, with flashing eyes, and fearless accents. “You may expect to find him, my lord, wherever an ambush can be laid; whenever a bold soldier may fancy that his sword can make an enemy feel; or a good blow can be struck for the liberties of his country.” “Humph!” exclaimed Rawdon, gravely, though without displeasure, as Flora left the room. “Your granddaughter, Mrs. Middleton, is quite as fierce a rebel as ever.” “She is young, my lord, and very enthusiastic, but though she speaks thus, I'm sure she is quite as unhappy at this war as any of us. We all wish it well over.” “That is saying every thing for the right side. To wish it well over, madam, is simply to wish our king his own again. But now, that your daughter has withdrawn, let me remind you, Mrs. Middleton, of the royal favour to yourself and family—” “To me, my lord;—to my family!” was the reply of the venerable lady, with some appearance of astonishment. “Yes, madam, in the immunity you have so long enjoyed, when it has been well known to his majesty's commanders in the South, that your own and the sentiments of your grand-daughter—your opinions and wishes —are all unfavourable to his authority.” “Am I to understand, my lord, that his majesty's officers are instructed to wage war against the opinions of the women as well as the swords of the men of Carolina?” “No, madam, far from it; but those opinions sharpen those swords—” “I am proud, my lord, to think, and hear you acknowledge that such is the case!” “I had not thought, madam, to have hearkened to this language from your lips. The protection you have enjoyed—your immunities from the confiscation which has usually followed disloyalty, should, I think, have prompted a degree of gratitude for his majesty's government, which would have saved his representative from such an answer.” “You mistake, my lord, in some important particulars. My immunities are not due to his majesty's government. If they are to be spoken of as due anywhere, they must be ascribed to that sense of manliness in the soldiers of both sides in this bloody warfare, all of whom, it seems to me, would have blushed the colour of your scarlet, my lord, at doing hurt to two lone women in the wilderness.” Rawdon did blush with vexation at the retort, as he answered it with a strong effort at gentlemanly composure. “You have surely mistaken me, Mrs. Middleton. My purpose was simply to intimate that his majesty's officers have been at some pains, more than is customary in a country which has been so completely covered with contending armies, to preserve from detriment and hurt your possessions and interests.” “I confess, my lord, the amount of what you now say seems to me to differ little from what was said before. You have forborne to seize my own and my child's property, though we have been bold enough to think that you had no right to seize it; and for this you demand our gratitude. My lord, I understand, though you have not spoken, the real purpose which you feel unwilling to declare. I can very well comprehend the difficulties under which his majesty's arms labour at present. I know that their supplies are everywhere cut off; and that they look to what are called `forced loans' to enable them to prosecute the war.” “You are well informed, I perceive, madam. Am I to understand that the rebel Sumter has been recently your guest?” “Within ten days, my lord, and my opinions being such as they are, I placed in his hands, for the use of my country, the entire plate of the Middleton Barony, and every jewel of value which belonged to myself and child. The few spoons which graced our board to-night, and the bowl in which our children have been baptized from immemorial time, are all that were kept back from the free gift which my feelings made to my friends. These, my lord—” “Of these, madam, the cause of my king does not make it necessary that I should deprive you;” replied Rawdon with a graceful dignity which left nothing to be complained of. “Your plate would have been important to us, Mrs. Middleton; and you will do us the justice to believe, that, knowing as we did its great intrinsic value, we did not make this requisition until the last hour, and then only in obedience to necessities which none but ourselves can comprehend. Believe me, madam, though I am somewhat disappointed, it is a pain spared me, which I would have felt, in depriving you of this family treasure. Nor can I complain, regarding your social attachments with respect, that you have yielded it to the hands of those who will make use of it against me. I must do as well as I can without it. Let me not lose your esteem, my dear madam, because of my proposition, which you will also do me the justice to believe was not less painful than unavoidable.” The meassage of Watson Gray was received at this moment, and the venerable old lady disappeared with a kind courtesy, leaving his lordship free to the interview with the scout. “A brave-hearted old woman!” said his lordship, during the brief interval in which he remained alone. “She has given a monstrous subsidy to Greene, which will keep him on his legs awhile, and perhaps trip ours; and yet I cannot be angry with her. The stock is a good one;—one would almost wish a mother or a daughter of such a noble heart and so fearless a temper. Ah, Gray, I've been looking for you. When did you get over from the Wateree?” “I left there yesterday morning. I rode all night, and had to make more than two turns between the Hills and the Congaree, to get out of the way of Marion's men, who seem to me to be thicker than ever. Your lordship's for Ninety-Six?” “Yes—can you tell me any thing about it? These rascally horse of Lee and Conway have, I fear, cut off all my messengers to Cruger, as they certainly have cut off every thing, in the shape of intelligence, from me.” “It's dreadful hard pressed, your lordship, that's all I know, and that was my knowledge three days ago.” “I fear I shall be too late,” said Rawdon. “But you wished to see me on other business. What is it?” “Does your lordship know that Col. Conway, with all his troop, has been here within the last hour? Your coming scared him from his roost.” “Indeed, so lately!” said his lordship. “Then he cannot even now be far. We must send Major Banks after him:” and his lordship was about to summon a messenger. “If I might venture to counsel your lordship, you will do nothing to-night. It will be only to send your detachment into an ambush. This is what Conway expects, and what he will prepare for.” “But we cannot suffer him to lie or loiter about our encampment, we must brush him off at the risk of a sting.” “No, your lordship, but a double guard and extra videttes will serve all necessary purposes, and, with the dawn, Major Banks can be in motion. Now, however, Conway is in possession of his own ground, all of which he knows, while Major Banks will be moving to danger with a blind across his eyes.” “You are right:—and what has Conway been doing here, and where is his brother,—our desperado of the Congaree?” “Here, also! within a hundred yards of us.” “Ha! How is it I have not seen him, then?” “You will see him shortly, my lord, and in bad condition. The brothers have met, single handed, and they have brought the old grudge to a finish, I'm afraid. There has been a desperate fight between them, and the captain is very much hurt. It is somewhat doubtful if he ever gets over it.” “And the other—the rebel;—has he escaped? goes he scot free?” “That I can't tell. I should think not, however, for, knowing how Ned Morton hates him, and how many good reasons he has for killing him, he would run all risks of his own life to make a finish of the other. His condition makes me think that the other must be hurt; but his hurts cannot be serious, for he certainly got off.” “How heard you this, Gray?” “From that rascally fellow, Bannister, otherwise called Supple Jack—the same who carried off Col. Cruger's black charger from the Forks of Congaree. The colonel offered twenty guineas to take the scout alive, and I thought I had him at one time to-night. But I caught a Tartar. He gave me a strange trot, and such a shaking as I shall feel in all my bones for a month to come.” Here Gray gave a full description of the scene, at which his lordship's muscles relaxed infinitely; and he then proceeded to narrate those other details which led him to the subject of Morton's attendance. On this head it was necessary to exercise some adroitness. It was no part of Gray's policy to let Rawdon see that a provincial scout should presume to suspect the integrity of a royal officer, and he studiously forbore in consequence, declaring those suspicions which he felt of Stockton. “It is important that the connection of Captain Morton with the Black Riders, should not be suspected while he lies here wounded. No guard could possibly save him from the rebels, should they be able to identify his person. Here he is known as Edward Conway, the brother of one who is no small favourite with the ladies of the Barony. This will save him from danger without, and secure him good attendance within. Miss Middleton, herself, will, I think, see to that, if on the score of his connections only. I will provide the guard for Captain Morton, and you can take with you his troop which is under the command of Lieutenant Stockton, a brave man and a good officer. They are pretty strong, and the greatest daredevils under the sun. You'll get good service out of them, and will need them too, my lord, if, as I suspect, you are somewhat short of cavalry.” “You think rightly, Gray; and your plans are good. I will leave a surgeon's assistant with Morton, which is all that I can do; but my own surgeon will see to his hurts before he goes.” “Your lordship will be so good as to remember that Captain Morton is no more than Mr. Conway here.” “Ay, ay,—but what noise is that below?” “The captain's body, I reckon. Will your lordship look at him?” “Is he sensible—conscious?” “I think not yet, my lord. He was in a swoon when I left him, in consequence of loss of blood.” “It will not need then. I will send Mr. Coppinger to examine his hurts, and as I am to know nothing about him, you must take your own course to get him domiciled among the ladies.” “That is easily done, your lordship,” said Gray, retiring, “I have your lordship's permission to make the necessary arrangements.” “You have; send me Lieutenant Farrington, who waits without;” said Rawdon, as the other left the room. It scarcely need be said that the wily Gray succeeded in all his present purposes. His opinions were esteemed to be sufficiently sound by his lordship, to be followed implicitly. Lieutenant Stockton was relieved from the care of his captain, and ordered to place himself, with his whole troop, under the command of Major Banks of the British cavalry, and the bare intimation of Morton's situation, to the ladies of the barony, secured for the wounded man one of the most comfortable chambers in the mansion; nor did Watson Gray neglect the forlorn and outcast damsel whom John Bannister had commended to his care. An adjoining apartment was readily procured for her in the same spacious dwelling, and the surgeon's aid was solicited for the poor victim as soon as it had been bestowed upon her betrayer. We leave Edward Conway in the same house with Flora Middleton—but as yet utterly unconscious of her presence and near neighbourhood;—while we pursue the route taken by his brother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. A MIDNIGHT ATTACK.—A PRISONER. Clarence Conway was not far distant from the British camp, and was soon found by John Bannister, after the latter had taken his leave of Watson Gray. The partisan had already reached his troop, and got it in partial readiness for immediate exercise. His force was little more than that of a captain's command, consisting of some eighty-five men all told; but, on occasion, his regiment might be made complete. Such fluctuations were constant in the American army; and were inevitably consequent to the miserable system then prevalent in regard to militia service. Marion's brigade has been known to range from eight, to eight hundred men—and this difference, in scarcely any case, the result of disaster. The volunteers came and went, according to circumstances of more or less necessity; and, sometimes as it suited their inclinations. There were always good reasons for this seeming laxity of discipline, as well because of the pressure of a far superior foe, as in the exhausted condition of the country of Carolina, where, for a space of nearly two years, few crops of any kind had been planted; and it became next to impossible to find food and forage for any large body of men and horse, for any considerable time together. The service was of a sort, also, to render small bodies of horse far more useful than grand armies; and where food was to be procured, and brought from a great distance, such detachments were of the very last importance. Conway's regiment, according to the necessities of the service, was in half a dozen hands; Sumter VOL. II. 5 had a portion of it at this time, on the Santee; Marion on the Pedee; while Greene exercised the remaining divisions as Conway employed the small body in his immediate command;—in cutting off supplies—intercepting messengers, overawing the disaffected, and hanging upon the skirts of the enemy where they marched, as at this time, in a body too large for any more bold procedure. Bannister found his leader well prepared for movement and anxiously awaiting him. The former told his story in a few words, not entirely omitting the ludicrous passages which had taken place between himself and Gray. As the connection between this latter person and Edward Morton was very well known to Clarence, the mind of the latter was rendered rather easy on the subject of his brother. He knew that Morton was of sufficient importance to the British army to make his restoration the particular charge of Rawdon; but his satisfaction on this subject was somewhat qualified when he remembered that the patient would, necessarily, become an occupant of the same dwelling with Flora Middleton. His anxieties were such as are natural enough to the lover, who, in such cases, will always be apt to fancy and to fear a thousand evil influences. He had no doubts of the firmness and fidelity of Flora, but knowing the connections of Morton, he dreaded lest the latter should find some means to abuse the hospitality which he well knew would be accorded him. These thoughts were troublesome enough to render activity desirable by way of relief; and, after a brief space given to consultation with his favourite scout, and private meditation, he determined to beat up the quarters of Rawdon before morning. It was midnight when Bannister began to bestir himself and his comrades for this purpose. The troop had been suffered to snatch a few hours of brief repose on the edge of a little bay, that stretched itself nearly to the river bank on one hand, and to the main road of the country on the other; in such a position of security and under such good watch that no apprehension could be excited for their safety, a dense thicket covered their front; beyond, and lying between the thicket and the barony, was an open pine wood, the undergrowth being kept down by the destructive practice, still barbarously continued in the south, of firing the woods annually in the opening of the spring. This wood was traversed by the scouts of Conway, who saw the advanced videttes of the British, without suffering themselves to be seen, and gradually receded as the latter continued to approach; still, however, keeping a keen eye upon the stations which they severally assumed. On the present occasion, following the suggestion of Watson Gray, Lord Rawdon had doubled his sentries, and increased the usual number of videttes. His post was well guarded, though nothing could have been more idle than the fear that a force, such as he commanded, could be securely annoyed by any of the roving squads of horse which the Americans had dispersed about the country. But, at this time, the timidity of the British increased hourly in due degree with the increased audacity of the Americans. There was too much at stake to suffer any British commander to omit any of the usual safeguards of an army; and their plans and performances, from this period, show a degree of scrupulous caution, which, at certain periods of strife—and this was one of them in their situation—may, with justice, be considered imbecility. To dash for a moment into the camp of the British, and carry off a group of captives, was one of the ordinary proofs of the novel confidence which the partisans had acquired of their own prowess, during the year in progress. Conway, however, was not the man to do any thing rashly at such a moment. If caution was necessary to the British, prudence was also a high virtue, at this particular juncture, with the Americans. Before he led his men forward, he determined to explore the British camp himself; and having arranged with Bannister for a concerted espionage, the two went forward for this purpose, though on different routes. Conway pursued the way through the pine forest in front, while Bannister took an opposite but parallel course along the high road, which he crossed for this purpose. They were absent about two hours, and, in the mean time, every thing was quiet enough in the camps. At the end of this period they returned in safety; and a mutual report enabled them to determine upon the course which they were to take. They had satisfied themselves of the true position of the British army, and discovered, that, while the sentries were doubled on the path to which it was advancing, they had not conceived it necessary to place more than an ordinary watch on that which they had passed over during the day. By making a small circuit of a mile and a half along a negro footpath which carried them through a swamp on the right, Conway found that he could get into the British rear, and probably use the sabre to advantage on the edge of the encampment. This was to be done with the main body of the troop, while a feint was to be made with the residue along the better guarded British line in front. It was near two o'clock in the morning when the preparations of the partisans were completed; and John Bannister had already gathered together the division which had been assigned him, when he was plucked on the sleeve by a soldier whose person he could not distinguish in the shadows where they stood. This person called him aside for a moment, and Bannister then discovered him to be the father of poor Mary Clarkson. This man was a sullen, dark, solitary, but unsubdued spirit; who said nothing, felt nothing, asked for nothing, complained of nothing, and had but one desire in the world. John Bannister had missed sight of Clarkson till now, and, perhaps, had rather avoided him since his return from the scene in which his unlucky arm inflicted the unintentional injury upon the child of the former. He now shrunk to look upon the miserable old man; and when he spoke to him, it was with a feeling of compunctious sorrow, almost as great as he would have felt had he himself inflicted upon the unhappy father the wrong which was due to Edward Morton only. “You ha'n't spoke to me about going with you, Jack Bannister,” said Clarkson, with some irritation in his tones; “but I'm going with you jest the same.” “No, Jake, you're to keep with Lieutenant Peyton's party, that's to make a feint here in front. He'll call you up, the moment we set off.” “I don't stay with him, Jack;—I must keep with you or the colonel,” said the man doggedly. “But why, Jake, why won't you stay?” “You're going to strike at the camp, ain't you? You'll ride up to the barony, perhaps?” “May be so—there's no telling yet.” “That's why I want to go with you or the colonel.” “Well, now, Jake, I'd much rather you'd stay with the lieutenant.” “It's onpossible,” said Clarkson obstinately. “Look you, Jack Bannister, I don't take it as friendly, that you didn't tell me that Ned Conway was at the barony.” “How do you know?—who told you?” demanded the woodsman in some astonishment. “Never you mind. I know that you saw him there, and what's more I know that the colonel fit with him, and's hurt him mightily. But I know he's not got what's to finish him; and I'll go where there's any chance to do it.” “Lord, Jake, there's no chance. We'll not get nigher to the camp than the outposts, and if we can carry off a few outskarters it's all we look for. Ned Conway is at the house, I reckon, snug in his bed, with more than a thousand men close round him. There's no chance for you to reach him.” “I reckon I can work through all of them, John Bannister, seeing what's my business. I must go with you or the colonel—no mistake.” Bannister knew his man—knew how idle was every thing like expostulation, and though he also well knew that such a determination as Clarkson expressed was only like to ensure his being knocked on the head sooner than any of the rest, yet, as that was only a chance of war among military philosophers, he let him have his way, and quietly enrolled him with the rest. It would have been a study for the painter to have seen the savage old man reload his rifle, pick the touchhole, put in extra priming, and turn the bullet in his jaws, ere he wrapped 5* it in the greasy fold of buckskin of which his patches were made. “Poor old fellow!” muttered Bannister to himself as he beheld these operations, “I'm thinking he says a prayer every time he chooses a bullet; I'm sure he does whenever he's grinding his knife.” It was with some reluctance that Clarkson was persuaded to gird a sabre at his side. The instrument was new to his hand, but he clutched it with sufficient familiarity when Bannister told him it was heavy and sharp enough to cleave a man through from his shoulder to his thigh. All being now in readiness, Conway gave instructions to Lieutenant Peyton to make no movement on the front, until sufficient time had been allowed him for getting into the rear of the encampment; and then to give the alerte with all the clamour he could command. By two and two, he led his troops forward, each man on foot and guiding his steed with rein shortened, until they had passed the narrow open neck of high land on which the public road ran, and which separated the one bay which he had lately occupied from another to which he now bent his steps. A British vidette was stationed not more than a hundred yards from the point of passage, and great indeed were the anxieties of Clarence and of all, until the horses ceased to traverse the highland, and entered upon the mucky unresounding footing of the swamp. But they escaped without notice. The British sentinel was in his drowsiest mood, and suffered the passage to be effected without alarm. The last two files were now entirely beyond his hearing, and Conway, throwing off the difficult constraint, gave orders to his followers to mount and follow him at as swift a pace as possible through the negro trail which they now traversed. Then, a silence as awful as that of the grave descended upon the forest which he had left, and prevailed over the same for a space of nearly two hours more, when Lieutenant Peyton prepared to make the feint, which was to divert the attention of the British camp from the point which was seriously threatened. With twenty men, judiciously scattered along the front so as to present an object of equal alarm to the whole line of the enemy's sentries, he slowly advanced, and having that advantage which arises from a perfect knowledge of his ground, his approach remained unseen and unsuspected until it was almost possible for his pistols to be emptied with some prospect of each bullet being made to tell upon its separate victim. A silence almost equally great prevailed over that vast hive of human hearts, which was then beating within the immediate precincts of the barony. Sleep had possessed the great body of its inmates. Exhaustion had done its worst. The forced marches of Lord Rawdon, stimulated as they had been by the fear of losing the last and strongest outpost of his government, together with its brave and numerous garrisons, had severely tested the strength and the spirit of his troops, and deep was the lethargy of all those to whom the privilege of sleep had been accorded. Nor were those to whom it had been expressly denied, in a condition of much more ability and consciousness. The sentinels, though strictly cautioned, had suffered themselves to be persuaded that there could be no danger, in a region in which they well knew there was no enemy embodied in sufficient force to make itself feared by their own; and if they had not formally yielded themselves up to sleep upon their places of watch, they at least made no serious effort to escape its grateful influences, and were no longer vigilant as they would have been in a time of danger. Through the avenue, and ranged along the grounds of the park which lay beside it, two thousand men in groups, lay upon their arms, in happy slumber, uncovered to the serene sky of May; while, in the silvery glances of the soft moonlight, which glistened brightly from his steel cap and polished bayonet, the drowsy sentinel performed his weary round of watch; or, leaning in half consciousness only, against the massive trunk of some ancient oak, yielded himself, in momentary forgetfulness, to dream of the green island or the heathery highlands of his European home. In the mansion where Lord Rawdon had taken up his abode, the same silence prevailed, but not the same degree of apathy. Busy and sad hearts, and suffering forms, were wakeful in its several chambers. Rawdon himself slept;—but, in the apartment assigned to the chief of the Black Riders, Watson Gray was an anxious watcher. The surgeon had examined and dressed the wounds of the former, upon which he had as yet declined to give an opinion. Conway had lost much blood, and this, Gray very well knew, was rather favourable to his condition. The patient lay, not sleeping, perhaps, but with his eyes closed and his senses seemingly unobservant. An occasional groan escaped him, as if unconsciously. Exhaustion, rather than repose, was signified by his quiescence. In another part of the house lay his suffering victim. Her mind wandered in all the misdirected heat of delirium, the result equally of mental and physical pain. By her side sat Flora Middleton. The sex of the poor victim had been made known to the mistress of the mansion through the medium of the servants, by the timely management of Watson Gray;—but that wily associate of the outlaw chief, had not omitted the opportunity which it afforded him of turning the event to favourable account in behalf of the man he served so faithfully. “It's a poor girl,” he said to the servant to whom his information was entrusted, “that followed Colonel Conway from the Congaree, and when he and his brother fought by the vault, which they did about your young mistress, the poor girl jumped between to save the Colonel, and got her hurts that way. She's only dressed in boy's clothes that she mightn't be known among the troop.” The falsehood found its way to the ears for which it was intended; and the proud heart of Flora Middleton rose in indignation as she heard it. “But the wretched woman is yet a woman, and she's suffering;”—was the humane sentiment with which she silenced the communicative negro. “She is a woman, whatever may be her vices, and I will see to her myself.” And when she beheld her, she could no longer scorn the frail victim of a misplaced affection and a reckless lust. Emaciated and wan, the miserable girl sang and gibbered with all the unconcern of the confirmed maniac; and prated at intervals of the childish follies which are usually the prime sources of pleasure to the child. She spoke of girlish wants and girlish pleasures, and ran on in a manner of inconsiderate merriment, which was of all things the most mournful and heart-sickening to contemplate. But she seemed neither to see nor hear. It was only when the surgeon pressed his hand upon the wounded skull that she lapsed away into utter silence, which was accompanied by a vacant stare upon the operator, so hideous in the death-like imbecility which it expressed as to make Flora shudder and turn away with a sickening horror that took from her all strength to serve or to assist. It was only when the surgeon had finished the operations which he deemed necessary, that she could resume strength to return to the chamber, and the patient then lay in a condition of stupor that secured her effectual silence for the time. Not a word now escaped her lips, but a choking sob occasionally heaved her bosom as if with convulsion, and amply denoted the “perilous stuff” which lay thick and deadly about her heart. Flora Middleton sat beside her, with one female servant in attendance, when all the rest had retired. Her personal presence was not necessary, but she could not sleep on account of the troublesome and humiliating fancies which possessed her, on the subject of the story which she had heard in regard to Clarence Conway. That she should have surrendered her best affections to one who could thus have abused and degraded the warmest, if not the loftiest devotion of her sex, was, indeed, a subject of humiliating consideration to a spirit so proud as hers;—and it was with a feeling of relief that the sudden sharp shot of the assault, and the wild ringing of the midnight trumpet, while it denoted the approach of unexpected conflict, disturbed the train of painful thought into which her mind had unavoidably fallen. The tumult without was as wild and terrible as it had been sudden. A moment of the deepest midnight stillness had been succeeded by one of the fiercest uproar. Excited, rather than alarmed, she hurried from the chamber, and encountered at the head of the stairway the person of Lord Rawdon, who was joined a moment after by Watson Gray. His lordship saw her, and a smile, which was scarcely one of good nature, over-spread his countenance as he remarked: “Your rebel Colonel is busy among us, Miss Middleton:—he is a bold fellow, but will pay for his rashness.” “I told your lordship that you would soon find him, but he is even more easy of access than I thought him,” was the reply of the maiden, who, at the moment, had forgotten every thing that she had ever heard to her lover's disadvantage, and now glowed with all the natural pride of one who joyed in the courage of her countryman. “I trust that he will wait to receive my acknowledgments for his early attentions;” was the answer of his lordship, uttered through his closed teeth, as he hurried down the steps. But the wish of his lordship was not gratified. The alarm was not of long continuance, though, in that brief space of time which it had occupied, it had been sharp in an equal degree, and the surprise of the camp had been made with as much success as its audacity deserved. The sentries had been hewn down at their posts, one patrol entirely cut off, and a party of the assailants, penetrating to the head of the avenue, had cut in pieces a half score of Hessians before they had well started from their slumbers. The whole affair had been the work of a few moments only, and when the British were in condition to meet the invader, there was no enemy to be found. They had dissipated with the flexibility of the atmosphere, in the obscure haze of which they completely vanished from the eyes of the pursuing and vengeance-breathing soldiery. In the lower hall of the mansion, Lord Rawdon received the report of the officers of the night, to whom, it may be supposed, his countenance was in no respect gracious. Naturally stern of temper, the annoyance was calculated to increase its severity, and add to the habitual harshness of his manner. He stood against the chimney-place, as the several officers in command made their appearance, and his keen eyes examined them with frowning expression from beneath the thick bushy brows, which were now contracted into one overhanging roof, which almost concealed them, in turn, from the sight of those whom they surveyed. Sharp, indeed, was the examination which followed, and bitter, though brief, were the various comments which his lordship made on the several events of the evening as they were reported in his hearing. “Majoribanks,” said he, “you were in charge of the camp appointments for the night. You will make your full returns at morning of the officers on duty; and let them report to you the names of the last relief. What is the report you make of the camp now? What is the killed, wounded, and missing?” The portly, noble-looking, and truly noble officer whom he addressed, answered with equal ease and dignity. “The returns are ready for your lordship now;” placing the papers in his hands—“this, your lordship will perceive, is the list of officers and guards on duty; and here is a brief summary of the killed and wounded, which are found. It will need an inspection of the rolls of companies to ascertain the missing, and this cannot be so well done till daylight.” “'Tis well, sir,—you are prompt and ready. I wish your officers of the night had known their duty so well.” And with this speech he bestowed upon the surrounding group a single glance of vexation and reproof. “Humph!” he exclaimed as he read—“Can it be possible! So many slain outright; good fellows too— not apt to sleep upon their posts”—and he enumerated with his voice and finger—“Fergus, Childs, Spohrs, Dilworth, Mooney, Wagner—fourteen slain and as many wounded.” He crumpled the paper in his hands with increased vexation. “By heavens, these beggarly rebels will learn to walk by noonday into our camps, and hew and havoc where they think proper. The British name will be a subject for their mockery, and as for our valour!—for shame, for shame, gentlemen; what will be thought of this proceeding? what report shall I make of this conduct to our king?” He strode, unanswered, to and fro along the unoccupied portion of the hall; the officers under his rebuke, looking, with downcast eyes, that did not once venture to meet his glance. “And what of the enemy, Majoribanks? Have they got off in utter safety? If I mistake not, I heard a full platoon from the grenadiers—” “We have found but one dead body, your lordship.” “Indeed!—one body. They will fight us all night, and every night, on the same terms:” and his lordship laughed outright in very chagrin and bitterness. “And one prisoner;”—continued Majoribanks. “Ah:—one prisoner! Well, you hung him, did you?” “No, your lordship: we did not hang him;” was the cold but respectful answer of Majoribanks. “We knew not that such a proceeding would be either proper or desirable.” Rawdon's eyes gleamed with a savage keenness of glance on the speaker, as he replied— “Ha! you did not, eh? Well, let it be done instantly! I will answer for its propriety. Gray,” he continued, turning to the scout, who stood at the entrance, “see to it. You shall be our provost for the occasion. Find out the nearest tree—not in sight of the dwelling, mark me,—and let the rope be a good one. Let him be hung with due propriety.” Majoribanks turned away to conceal his emotion, while Gray replied— “May it please your lordship, it might be advisable to examine the person before hanging him. He can probably give you some valuable intelligence—something, perhaps, about `Ninety-Six.”' “True, true!—it does please me. Bring him before us. I will examine him myself.” An officer disappeared, and a few moments only had elapsed, when, conducted by a file of soldiers, our old associate John Bannister was placed before the British commander.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. 6 CHAPTER V. A REPRIEVE FROM THE GALLOWS. The sturdy boatman of the Congaree was in no ways daunted when dragged into that imposing presence. On the contrary, his person seemed to have risen in elevation and acquired new erectness, in defiance of the cords which secured his arms, and in spite of an evident halt in his walk, the consequence of some injury which he had probably sustained in the melée which had just taken place. An easy but not offensive smile was upon his countenance as he entered, and though erect and manly, there was nothing insolent or ostentatious in his carriage. He bowed his head respectfully, first to his lordship and then to the surrounding officers, and having advanced almost to the centre of the room, he paused in waiting and without a word. Rawdon surveyed his person with little interest, and was evidently annoyed by the cool deliberateness and conscious dignity of the woodman's bearing. “Who are you, fellow?” he demanded. “My name's John Bannister, your lordship. I'm a sort of scouting serjeant, when I'm in the woods, for Col. Conway's rigiment; but with my hands hitched behind me, jest now, I don't feel as if I was any body.” “Your master—where is he now?” demanded his lordship. “Well, your lordship, if I've rightly larned my chatechism, he's looking down upon us now, and listening to every word that's said.” “See to the doors and windows,” exclaimed Rawdon hastily, as he put his hand upon his sword, while his flashing eyes turned to the windows of the apartment:— “who knows but we may have another visit from this audacious rebel. He has had every encouragement to come again.” A silent chuckle of the scout attested his satisfaction at the mistake into which he had led his captor, in consequence of his peculiar modes of speech and thinking. “What does the fellow mean by this insolence? Speak, sirrah, ere I send you to the halbrid.” “And if your lordship did, I reckon I should speak pretty much as I do now. Your lordship asked me where my master is; and as I know no master but God Almighty, I reckon I answered no more than rightly, when I said he was looking, jest this very moment, in upon our proceedings. By the chatechis' I was always taught that he was pretty much here, there, and every where;—a sort of scout for the whole univarse, that didn't want for any sleep, and never made a false count of the number set out agin him—” “Is the fellow mad?” demanded Rawdon, with impatience, interrupting the woodman, who seemed very well disposed to expatiate longer upon this copious subject; “who knows any thing of this fellow?” “I do, your lordship,” whispered Watson Gray, but in tones that reached the ears of Bannister. “He's the same person that I told you of to-night—he's the famous scout that Col. Cruger offered twenty guineas for, for stealing his horse.” The last words awakened all Bannister's indignation, which he expressed without heeding the presence in which he stood. “Look you, Watson Gray,” said he, “that's not so genteel, all things considerin'; and I'll look to you to answer it some day. The horse was a fair prize, taken from the enemy's quarters at the risk of my neck—” “That risk is not over, scoundrel; and that you may be made justly sensible of it, let the provost take him hence to a tree, at once. We shall save Cruger his twenty guineas.” Here Watson Gray again whispered in the ears of his lordship. “Ah, true,” said the latter: then, addressing Bannister, he asked in accents of unusual mildness, “Are you willing to save your life, my good fellow? Speak quickly, for we have little time to waste, and you have none to spare.” “Well, I reckon, your lordship, as I'm a good fellow, I oughtn't to be afeard either to live or to die; though if the choice is given me, living's my preference at this present. I might have a different choice next week, or even to-morrow, for any thing I know just now.” “Too many words by half, sirrah. Hear me: you can save your life by proving yourself honest for once in it. Speak the truth to all the questions I ask you, and no prevarication.” “I'll try, your lordship,” said the scout quietly, as he turned a huge quid of tobacco in his mouth and voided it behind him on the floor, with a coolness which did not lessen his lordship's indignation. “How many men were with your Colonel in this assault to-night?” “Well, about thirty men, I reckon, which wa'nt more than half his force. T'other half played with the sentinels along the woods above.” “Thirty men! Was ever heard the like. Thirty men to beat up the quarters of a British General, and ride over his whole army.” “There's more, I reckon, your lordship,” said Gray, in a whisper, “Col. Conway sometimes has a whole regiment, and I've seldom known him with less than a hundred.” “Hark ye, fellow, if you are found in a falsehood, that instant I send you to the gallows;” exclaimed Rawdon sternly, addressing the scout. “And if your lordship believes a man that does his talking in a whisper, in preference to him that speaks out, its likely you'll send all your prisoners there. It's no use for me to tell you the truth, when there's a man behind you that's been known on the Congaree ever since I was knee high to a splinter, to be a born liar, to undo all I say. If you believe him you can't believe me, though to speak a truth that there's no denying, I ain't very willing to tell your lordship any thing about the consarns of the troop. I'm dub'ous if that ain't treasonable.” “You are very scrupulous all at once, my fine fellow —but, whether you are believed or not, we shall still hear what you have to say. Does the garrison at `Ninety-Six' hold out?” “I reckon not now. It did yesterday morning, but 'twas mighty hard pushed then, and as we caught all your messengers, and got all your letters to Col. Cruger, I'm thinking he's given in, seeing there was no sort of chance of your lordship's coming.” “Damnation! I sent two messengers since Sunday.” “I reckon your lordship's count ain't altogether right; for I myself caught three. I choked one chap till he emptied his throat of a mighty small scrap of intelligence that he had curled up like a piece of honest pigtail in his jaws; and we physicked another before he surrendered the screw-bullet that he swallowed. The third one gin up his paper like a good fellow, j'ined our troop, and helped us powerful well in the little brush we made in the avenue to-night. He's a big fellow, a Dutchman by birth, that come out of the forks of Edisto. His name's a mighty hard one to spell, and I can't say that I altogether remember it; but he showed us five guineas that your lordship gave him to go to `Ninety-Six,' and I reckon he'd ha' gone, if we hadn't caught him. He fou't powerful well to-night, for I watched him.” John Bannister was evidently not the person from whom much intelligence could be extracted, and every word which he uttered seemed to be peculiarly chosen to mortify his captors. Not that the worthy scout had any such intention, for he well knew the danger to himself of any such proceeding; and, as we have said before, his manner, though loftier than usual, was unobtrusive, and certainly never intended any thing like insolence. His free speech came from his frank nature, which poured forth the honest feelings of his mind without much restraint, and utterly regardless of the situation in which he 6* stood. He was just sufficiently cautious to baffle his examiners on every subject, the truth of which might affect unfavourably the troop and the service in which it was engaged. Rawdon soon discerned the character of the person with whom he had to deal; and provoked beyond patience by the annoying detail the scout had given of the capture of his three messengers, he thus, summarily, cut short the conference. “You are a good scout, John Bannister, and your loss, I have no doubt, will be severely felt by your leader. Provost, take him to the end of the lane, give him three minutes for prayer, and then hang him to the tallest tree in front of the avenue. Let him hang till daylight, that the Irish regiments may see and take warning from the spectacle. It may cure a few of them of the disease of desertion, which is so apt to afflict so many. Go, my good Bannister, my provost will see to your remaining wants. I think your Colonel will feel your loss very much.” “I'm jest now of the same opinion, your lordship,” replied the scout composedly, “but I'm not thinking he's so nigh losing me altogether. I don't think my neck in so much danger yet, because I reckon your lordship won't be so rash—” “Away with him—take him hence, as I bid ye;” was the stern and conclusive command of the British general, to whose haughty mind the sang froid of Bannister was eminently insulting. “I would jest like to let your lordship know before I leave you—” was the beginning of another speech of Bannister, which the angry gesture of Rawdon did not suffer him to finish. The provost and his attendants seized on the prisoner in obedience to the lifted finger of his lordship, and they were about to hurry him, still speaking, from the apartment, when they were stopped at the door by the sudden entrance of Flora Middleton. “Stay!” she exclaimed, addressing the officer, “stay, till I have spoken with his lordship.” Rawdon started back at beholding her, and could not refrain from expressing his surprise at her presence. “At this time of the night, Miss Middleton, and here!” “Very improper conduct, your lordship would intimate, for a young lady; but the circumstances must excuse the proceeding. I come to you, sir, in behalf of this poor man, who is your prisoner, and whom I understand you are about to execute, in violation of the laws of humanity, and as I believe, the laws of war.” His lordship was evidently annoyed. “You have chosen a very unnecessary labour, Miss Middleton, and pardon me if I think a very unbecoming one.” “Nay, pardon me, my lord, but I cannot think that my interposition to save life, and to prevent murder, can properly be called an unbecoming one.” “Murder!” muttered his lordship through his closed teeth, while, as if to prevent his frowns from addressing themselves to the fair intruder, he was compelled to avert his face. “Yes, my lord, murder; for I know this man to be as worthy and honest a citizen as ever lived on the Congaree. He has always been my friend and the friend of the family. He has never avowed his loyalty to the king— never taken protection—but, from the first, has been in arms either under Pickens or Sumter, in opposition to his majesty. The fate of war throws him into your hands—” “And he must abide it, lady. He has been such a consistent rebel, according to your own showing, that he well deserves his fate. Provost, do your duty!” “My lord, my lord, can it be that you will not grant my prayer—that you will not spare him?” “It would give me pleasure to grant any application to one so fair and friendly, but—” “Oh, deal not in this vain language at such a time, my lord. Do not this great wrong! Let not your military pride seduce you into an inhumanity which you will remember in after days with dread and sorrow. Already they charge you with blood wantonly shed at Camden— too much blood—the blood of the old and young—of the gray-headed man and the beardless boy, alike—but, I believe it not, my lord;—no! no!—turn not away from me in anger—I believe it not—I would not wish to believe it.” “Too much, too much!” murmured Majoribanks, as he regarded the fair speaker, and saw the dark spot turn to crimson on the brow of the stern and savage captain. He well perceived, whatever might have been his hopes of her pleading before, that her last allusion to the Camden massacres had spoiled the effect of all. “Your entreaty is in vain, Miss Middleton. The man is doomed. He shall be an example to warn others against shooting down sentinels at midnight.” “No! no! Be not inflexible—spare him; on my knees, I implore you, my lord. I have known him long, and always worthily;—he is my friend and a noble-hearted creature. Send not such to the gallows—send the ruffian, the murderer, the spy—but not a worthy man like this.” “Rise, Miss Middleton,—I should be sorry to see you kneel, without succeeding in your prayers, either to God or mortal.” “You grant it then!” she exclaimed eagerly, as he raised her from the floor. “Impossible! The man must die.” She recoiled from his hands, regarded him with a silent but searching expression of eye, then turned to the spot where John Bannister stood. The worthy scout no longer remained unmoved. Her interposition had softened the poor fellow, whom the threatening danger from his foes had only strengthened and made inflexible and firm. He now met her glance of bitterness and grief, while a smile mingled sweetly upon his face with the big tear which was swelling in his eye. “God bless you, my dear Miss Flora,—you're an angel, if ever there was one on such a place as airth; and I'm jest now thankful to God for putting me in this fix, if it's only that I might know how airnestly and sweetly he could send his angel to plead in favour of a rough old Congaree boatman like me. But don't you be scared, for they can't do me any hurt after all; and if his lordship had only listened to me a leetle while longer at first, he'd ha' been able to have said the handsome thing, and consented to all you axed him. Look here, my lord, 'twont do to hang me, unless you'd like to lose a better man in the bargain.” A look of inquiry was all that his lordship deigned the speaker, who, turning to the provost, begged him to take his grasp from his shoulder. “I can't run, you see, if I wanted to, and somehow I never could talk to my own liking, when I had the feel of an enemy's hand upon me.” “Speak up, fellow,” said Majoribanks, who saw the increasing vexation of Rawdon, “and tell his lordship what you mean.” “Well, the long and short of the matter's this, your lordship. If you look at your roll, I reckon you'll find a handsome young captain, or mou't-be a major, among your missing. I made him a prisoner myself, at the head of the avenue, on the very first charge to-night, and I know they've got him safe among my people; and his neck must be a sort of make-weight agin mine. I ain't of much count any how, but the `Congaree Blues' has a sort of liking for me, and they can find any quantity of rope and tree when there's a need for it. If you hang me, they'll hang him, and your lordship can tell best whether he's worth looking after or not. It's a thing for calculation only.” “Is this the case? Is there any officer missing?” demanded Rawdon, with a tone of suppressed but bitter feeling. “Two, your lordship,” replied the lieutenant of the night—“Major Penfield and Captain Withers.” “They should hang! They deserve it!” exclaimed Rawdon; but an audible murmur from the bottom of the hall, warned him of the danger of trying experiments upon the temper of troops who had just effected a painful forced march, and had before them a continuation of the same, and even sterner duties. “Take the prisoner away, and let him be well guarded,” said his lordship. Flora Middleton, relieved by this order, gave but a single glance of satisfaction to the woodman, as she glided out of the apartment. With the dawn of day, the British army was under arms, and preparing to depart. Flora Middleton, who had enjoyed no rest during the night, and had felt no desire for it, under the numerous anxieties and painful feelings which filled her heart, took her station in the balcony, where she could witness all their movements; and no more imposing array had ever gratified her eyes. Lord Rawdon was then in command of the very êlite of the British army. The hardy and well-tried provincial loyalists formed the nucleus of the efficient force of near three thousand men, which he commanded; and these, many of them, well mounted, and employed as dragoons and riflemen at pleasure, were, in reality, the chief reliance of his government. The Hessians had been well thinned by the harassing warfare of two seasons; and were neither numerous nor daring; but nothing could exceed the splendid appearance of the principal force which he brought with him from Charlestown, consisting of three full regiments, fresh from Ireland, with all the glow of European health upon their cheeks, full-framed, strong and active; martial in their carriage, bold in action, and quite as full of vivacity as courage. Flora Middleton beheld them as they marched forward beneath her eyes, with mingling sentiments of pity and admiration. Poor fellows! They were destined to be terribly thinned and humbled by the sabre of the cavalry, the deadly aim of the rifle, and that more crushing enemy of all, the pestilential malaria of the southern swamps. How many of that glowing and numerous cavalcade were destined to leave their bones along the banks of the Wateree and Santee, in their long and arduous marchings and counter-marchings, and in the painful and perilous flight which followed to the Eutaws, and from the Eutaws to Charlestown. On this flight, scarce two months after, fifty of these brave fellows dropped down, dead, in the ranks, in a single day; the victims of fatigue, heat, and a climate which mocked equally their muscle, their courage, and vivacity; and which not even the natives at that season could withstand. The brave and generous Majoribanks himself—the most honourable and valiant of enemies— little did Flora Middleton fancy, as he passed his sword-point to the earth in courteous salute, and smiled his farewell, while marching at the head of his battalion beneath the balcony, that he too was one of those who should find his grave along the highways of Carolina, immediately after the ablest of his achievements at Eutaw, where to him, in particular, is due the rescue of the British Lion from the claws of the now triumphant Eagle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. “NINETY-SIX.”—A FLIGHT BY NIGHT. Clarence Conway, with a single exception, had every reason to be satisfied with the result of his expedition. He had lost but one man, slain; and but two were missing. One of these, as we have seen, was John Bannister; the other was the unhappy father of the wretched Mary Clarkson. The reader is already apprised of the situation of the former; of the latter neither party had any present knowledge: Conway was utterly ignorant, and very anxious about the fate of his trusty agent. The loss of John Bannister could not be compensated to him by any successes whether as a soldier or a man. He was incomparable as a scout; almost as much so in personal conflict; superior in judgment in most matters relating to partisan warfare; but, over all, he was the friend, the ever faithful, the fond;— having an affection for his leader like that of Jonathan of old, surpassing the love of woman. Clarence Conway did full justice to this affection. He loitered and lingered long that night while leaving the field of conflict, in the hope to see the trusty fellow reappear; and slow indeed were his parting footsteps when, at the dawn of day, he set his little band in motion for the Saluda. This measure was now become one of inevitable necessity. He had done all that could be required of him, and much more than had been expected. It was not supposed that with a force so small as his he could possibly occasion any interruption or delay in the progress of an army such as that led by Rawdon, and he had most effectually performed those duties along the Congaree which had been done by Sumter and Marion on the waters of the Santee below. Every messenger between Rawdon and Ninety-Six had been cut off, and, while the urgent entreaties of Cruger, having command of the latter garrison, had failed in most cases to reach the ears of Rawdon, the despatches of the latter promising assistance, and urging the former to hold out, had been invariably intercepted. Nor were the performances of the gallant young partisan limited to these small duties only. He had, in concert with Colonel Butler, a famous name among the whigs of Ninety-Six, given a terrible chastisement to the sanguinary tory, Cunningham, in which the troop of the latter was utterly annihilated, and their leader owed his escape only to the fleetness of an inimitable steed. But these events belong not to our story. With a sad heart, but no diminution of enterprise or spirit, Colonel Conway took up the line of march for the Saluda, with the purpose of joining General Greene before Ninety-Six; or, in the event of that place being already in possession of the Americans, of extending his march towards the mountains, where General Pickens was about to operate against the Cherokee Indians. But though compelled to this course by the pressure of the British army in his rear, his progress was not a flight. His little band was so compact, and so well acquainted with the face of the country, that he could move at leisure in front of the enemy, and avail himself of every opportunity for cutting off stragglers, defeating the operations of foraging parties, and baffling every purpose or movement of the British, which was not covered by a detachment superior to his own. Such was his purpose, and such, to a certain extent, were his performances. But Conway was soon made sensible of the inefficiency of his force to contend even with the inferior cavalry of the enemy. These were only inferior in quality. In point of numbers they were vastly superior to the Americans. The measures which Rawdon had taken to mount the loyalists in his army, had, to the great surprise of the Americans, given him a superiority in this VOL. II. 7 particular, which was equally injurious to their hopes and unexpected by their apprehensions. The march of the British, though urged forward with due diligence by their stern commander, was, at the same time, distinguished by such a degree of caution as effectually to discourage Conway in his attempts upon it. The onslaught of the previous night justified the prudence of this wary general. The audacity of the Americans was, at this period, everywhere felt and acknowledged, and by none more readily than Rawdon. His advance guard was sent forward in treble force—his provincial riflemen skirted the woods on the roadside, while his main army defiled between, and his cavalry scoured the neighbouring thickets wherever it was possible for them to hide a foe. Conway was compelled to console himself with the profitless compliment which this vigilance paid to his spirit and address; and after hovering for the best part of a day's march around the path of the advancing enemy, without an opportunity to inflict a blow, he reluctantly pressed forward with increased speed for Ninety-Six to prepare General Greene for the coming of the new enemy. Our course is thither also. The post of Ninety-Six was situated on the crown of a gentle but commanding eminence, and included within its limits the village of the same name. This name was that of the county, or district, of which it was the county-town. Its derivation is doubtful; but most probably it came from its being ninety-six miles from Prima George, at the period of its erection the frontier post of the colony. Its history is one of great local interest. Originally a mere stockade for the defence of the settlers against Indian incursion, it at length became the scene of the first conflicts in the southern country, and perhaps in the revolutionary war. It was here that, early in 1775, the fierce domestic strife first began between the whigs and tories of this region;—a region beautiful and rich by nature and made valuable by art, which, before the war was ended, was turned into something worse than a howling wilderness. The old stockade remained at the beginning of the revolution, and when the British overran the state, they garrisoned the place, and it became one of the most valuable of that cordon of posts which they established around and within it. Its protection and security was of the last importance to their interests. It enabled them to maintain a communication with the Cherokees and other Indians; and to keep in check the whig settlements on the west of it, while it protected those of the loyalists, north, south, and east. The most advanced post which they occupied, its position served to strengthen the influence of Camden and Augusta, and assisted them to overawe the population of Georgia and North Carolina. It was also for a long period the chief depôt of recruits; and drew, but too successfully, the disaffected youth of the neighbourhood into the royal embrace. The defences of this place had been greatly strengthened on the advance of the American army. Colonel Cruger, an American loyalist, who was entrusted with the command, was an officer of energy and talents; and proved himself equally adequate and faithful to the trust which was reposed in him. Calling in the aid of the neighbouring slaves, he soon completed a ditch around his stockade, throwing the earth, parapet height upon it, and securing it within by culverts and traverses to facilitate the communication in safety between his various points of defence. His ditch was farther secured by an abattis, and, at convenient distances, within the stockade, he erected strong block-houses of logs. But the central and most important point in his position, lay in a work of considerable strength—which the curious in antiquarian research and history may see to this day in a state of comparative perfectness—called the “Star Battery.” It stood on the southeast of the village which it effectually commanded, was in shape of a star, having sixteen salient and returning angles, and communicated by lines with the stockade. In this were served three pieces of artillery, which, for more ready transition to any point of danger, were worked on wheel carriages. On the north side of the village arises a copious fountain, of several eyes, which flows through a valley. From this rivulet the garrison obtained its supplies of water. The county prison, lying contiguous to this valley and commanding it, was also fortified, as was another stockade fort, lying on the opposite side of the valley, of considerable strength, and having within it a couple of block-houses, which assisted in covering the communication with the spring. A covert way led from the town to the rivulet; and the whole, including the village, was enclosed by lines of considerable extent and height. To defend his position, Cruger had a select force of six hundred men, many of them riflemen of the first quality, and not a few of them fighting, as they well knew, with halters about their necks. Greene commenced the siege under very inauspicious circumstances, and with a force very inadequate to his object. This siege formed one of the most animated and critical occurrences during the southern war, and had already lasted near a month, when Colonel Conway joined his little troop to the force of the commander-in-chief. The available army of Greene scarcely exceeded that of Cruger. He had no battering cannon; and there was no mode of succeeding against this “Star” redoubt, which was the chief point of defence, but in getting over or under it. Both modes were resolved upon. Regular approaches were made, and on the completion of the first parallel a mine was begun under cover of a battery erected on the enemy's right. This work was prosecuted day and night. No interval was permitted—one party laboured, while a second slept, and a third guarded both. The sallies of the besieged were constant and desperate; not a night passed without the loss of life on both sides; but the works of the Americans steadily advanced. The second parallel was at length completed, the enemy summoned to surrender, and a defiance returned to the demand. The third parallel was begun, and its completion greatly facilitated by the invention of a temporary structure of logs, which, from the inventor's name, were called the “Mayham towers.” These were, in fact, nothing more than block-houses, constructed of heavy timbers, raised to a height superior to that of the beleagured fort and filled with riflemen. These sharp-shooters succeeded, in a little time, in driving the artillerists of the garrison from their guns. Hot shot were tried to destroy the towers, but the greenness of the wood, in June, rendered the effort unavailing. The artillery of the “Star” could no longer be used by daylight, and by night it was little to be dreaded. The garrison was now greatly straitened. Their provisions were fast failing them; they could no longer venture for water to the rivulet. Women were employed for this purpose by daylight, and men in women's clothing; and by night they received their supplies with the help of naked negroes. Other means were found for conveyance. Burning arrows were shot into the fort, but Cruger promptly threw off the roofs of his houses. An attempt was made to destroy the abattis by fire, but drew down death on every one of the daring fellows who attempted it Beside the “Mayham towers,” one of which was within thirty yards of the enemy's ditch, the besiegers had erected several batteries for cannon. One of these, twenty feet in height, and within one hundred and forty yards of the “Star,” so completely commanded it, that it became necessary to give its parapet an increased elevation. Bags of sand were employed for this purpose. Through these, apertures were left for the use of small-arms; and the removal of the sand-bags by night, gave room for the use of the artillery. Bloody and deadly was the strife that ensued for ten days, between the combatants. During this period not a man could show himself on either side without receiving a shot. As the conflict approached its termination it seemed to acquire increased rancour, and an equal desperation, under different motives, appeared to govern both parties. This could not be sustained long, and the fall of the garrison was at hand. Cruger still held out in the hope of succour, for which he had long implored his commander. He had sufficient means, apart from the natural courage which the good soldier may possess, for making him defend his post to the very last extremity. There were those within its walls to whom no indulgence would have been extended by its captors—men whose odious 7* crimes and bloody deeds had long since forfeited the security even of those laws which are allowed to temper with mercy the brutalities of battle. But their apprehensions, and the resolution of Cruger, could not long supply the deficiencies under which the besieged were suffering. But two days more were allotted them for the retention of a post which they had so gallantly defended. But these two days were of the last importance for good or evil to the two parties. In these two days the American commander was apprised of the circumstances which rendered it necessary that the place should be carried by assault or the siege raised. The arrival of Conway announced the approach of Rawdon, and the same night furnished the same important intelligence to Cruger. But for this intelligence that very night must have witnessed the surrender of the post. The circumspection and close watch which had been maintained so long and so well by the American general and his able subordinates, and which had kept the garrison in utter ignorance of the march of Rawdon from Charlestown, was defeated at the last and most important moment from a quarter which had excited no suspicions. The circumstance has in it no small portion of romance. A young lady, said to be beautiful, and certainly bold— the daughter of one tried patriot and the sister of another —had formed in secret a matrimonial connexion with a British officer, who was one of the besieged. Her residence was in the neighbourhood, and she was countenanced in visiting the camp with a flag, on some pretence of little moment. She was received with civility and dined at the general's table. Permitted the freedom of the encampment, she was probably distinguished by her lover from the redoubt, and contrived to convey by signs the desire which she entertained to make some communication to the besieged. The ardour of the lover and the soldier united to infuse a degree of audacity into his bosom, which prompted him to an act of daring equally bold and successful. He acknowledged her signal, darted from the redoubt, received her verbal communication, and returned in safety amidst a shower of bullets from the baffled and astonished sentinels. Such is the story told by tradition. It differs little from that which history relates, and in no substantial particular; what is obscure in the tale, but increases what is romantic. The feu de joie of the besieged and their loud huzzas apprised the American general of their new hopes; and too plainly assured him that his labour was taken in vain. Colonel Conway was admitted that night to the tent of the general, where a council of war was to be held as to the course now to be pursued. Greene necessarily presided. Unmoved by disappointment, unembarrassed by the probable defeat of his hopes and purposes, this cheerful and brave soldier looked around him with a smile of good humour upon his military family while he solicited their several opinions. His fine manly face, bronzed by the fierce glances of the southern sun, and heightened by an eye of equal spirit and benevolence, wore none of that dark disquietude and sullen ferocity, the sure token of vindictive and bad feelings, which scowled in the whole visage of his able opponent, Rawdon. A slight obliquity of vision, the result of small-pox in his youth, did not impair the sweetness of his glance, though it was sufficiently obvious in the eye which it affected. Conway had seen him more than once before, but never to so much advantage as now, when a defeat so serious as that which threatened his hopes, had rendered necessary the measure of consultation then in hand. He looked for the signs of peevishness and vexation but he saw none. Something of anxiety may have clouded the brow of the commander, but such an expression only serves to ennoble the countenance of the man whose pursuits are elevated and whose performances are worthy. Anxiety makes the human countenance only the more thoroughly and sacredly human. It is the sign of care, and thought, and labour, and hope—of all the moral attributes which betoken the mind at work, and most usually at its legitimate employments. On the right hand of Greene sat one who divided between himself and the commander-in-chief the attention of the ardent young partisan. This was the celebrated Kosciuzko. He had served throughout the siege as chief engineer, and, under his guidance, the several approaches had been made. His tall, erect, military form, pale, thin and melancholy features, light brown hair, already thinned above his lofty brow, together with the soft blue eye which lightened them up at moments with almost girlish animation, seemed to the mind of Conway inexpressibly touching. The fate and name of Kosciuzko seemed so intimately connected with that of his country, that the eye of the spectator beheld the miseries of Poland in the sad features of its melancholy exile. His words, few, and sweetened as it were by the imperfect English in which they were expressed, riveted the attention of all, and were considered with marked deference by the commander, to whom they were addressed. There were other brave men at that anxious table, but Conway had eyes and ears for none but these. There was Lee of the legion, whom Greene emphatically styled the eye and wing of his army; Campbell of the Virginians, who subsequently fell at the Eutaw, while bravely leading on his command; Kirkwood of the Delawares, happily designated as the continental Diomed, a soldier of delightful daring; Howard of the Marylanders; Rudolph of the legion, Armstrong, and Benson, and others; whose presence would enlighten any council-board, as their valour had done honour to every field in which they fought; but the centre of attraction lay between the two great men —emphatically great either in their achievements, or in the proud relation which they bore to the human family for which they suffered. The name of Kosciuzko belongs to two hemispheres, and though his position may have been subordinate in one, his name is honourably identified with the history of both. The consultation was brief. The points to be discussed were few. “You perceive, gentlemen,” said Greene, opening the proceedings, “that our toils appear to have been all taken in vain. Apprised of Lord Rawdon's approach, the garrison will now hold out until the junction is effected, and for that we cannot wait, we are in no condition to meet Lord Rawdon single-handed. Colonel Conway, whose exertions merit my warmest acknowledgments, represents his force as quite too formidable for any thing that we can bring against him. He brings with him three fresh regiments from Ireland, the remains of the regiment of Boze, near six hundred loyalists whom he has mounted as cavalry, besides Coffin's dragoons;—in all, an army little short of three thousand men. To this we can oppose scarce eight hundred in camp and fit for duty; Marion and Sumter are too far, and too busy, below, to leave me any hope of their co-operation before Rawdon comes within striking distance; and the presence of his lordship in such force, will bring out Cunningham and Harrison, with all their loyalists, who will give sufficient employment for Pickens and Washington above. Retreat is absolutely necessary, but shall our labours here for the last month be thrown away? Shall we give up `Ninety-Six' without a struggle? Shall we not make the effort to gain the post, and behind its walls prepare for the reception of Rawdon?” The unanimous opinion of the council tallied with the wishes of the commander. The assault was resolved upon. The necessary orders were given out that night, and the army was all in readiness, on the morning of the 18th of June, to make the final attempt. The forlorn hope was led, on the American left, against the `Star' battery, by Lieutenants Seldon and Duval. Close behind them followed a party, furnished with hooks fastened to staves, whose particular duty it was to pull down the sand-bags which the enemy had raised upon their parapet. Colonel Campbell next advanced to the assault at the head of the 1st Maryland and Virginian regiments. These all marched under cover of the approaches, until they came within a few yards of the enemy's ditch. Major Rudolph commanded the forlorn hope on the American right against the stockade, supported by the legion infantry, and Kirkwood's Delawares. The forts, the rifle towers, and all the American works were manned, and prepared to sweep the enemy's parapet, previous to the advance of the storming party. Duval and Seldon were to clear the abattis and occupy the opposite curtain, then, driving off the enemy, were to open the way for the workmen. The sand-bags pulled down, Campbell was to make the assault, availing himself of their aid in clambering up the parapet. To Colonel Lee was left the assault upon the stockades, of which, when obtained, he was simply to keep possession, and await events. A discharge of artillery at noon, was the signal for the assault, which was followed by the prompt movement of the storming parties. An uninterrupted blaze of artillery and small-arms covered the advance of the forlorn hope; and, enveloped in its shadowing smokes, this gallant little band leapt the ditch and commenced the work of destruction. But the besieged who had so bravely and for so long time defended their ramparts, and whom the approach of Lord Rawdon had inspirited with renewed confidence, was prepared for their reception; and met the assault with equal coolness and determination. The assailants were encountered by bristling bayonets and levelled pikes, which lined the parapet, while a stream of fire, poured forth from intervals between the sand-bags was productive of dreadful havoc among them. The form of the redoubt gave to the besieged complete command over the ditch, and subjected the besiegers to a cross fire, which the gradual removal of the abattis only tended to increase. The day was lost—the hope of the assailants, small at the beginning, was now utterly dissipated, and mortified and pained, less at being baffled than at the loss of so many brave men, Greene gave the orders which discontinued the assault. Yet for near three quarters of an hour, did these brave fellows persist, notwithstanding the fall of two-thirds their number and both their leaders. This daring and enduring courage enabled them to occupy the curtain and maintain, hand to hand, the conflict with the garrison. They yielded at length, rather to the summons of their commander, than to their own fear of danger; the greater part of their men were killed or wounded, but the latter were brought off amidst the hottest fire of the garrison. The misfortune of Greene did not end here. The British general was at hand, and, the dead being buried, the American commander struck his tents and commenced the retreat which carried Clarence Conway still farther from a region in which all his feelings and anxieties were now deeply and doubly interested. We will not attempt to pursue his flight, but retracing our steps in a quarter to which he dare not turn, we will resume our march along with that of the British army, when they left the Middleton Barony, to advance upon Ninety-Six. But, in going back to Briar Park, it is not our purpose, at this time, to trespass again upon its inmates. We shall simply join company with our ancient friend, John Bannister, and trace his progress, as a prisoner, in the train of his captors. Watson Gray having been entrusted by Lord Rawdon with the exclusive disposition of this business, in consequence of the suggestions which the latter had made him the night before, had very naturally assigned the custody of the scout to the Black Riders, of whom, under a roving commission, Gray ranked as an inferior officer. He had every reason for believing the charge to be a secure one. Bannister had long been an object of dislike and apprehension to this troop, as he had on several occasions discovered their most secret haunts, and beaten up their quarters. His skill in the woods was proverbial, and dreaded by all his enemies accordingly; and the recent display which he had made, in the case of Gray himself of that readiness of resource which had rendered him famous, was very well calculated to mortify the latter, and make him desirous of subjecting his own captor, to all the annoyance likely to follow captivity. Whatever may have been the motives by which he was governed in this proceeding, the probability was apparent and strong that Supple Jack could not have been put into less indulgent custody; but circumstances baffle the wisest, and events, which are utterly beyond human foresight, suddenly arise to confound all the calculations of the cunning. John Bannister found a friend among the Black Riders when he little expected one. When the army came to a halt that night, which was not till a tolerably late hour, their camp was made on the northern side of the little Saluda, just within the line of the present district of Edgefield, a commanding spot was chosen for the bivouac, and every precaution taken to secure it from disturbance for the night. The preparations for supper produced the customary stir, but these were rapidly dismissed: excessive fatigue had lessened appetite, and sleep was alone desirable to the regiments which had been pressed forward to the utmost of their marching powers, from the very first moment of their leaving Charlestown. The intense heat of the climate, at that season, made this task an inappreciably severe one. The duties of the cavalry had been, if possible, still more severe than those of the infantry; compelled as they were to make continual and large circuits through the country, around the line of march of the army, in order to defeat the ambuscades of the Americans, which were not less frequent than successful. Group after group dispersed, and, hanging their martial cloaks in the trees above them, to guard them from the deleterious dews of the night, the warriors, one by one, resigned themselves to repose. The Black Riders were stationed beside a grove which skirted one of the forks of the little Saluda, and were not the last to avail themselves of the general privilege of sleep. A few trees sufficed to cover their entire troop, and they clustered together in several small bodies, the horses of each group being fastened to swinging limbs of trees close to those which sheltered their riders, in order that they might be ready at hand in any sudden emergency. In the centre of one of these squads lay John Bannister. He was bound hand and foot; the bandages upon the latter members being only put on for sleeping purposes and withdrawn when the march was to be resumed. A few rods distant, paced a sturdy sentinel, to whom the double duty was entrusted of keeping equal watch upon the horses and the prisoner. With this exception, Bannister was almost the only person whose eyes were unsealed by slumber in the encampment of the dragoons. He was wakeful through anxiety and thought, for though one of the most cheerful and elastic creatures breathing, he had too many subjects of serious apprehension, to suffer him to be sufficiently at ease in mind to enjoy that repose which his body absolutely needed. There was yet another reason to keep him wakeful. He was very far from being resigned to his fate. He had no taste for the condition of the prisoner, and the moment that found him a captive found him meditating schemes for his own deliverance. His plans had reference to himself entirely. He was one of those self-dependent people, who never care to look abroad for those resources which may be found within; and closing his eyes where he lay, and affecting the sleep which he could not obtain, he wearied himself with the examination of a hundred different plans for escaping from his predicament. While he lay in this position he heard some one approach and speak to the sentinel. A brief dialogue ensued between them, carried on in terms quite too low to be distinguished by him, but the tones of the stranger's voice seemed familiar to the ear of the listener. Bannister opened his eyes and discerned the two persons; but in consequence of the umbrage of the trees between he could only see their lower limbs; after a while one of them disappeared, and fancying that it was the stranger, and that the sentinel would again resume his duties, the prisoner again shut his eyes and tried to resume the train of meditation which the intrusion had disturbed. He had not long been thus engaged when he was startled by the low accents of one speaking behind the column of the tree against which his head was leant, and addressing him by name. “Who speaks?” he demanded in the same whispering tones in which he had been addressed. “A friend.” “Who?” “Muggs.” “What, Isaac?” “The same.” “Ah, you varmint! after I convarted you, you'll still follow the British.” “Hush!” whispered the other with some trepidation in his tones. “For God's sake, not so loud. Stockton VOL. II. 8 and Darcy and two more are jest under the oaks to the left, and I'm dub'ous they're half awake now.” “But how come you here, Muggs?” “Why, nateral enough. I hearn the army was on its march, and I reckoned there was guineas to be got on the march, in exchange for rum and sugar; so I hitched horse and wagon together, and turned sutler for the troop as I used to; and mighty glad are they to see me; and mighty glad I am to see you, John Bannister, and to try and give you a help out of your hitch.” “I'm dub'ous of you, Isaac Muggs. I'm afeard you aint had a full convarsion.” “Don't you be afeard. Trust to me.” “How? Trust to you for what? will you loose me— git me a horse, and a broadsword—hey? Can you do this for the good cause, Isaac, and prove your convarsion.” “Don't talk, but turn on your side a little, so that I can feel where your hands are tied. Be quick—I haint much time to spare. Ben Geiger, who is your sentry, is gone to my wagon to get a drink, and will be back pretty soon, and I'm keeping watch for him, and a mighty good watch I'll keep.” “There,—cut Muggs, and let me get up: but you must cut the legs loose too. They've hitched me under and over, as if I was a whole team myself.” “And so you are, John Bannister; but you mustn't git up when I cut you loose.” “Thunder! and why not, Muggs. What's the use of loosing foot and fingers if one's not to use them.” “Not jest yet; because that'll be getting Ben Geiger into a scrape and me at the back of it. You must wait till he's changed for another sentry, and till I gives the signal. I'll whistle for you the old boat horn tune that's carried you many a long night along the Congaree;—you remember?—well, when you hear that you may know that the sentry's changed. Then watch the time, and when the t'other sentinel draws off toward the horses, you can crawl through them gum bushes on all fours and get into the bay. As for the horse, I'm dub'ous there's no getting one easy. They'll make too much trampling. But I'll meet you on t'other side of the bay, and bring you a pistol, or sword, or whatever I can find.” “Well, well! You bring the sword and pistol. It'll be mighty hard where there's so many, if I can't find the nag myself.” “Work your hands:” said the landlord. “They're free, they're free;” was the exulting response of the scout, almost too loudly expressed for prudence. “Hush, for God's sake, and don't halloo until you're out of the bush. Take the knife now in your own hands, and cut loose you're feet. But you must lie quiet, and let the ropes rest jest where they are. Make b'lieve you're asleep till you hear my whistle, and then crawl off as if you were all belly, and wriggle away as quiet as a blacksnake. I must leave you now. It's a'most time for Ben Geiger to get back.” The scout did not await a second suggestion to apply the keen edge of the hunter's knife, which the landlord furnished him, to the cords which fastened his feet. These he drew up repeatedly with the satisfaction of one who is pleased to exercise and enjoy the unexpected liberty which he receives; but the suggestions of the landlord, which were certainly those of common sense, warned him to limit these exercises, and restrain his impatient members, till the time should arrive for using them with advantage. He accordingly composed himself and them, in such a manner as to preserve the appearance of restraint; arranged the perfect portions of the ropes above his ankles, and tucked in the severed ends between and below. Then, passing his hands behind him, as before, he lay on his back outstretched with all the commendable patience of a stoic philosopher awaiting the operations of that fate with which he holds it folly if not impertinence to interfere. The landlord, meanwhile, had resumed the duties of the sentinel, and was pacing the measured ground with the regularity of a veteran, and the firm step of one who is conscious of no lapse of faithfulness. The scout's eyes naturally turned upon him with an expression of greatly increased regard. “Well,” said he in mental soliloquy, “I was half dub'ous I'd have to lick Muggs over agen, before he could be brought to a reasonable way of thinking. I was mightily afeard that he only had half an onderstanding of the truth when I gin him that hoist on the Wateree; but it's a God's providence that orders all things, in his blessed marcy, for the best, and let's one licking answer for a stout man's convarsion. I'm dub'ous, if Muggs hadn't ha' lost one arm in the wars, if he would have onderstood the liberties we're fighting for half so easily. Liberty's a difficult thing to be onderstood at first. It takes mighty hard knocks, and a heap of thinking, to make it stand out clear in the daylight; and then it's never half so clear or half so sweet as when there's some danger that we're going to lose it for ever, for good and all. If ever I wanted to teach a friend of mine how to believe in the reason of liberties, I'd jist lock him up in a good strong jail for three months, or mou't be six, put on a hitch of ploughline on hands and legs, and then argy him to show that God made a mighty great mistake when he gin a man a pair of feet and a pair of hands when he might see for himself that he could sleep in the stumps at both ends and never feel the want of 'em. But there comes Ben Geiger, I suppose, and I must lie as if mine were stumps only. Lord! I'll show 'em another sort of argyment as soon as Isaac gins that old Congaree whistle. It's only some twenty steps to the wood, and I reckon it can't be much more to the bay, for the airth looks as if it wanted to sink mighty sudden. These chaps round me snort very loud—that's a sign, I've always hearn, of sound sleeping. I don't much mind the risk of getting off to the bay, but I'm getting too fat about the ribs to walk a long way in this hot weather. Noise or no noise, I must pick out one of them nags for the journey. Let 'em snort. I don't much mind pistol-bullets when they fly by night at a running horseman. They're like them that shoot 'em. They make a great bellowing but they can't see. Let 'em snort; but if I work my own legs this night, it'll be to pick out the best nag in that gang, and use him by way of preference.” Time moved very slowly, in the estimation of the anxious scout. Ben Geiger, the sentry, had resumed his watch and walk. Muggs had disappeared, and solemn was the silence that once more prevailed over the encampment. Two full hours had elapsed since the limbs of Bannister had been unloosed, and still he waited for the signal which was to apprise him that the moment for their use was at hand. But it came at last, the long wailing note, such as soothes the heart with sweet melancholy, untwisted from the core of the long rude wooden bugle of the Congaree boatman, as he winds his way upon the waters of that rapid rushing river. The drowsy relief-guard soon followed, and Ben Geiger disappeared to enjoy that luxury of sleep from which his successor was scarcely yet entirely free. He rubbed his eyes and yawned audibly while moving to and from with unsteady step along the beaten limits of his round. His drowsy appearance gave increased encouragement to the woodsman. But even this was not necessary to give confidence to so cool a temper, so cheerful a spirit, and so adroit a scout. The sentry had looked upon the prisoner and the horses in the presence of the guard when Geiger was relieved. Satisfied that all was safe, he had started upon his march; and, giving sufficient time to the guard to resume their own slumbers, Jack Bannister now prepared himself for his movement. This event, which would have been of great importance, and perhaps of trying danger to most persons in his situation, was really of little consequence in his eyes. With the release of his hands and feet he regarded the great difficulty as fully at an end. The risk of pistol-shot, as we have seen from his soliloquy, he considered a very small one. Besides, it was a risk of the war in which he was engaged, and one which he had incurred an hundred times before. On foot, he well knew that he could surpass the best runner of the Indian tribes, and once in the thick bay which was contiguous, he could easily conceal himself beyond the apprehension of cavalry. If he had any anxiety at all, it was on the subject of choosing a horse 8* from the cluster that were attached to the swinging limbs of the adjacent oaks. “There's a dark bay, I'm thinking, that, as well as I can make out in the moonlight, is about the best. The black is a monstrous stout animal, but too high and heavy for the sand roads. The gray is a little too showy for a scout that ought to love the shade better than the sunshine. I reckon I'll risk the bay. He ain't too heavy and he ain't too low. He has legs enough for his body, and his body looks well on his legs. He'll do, and if I could only take the saddle from the black and clap it on the bay, I'd be a made horseman. It's a prime English saddle, and I reckon the holsters don't want for filling. It's mighty tempting, but—” A favourable opportunity for making a movement now suggesting itself, his soliloquy was cut short. The scout had his eyes all around him. The sentinel's back was toward him, and he commenced his progress. To the citizen, uninformed in the artifices of Indian warfare, the mode of operations adopted and pursued by our scout, would have been one of curious contemplation and study. It is probable that such a person, though looking directly at the object, would have been slow to discern its movements, so sly, so unimposing, so shadowy as they were. With the flexibility of a snake his body seemed to slide away almost without the assistance of hands and feet. No obvious motion betrayed his progress, not the slightest rustling in the grass, nor the faintest crumpling of the withered leaf of the previous autumn. His escape was favoured by the gray garments which he wore, which mixed readily with the misty shadows of the night and forest. Amid their curtaining umbrage it was now impossible for the sentinel to perceive him while pursuing his rounds; and aware of this, he paused behind one of the trees on the edge of the encampment, and gently elevating his head, surveyed the path which he had traversed. He could still distinguish the sounds of sleep from several groups of his enemies. The moonlight was glinted back from more than one steel cap and morion, which betrayed the proximity of the Black Riders. There lay Stockton and Darcy and the rest of that fearful band whose pathway had been traced in blood along the Congaree and Saluda. More than one of the associates of the scout had fallen by their felon hands. The scout ground his teeth together as he surveyed them. How easy, with their own broadswords, to make his way, even at little hazard to himself, over severed necks and shoulders spouting with their gore. The feeling was natural to the man, but for an instant only. Bannister dismissed it with a shudder; and turning warily in another direction, he proceeded to put in execution his design of choosing the best horse from among the group, for the purpose of making his flight as agreeable to himself, and as costly to his enemies, as was possible. Circumstances seemed to favour him, but he never forewent his usual caution. He proceeded with sufficient gentleness, and produced no more disturbance among the animals than they habitually occasioned among themselves. His closer examination into their respective qualities confirmed the judgment which he had previously formed while watching them from a distance. The dark bay was the steed that promised best service, and he succeeded with little difficulty in detaching him from the bough to which he was fastened. To bring him forth from the group, so as to throw the rest between himself and the sentinel's line of sight, was a task not much more difficult; and but little more was necessary to enable our adventurous scout to lead him down the hill side into the recesses of the bay, in the shade of which he could mount him without exposure, and dart off with every probability of easy escape. But courage and confidence are very apt to produce audacity in the conduct of a man of much experience; and our scout yearned for the fine English saddle and holsters which were carried by the black. Dropping the bridle of his bay, therefore, over a slender hickory shoot; he stole back to the group, and proceeded to strip the black of his appendages. But, whether the animal had some suspicions that all was not right in this nocturnal proceeding, or was indignant at the preference which the scout had given in favour of his companion over himself, it is certain that he resented the liberties taken by the intruder in a manner that threatened to be more fatal to the fugitive than all the pistols of the encampment. He proceeded by kicking and biting to prove his jealousy and dislike, and this so effectually, as to make it a somewhat difficult matter for the scout to effect his extrication from the group, all of whom were more or less restive, and prepared to retort upon the black the sundry assaults which, in his random fury, he had inflicted upon them. This led to a commotion which attracted the attention of the sentinel, and his challenge, and evident approach, compelled Bannister to discard his caution and betake himself with all expedition to the steed which he had captured. He darted forward accordingly, and the sharp bang of the pistol followed his appearance on the back of the steed. This, though it awakened only the merriment of the fugitive, aroused the whole encampment. There was no time for contemplation;—none for the expected conference with the landlord. John Bannister knew this. He cast an instinctive glance to the northern heavens, as if seeking for their guiding star, then pricking his steed with the point of his knife, they dashed away with a hurry-scurry through the woods that defied their intricacies, and seemed to laugh at the vain shouts and clamour of the Black Riders, who were seeking to subdue to order, with the view to pursuit, their now unmanageable horses. The circumstance that had led to the discovery of Bannisters' flight, availed somewhat to diminish the dangers of the chase. Before the refractory steeds could be quieted, and the dragoons on the track of his flight, the tread of his horse's heels was lost entirely to their hearing. They scattered themselves, nevertheless, among the woods, but were soon recalled from a pursuit which promised to be fruitless; while Bannister, drawing up his steed when he no longer heard the clamours of his pursuers, coolly paused for a while to deliberate upon the circumstances of his situation. But a few moments seemed necessary to arrive at a resolution; and, once more tickling his horse's flanks with the point of his knife, he buried himself from sight in the darkest recesses of the forest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. SHADOWS AND STRAWS UPON THE SURFACE. The excitement at the Middleton Barony was succeeded by something of a calm; but not its usual calm. It had now other tenants than those whose quality and sex had maintained its peace along with its purity. The chief of the outlaws, attended closely by his faithful adherent, Watson Gray, was still its inmate; and there was yet another stranger, in the person of a nice, dapper surgeon's assistant, to whom Rawdon had given the wounded man in charge. This young gentleman was named Hillhouse. He was clever enough in his profession. He could take off a leg in the twinkling of an eye; but he was one of that unfortunate class of smart young persons who aim at universal cleverness. There was no object too high for his ambition, and, unhappily, none too low. He philosophized when philosophy was on the tapis, and “Hear him but reason in divinity,” you would have fancied the British camp was the very house of God, and the assistant surgeon the very happiest exponent of his designs. He talked poetry by the canto, and felicitated himself on the equal taste with which he enjoyed Butler and Cowley—the antipodes of English poets. But, perhaps, his happiest achievement was in the threading of a needle, and to see him in this performance was productive of a degree of amusement, if not real pleasure, which could neither be described easily nor well estimated. His adroitness was truly wonderful. Armed with the sharpened thread in one hand, and the needle in the other—his lips working the while with singular indefatigableness—his left foot firmly planted in the foreground, his right thrown back, and poised upon the toe;—and he laughed to scorn the difficulty which the doubtful eye of the needle seemed to offer to his own. His genius, though universal, lay eminently this way. He had the most marvellous nicety of finger in threading needles that ever was possessed by mortal. Unhappily, he was not satisfied with a distinction so notable. He aimed to be something of a gallant—a roué—a universal conqueror. His complaisance was prodigious, where the sex was concerned. Poor young creatures!—how he pitied them! How he regretted, in the language of Goethe, that though “Art is long, life is short;” and there is but one life to execute all the desires even of universal genius. He would willingly have had himself cut up in little for their sakes, could the ubiquitous attributes of his mind, have availed for the several subdivisions of his body. But, as this could not well be done, he could only sigh for their privations. Fancy, with such complaisance, the person of the ugliest “Greathead” in existence—a man, with a short neck, head round as a bullet, eyes like goggles, and a nose as sharp as a penknife; a mouth which could hold a pippin, and was constantly on the stretch as if desiring one. Fancy, yet farther, such a person in the house with a woman like Flora Middleton, smirking indulgently upon that damsel, and readily confounding the cool contempt with which she regarded him, as only a natural expression of that wonder which his presence must naturally inspire in a country girl, and it will not be difficult to anticipate some of the scenes which took place between them whenever it was the fortune of the gallant to be thrown into company with the maiden. Mr. Hillhouse was too provident of time in all matters, to suffer any of his talents to remain unemployed, when he could arrange it otherwise. Love-making was regarded as one of these. It was not with him a matter of passion or of sentiment. He had not a single sensibility at work. It was simply as an accomplishment, and as an exercise for his accomplishments, that he condescended to smile upon the fair, and to confer those affections which he otherwise affected to solicit. He himself had no affections—perhaps such a creature never has. He was deficient in that earnestness of character without which the sensibilities are forms rather than substances—the shows of things which only delude, and never satisfy the desires of the mind. He had scarcely seen Flora Middleton before he had planned her conquest. While examining the wounds of Morton, in connexion with the head surgeon, he was turning over in his mind, and framing the words of that salutation which he was to address, on the first occasion, to that young lady. It was not many hours after Rawdon's departure, before he commenced his operations. The breakfast-table was the scene. Mrs. Middleton, whom the fatigues and alarms of the night had overcome, was not present; and, looking sad and unhappy, Flora took her seat at the coffee-board. Mr. Watson Gray and Mr. Hillhouse appeared at the first summons, though the latter did not seem conscious that the room was blessed with any other presence than his own, and that other with whom he condescended to converse. Watson Gray, with sufficient good sense, smiled, took his seat, and said nothing beyond what was required of good breeding. But the surgeon, with less sense, was much more ambitious. The events of the night, the military movements of the dawn, and the beauty of the morn which succeeded, furnished him with ample topics. He was in hope that the “spirit-stirring drum and earpiercing fife,” and so forth, had not vexed too greatly the slumbers of Miss Middleton;—a wish that the young lady answered with a grave nod, and an assurance which her countenance belied, that she never felt better in her life. The weather, the never-failing topic, enabled him to dilate copiously from the poets—Milton being the first at hand—with an almost literal description. “A most lovely morning, Miss Middleton; and here you may be said to realize the truth of Milton's description of another region.” Hemming thrice, to relieve himself from an obstruction in the throat which he did not feel, he proceeded, in a sort of chant, to give the beautiful address of Eve to Adam,—beginning, “Sweet is the breath of morn, he rising sweet With charm of earliest birds,” &amp;c. &amp;c. But nothing could exceed the unction of his look and gesture, when, approaching the conclusion of the apostrophe, he betrayed by his look, tone, and action, the true reason why the selection had been made— “But neither breath of morn, when she ascends With charm of earliest birds; nor rising sun, On this delightful land; nor herb, tree, flower, Glistening with dew; nor fragrance after showers; Nor grateful evening mild; nor silent night With this her solemn bird; nor walk by moon Or glittering starlight, without thee is sweet.” “In truth, sir, your selection is very appropriate. The description, at this season of the day and year, is very correct, when applied to our Congaree country. One would almost fancy that Milton had been thinking of us. At least, our self-complaisance may well take the liberty of applying his verses as we please. But, sir, do tell me how your patient is.” This was all said with the most indifferent, matter-of-fact manner in the world. The answer to the inquiry was lost in the professional knowledge which enveloped it. A long, painful jargon ensued, on the subject of wounds in general; then followed an analysis of the several kinds of wounds—gun-shot, rifle, sabre, pike, bayonet, bill, bludgeon—wounds in the head and the hip, the shoulder and the leg, the neck and the abdomen. “But of all wounds, Miss Middleton, I feel at this moment more than ever convinced that the most fatal are those which are inflicted upon the human heart.” This was followed by a glance of the most inimitable tenderness, while the hand of the speaker rested upon the region, the susceptibilities of which were alleged to be so paramount. “Your opinion, sir,” said the young lady, with becoming gravity, “is confirmed by all that I ever heard on the subject. Indeed, sir, our overseer, who is an excellent judge in such matters, and who was at one time the only butcher in Charlestown,—prefers shooting a steer through the heart always, in preference to the head. He asserts that while death is certain to follow the hurt in the one region, it is a very frequent circumstance that the hardness of the other renders it impenetrable to the bullet, unless the aim be very good and the distance be very small. But you, sir, ought to be the best judge of the correctness of this opinion.” Watson Gray made considerable effort to suppress the grin which rose in spite of him to his visage, but Mr. Hillhouse did not see it, and was not conscious of the latent meaning in what Flora Middleton had said. He thought to himself, “This is a very simple girl, certainly—a mere rustic. I shall have no trouble with her;” and he proceeded to offer some objections to the opinion of the overseer, to all of which Flora Middleton assented with the air of one who is anxious to get rid of a wearisome person or subject. But the surgeon was not to be shaken off so easily, and every question which she found it necessary to propose, however simple or little calculated to provoke dilation, only had the effect of bringing about the same results. The same jargon filled her ears—the same inflated style of compliment offended her taste; and in answer to the third or fourth inquiry as to the condition of his patient, he assured her that “Wounds were either fatal or they were not. Death might follow the prick of a needle, VOL. II. 9 while a man has been known to survive even a puncture of the heart itself;”—here followed another significant glance at the lady;—“but,” he continued, with the air of a man who declares the law, “while there is life there is hope.—Hope, as we are told by our little poet of Twickenham, `hope springs eternal in the human breast;' and the last person, Miss Middleton, whom hope should ever desert, should be the surgeon. So many have been the marvellous cures which the art of man has effected, that he should despair of nothing. Nothing, you know, is impossible with Providence,— perhaps, I should say, with art; for many have been its successes, which ignorance has falsely and foolishly attributed to miraculous interposition. Miracles, Miss Middleton, are not common things. I am of opinion, though I would not have you suppose me sceptical or irreligious, that a great many events are represented as miraculous which owe their occurrence to natural and ordinary laws. There was an instance—it came under my own observation in the island of Jamaica—” “Pardon me, sir, if you please, but if your patient can longer spare your presence, mine cannot. I am to understand you then, as of opinion that Mr. Conway can only survive by what is ordinarily considered a miracle; but which, I am to believe, will be then wholly ascribable to your professional skill?” “I reckon, Miss Middleton,” said Watson Gray, rising from the table as he spoke, “that Mr. Conway stands a good chance of getting over it. He's got some ugly cuts, but he hasn't much fever, and I don't think any of the wounds touch the vital parts. I've seen a good many worse hurts in my time, and though I'm no doctor, yet I think he'll get over it by good nursing and watching.” Mr. Hillhouse was greatly confounded by this interposition. His eyebrows were elevated as Watson Gray went on, and he permitted himself to exhibit just sufficient interest in the interruption as to wheel his chair half round, and take a cool contemptuous look at the speaker. The latter did not wait for reply or refutation; and the simple directness of what he said, was sufficiently conclusive to Flora, who rose also, and— the gentlemen having finished breakfast—prepared to leave the room. But Mr. Hillhouse was not willing to suffer this movement. He had still more knowledge to display. “Do not be deceived by this person, Miss Middleton, —a very cool person, certainly, not wanting in presumption—a strange person—I should judge him to be the overseer of whom you have spoken?” “No, sir; I only know him as one of the friends of Mr. Conway.” “Ah,—a friend of Mr. Conway—a very strange selection. There is nothing about which gentlemen should be so careful, as in the choice of friends. A friend is a man—” “Excuse me, sir,—but may I beg your attention, at your earliest leisure, in the chamber of the young woman. Her delirium seems to be increasing.” “It will give me pleasure to obey your requisitions, Miss Middleton; but let me warn you against forming your judgment, upon the subject of Mr. Conway's condition, from the report of this person—this overseer of yours. I doubt not that he's an excellent butcher, Miss Middleton, but, surely, it is obvious to you that the art of taking life and that of saving it, are very different arts. Now, I suspect, that he could tell very nearly as well as myself what degree of force it would be necessary to use in felling a bullock, but the question how to bring the same bullock to life again—” “Is surely one that is better answered by yourself, and I should consult you, sir, were it ever necessary, in preference to every body else.” The surgeon bowed at the compliment, and with undiminished earnestness, and more directness than usual, returned to his subject, if subject he may be said to have, who amalgamated all subjects so happily together. “Mr. Conway, ma'am, is not so bad as he might be, and is a great deal worse, I'm disposed to think, than he wishes himself to be. His wounds are not deadly, though he may die of them; yet, though life itself be but a jest, I must consider them serious. This overseer of yours is right in some things; though, I suspect, he only reports my own remarks to Lord Rawdon, made this morning, ere his lordship took his departure. I told his lordship that I considered the case doubtful, as all maladies must be considered; for you know that there is no certainty in life, but death. He has fever, and that is unfavourable; but, as he has little fever, that is favourable. In short, if he does not suffer a great change for the worse, I trust that he will get better. Nay, I may admit that I have hopes of it, though no certainties. The surgeon who speaks of certainties, in such matters, is—pardon me, Miss Middleton—little better than a fool.” “I thank you, sir; you have really enlightened me on many subjects. I am very much obliged to you. You must have seen a great deal of the world, sir.” “The world! Miss Middleton, I have sounded it every where. I have basked on the banks of the Niger; I have meditated at the foot of the Pyramids; have taken my chibouque with a Pacha, and eaten sandwiches with the Queen of Hungary. I have travelled far, toiled much; spent five years in India, as many in the West Indies, two in South America; and yet, you see me here in South Carolina, still nothing more than second surgeon to a little army of less than five thousand men, commanded by a general, who—but no matter! Lord Rawdon is a good soldier, Miss Middleton, but, burn me! a very poor judge of good associates.” “You must have left your maternal ties at a very early period, to have travelled so far, and seen so much.” “Apron strings” softened into “maternal ties,” did not offend the surgeon's sensibilities. “A mere boy, Miss Middleton; but it is surprising how rapidly a person acquires knowledge, who starts early in pursuit of it. Besides, travelling itself is a delight—a great delight—it would do you good to travel. Perhaps, were you to go abroad only for a single year, you would feel less surprised at the extent of my acquisitions.” “Indeed, sir, do you really think so?” “I do, 'pon my honour, I do. Your place here is a very fine one. You have, I understand, some ten thousand acres in this estate—the Old Barony it's called —slaves in sufficient number to cultivate it, and really every thing remarkably attractive and pleasant. I can very well understand how it is that you should not care to leave it even for a season; but if you only knew what a joy travelling is—to go here and go there—see this thing and that—be asked to this fête and that palace; and know that the whole gay world is looking for your presence and depending on your smile; if you once knew this, Miss Middleton, you'd give up your acres and your slaves, your barony and all its oaks; think them all flat, stale, and unprofitable—you'd—” “Oh, sir, excuse me. You are too eloquent. If I remain longer, I shall be persuaded to go; and I must go in order to remain. Good morning, sir. I trust that you will devote your earliest leisure to the poor young woman.” The surgeon bent and bowed almost to the ground, while his hand was pressed to his lips with the air of exquisite refinement which distinguished that period. The dandy is clearly human. All ages have possessed the creature under one guise or another. The Roman, the Greek, the Egyptian, the Hebrew, all the Asiatics, the English and the French, have all borne testimony to their existence; and, perhaps, there is no dandy half so ultra in his styles as the Cherokee or the Chickasaw. Nature and art both declare his existence and recognise his pretensions. In this point of view, common sense can urge no objections to him. He clearly has an allotted place in life, and like the wriggling worm that puts on a purple jacket and golden wings, though we may wonder at the seeming waste of so much wealth, we cannot deny its distribution, and must suppose that the insect has its uses however unapparent. The exquisite may stand in the same relation to the human 9* species as the jay or the peacock among the birds. These teach the vanity of their costume while displaying it: as the man of sense learns to avoid the folly, even in degree, which is yet the glory of the fool. “Charming creature!” exclaimed the dandy, yawning and throwing himself backward on the cushions of the huge sofa, which stood temptingly contiguous —“Charming creature! She deserves some pains-taking. Her person is not fine but her lands are;—her beauties are few, but her slaves are many. She is rather simple, perhaps—but, gad, my soul!—he is hard indeed to satisfy whom these fine grounds, excellent mansion, good lands, charming groves, and balmy atmosphere would not reconcile to any sacrifices. We must make it, some day or other, all of us; and thou, Augustus Hillhouse, be thou not too nice! Already hast thou suffered many a choice fleshly dainty to slip through thy fingers because of thy fastidious stomach. Beware! Thou art wasting time which is precious. Age will come upon thee! Age! ah!”—with a shiver —“it will need fine mansion, and noble park, and goodly income, to reconcile that to thy philosophy. `In the days of thy youth,' saith the proverb. I will take counsel of it in season. The damsel's worth some pains-taking, and the sacrifice is not without its reward. But such a gown and stomacher as she wears! I must amend all that. There is also an absence of finish in the manner, which too decidedly betrays the rustic. Her voice, too, hath a twang—a certain peasant-like sharpness which grates harshly upon the ear. But these things may be amended!— Yes, they may be amended. I must amend them, certainly, before I can commit myself among my friends; for what would Lady Bell, who is a belle no longer, say to such a bodice, such a stomacher, and above all to a carriage which shows a degree of vigour so utterly foreign to good breeding. I must teach her languor, and that will be the worst task of all, for it will require exertion. She must learn to lounge with grace, to sigh with a faint-like softness, to open her eyes as if she were about to shut them, and, when she speaks, to let her words slide out through the tips of her lips as if she were striving all she could, short of positive effort, to keep them in! Ah, charming Bell, sweet Lady Charlotte, and thou, dearest of all the dears, fair Moncrieff, could this barony-girl grow wise in those things in which ye are so excellent, and how much lovelier were she than all of ye! Ye are landless, sweet ladies— and therefore ye are loveless. These acres weigh heavy against your charms. Augustus Hillhouse, be not foolish in thy fastidiousness. Take the fruits which the gods bestow upon thee, and quarrel not with the bounty because of the too much red upon the apple. It is a good fruit, and the red may be reconciled, in due season, to a becoming delicacy.” The dandy soliloquized at greater length, but neither his euphronism nor his philosophy finds much favour in our sight. We are not of that class of writers who delight in such detail, and we shall not accordingly— and this omission may surprise the fashionable reader —furnish the usual inventory of Mr. Hillhouse's dress and wardrobe. Enough that it was ample even for his purposes, and enabled him to provide a change, and a different colour, for every day in the month. He had his purple and his violet, his green and his ombre, the one was for the day of his valour, the other, for his sentiment, the third for his love-sadness, and the fourth for his feeling of universal melancholy. We shall only say, that his violet was worn at his first interview with Flora Middleton. While his head ran upon his marriage, a measure which he had now certainly resolved upon, it was also occupied with certain incidental and equally important topics, such as the dress which should be worn on such occasion; for the day of his marriage was the only day he had never before provided for; and the subsequent disposition of the goods and chattels which he was to take possession of with his wife. Stretched at length upon the cushions, with one leg thrown over an arm of the sofa and the other resting upon the floor, his head raised upon the pillows, which had been drawn from both extremities for this purpose;—his eyes half shut in dreamy languor, and his lips gently moving as he whispered over the several heads of topics which engaged his reflection; he was suddenly aroused by hearing the fall of a light footstep behind him. At first he fancied that it might be one of the servants, but a negro is usually a heavy-heeled personage, who makes his importance felt upon the floor, if nowhere else; and when, in the next moment, Mr. Augustus Hillhouse remembered this peculiarity in his nature, he fancied that the intruder could be no other than the fair rustic whose acres he was then disposing of with the most mercantile facility. Nothing could be more natural than that she should very soon find her way back to the spot where it was possible to find him. Under this impression, he started to his feet with an air of well-practised confusion; and having been at some pains to throw into his countenance an excess of sweetness and sensibility, he turned his eyes, as he fancied, upon the fair intruder, to meet—not the lady of his love, nor one of the gentler sex at all—but a man, and such a man! Never was creature so wofully confounded as our young gallant. The person who encountered his glance, though but for an instant only, was the very picture of terror —gaunt terror—lean misery, dark and cold ferocity. Clothed in the meanest homespun of the country, and that in tatters, the tall, skeleton form of a man, stood in the doorway, evidently receding from the apartment. In his eyes there was the expression of a vacant anger —something of disappointment and dislike—a look of surprise and dissatisfaction. In his hand, at the moment of his disappearance, Mr. Hillhouse fancied that he saw the sudden shine of steel. But he was so completely confounded by the apparition that he was for a few moments utterly incapable of speech; and when he did speak, the spectre disappeared. “Who are you, and what do you want?” was the shivering inquiry which he made. A savage grin was the only answer of the stranger, and the next instant the surgeon stood alone. “The devil—sure!” he exclaimed; but recovering his courage, he darted after his strange visiter. He rushed into the passage-way—out into the porch—ran down the steps, looked out into the court—but in vain. He could see nobody. Even the sentinels, whom he knew to have been placed at the portals, front and rear, were withdrawn; and no object more suspicious than a lame negro met his eye in the whole range of vision that lay within it. He re-entered the house, more than ever satisfied that he had been favoured with a visit from a personage whose intimacy implies brimstone and other combustibles; and a sudden resolution to resume his duties, and see at once into the condition of his patients, whom he began to think he had too long neglected, was the result of his supernatural visitation. The first object of his care was the person of the outlaw—not because of his superior claims, or worse condition, but simply because he felt his nerves too much agitated to encounter the young lady in whose presence it was necessary to practise that nice and deliberate precision of tone and manner, language and address, which form the first great essentials of successful euphuisme in all ages. Regarding Watson Gray as a mere circumstance in a large collection of dependencies —a sort of hanging peg, or resting port, a mounting block, or a shoetie, in the grand relationships of society —he had no scruple at exhibiting his real emotions in his presence; and he poured forth to the cooler and more rational scout the intelligence of which he was possessed. Gray regarded the surgeon as a fool, but had no reason to suppose that he was a liar. He saw no reason to doubt that he had seen somebody, and concluded that his alarm had somewhat magnified the terrors of what he saw. But his description of the costume worn by the visiter was so precise and particular, that he well knew that neither the fears nor the follies of the other could have caused his invention of it; and with graver looks than he himself was aware of, he descended instantly to the lower story. There, he found the sentinels, each at his post, and they swore they had been so from the beginning. This one circumstance led the scout to think more lightly of the surgeon's story; but there was still something in the description which had been given him that he could not dismiss from his consideration. He searched the immediate neighbourhood of the premises, but without discovering any thing to awaken his suspicions. He saw nothing; but a keen watchful eye followed his progress, every step which he made, along the avenue. The father of Mary Clarkson had survived the conflict of the preceding night. It was his spectre which had so fearfully alarmed the contemplative surgeon. He had good reason for his alarm. His sudden movement alone, which enabled the vindictive old man to discern the petite and popinjay person of the surgeon, saved him from the sharp edge of the uplifted knife. The couteau de chasse of the woodman—an instrument not unlike the modern bowie-knife—had, at one moment, nearly finished the daydreams of Mr. Hillhouse and his life together. Finding nothing on his search like the object described, Watson Gray was disposed to think that the surgeon had seen one of the soldiers on duty, who had probably found his way into the mansion with the view of employing his eyes or his fingers—for the moral sense of the invading army, officers and soldiers —does not seem to have been very high;—but this idea was combated by the fact that Hillhouse had been for many years, himself, a member of the British army, and knew, as well as any body, the costume of its several commands. The nervous excitement of the surgeon, which was not overcome when Gray returned to the chamber, was another argument against this notion. But a new light broke in upon Watson Gray when he remembered the ancient superstition along the Congaree. “You've seen the ghost of the Cassique,” he said, with a conclusive shake of the head—“old Middleton walks, they say. I've heard it a hundred times. He used to wear homespun and a hunting-shirt—though I never heard it was ragged—and the big knife and rifle was never out of his hands. The Congaree Indians used to call him King Big Knife, and, sure enough, he made it work among their red skins whenever they came about his quarters and didn't carry themselves rightly. He was a most famous hunter, and between the bears and the savages, the knife and rifle had very little rest with him. I reckon it's him you've seen, though it's something strange for a ghost to walk in broad day-time.” The surgeon was not entirely satisfied with this explanation; not because it seemed very unreasonable, but simply because it clashed with his habitual philosophy. “Ah, my good friend,” he exclaimed, patronizingly— “I see you labour under some very vulgar errors. The belief in ghosts is entirely done away with. Ghosts, like continental money, had their value only so long as the people had credulity. The moment you doubt, the ghosts disappear, and the money is rejected. They found credit only among a simple people and in the early stages of society. As Philosophy—divine not crabbed as dull fools suppose—as Philosophy began to shed her beams upon the world”—&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Watson Gray had already ceased to listen, and we may as well follow his example. Talking still, however, while working about the wounds of his patient, the surgeon at length awakened another voice, and the faint, but coherent words of the outlaw, summoned the scout to his bedside. “Where am I?—what does all this mean, Gray?” But the surgeon interfered, and for five minutes expatiated on the great danger to a patient situated as he was, in using his own, or hearing the voice of any but his professional attendant. “Nothing, my good sir, can be more injurious to the nervous system, particularly where there is any tendency upward—any mounting of the blood to the brain! I have known numberless instances, where the results have been fatal, of the most trifling conversation. Once in India, a colonel of cavalry, as brave a fellow as ever lived—Monkton—a noble fellow—dressed like a prince—won every woman he looked at, and was happy in never being made to marry any—he suffered from a gunshot wound got in a desperate charge which he made at the head of his regiment, upon the native troops. The rajah himself fell—and my poor friend Monkton—” “Pshaw!” feebly exclaimed the outlaw—but with an emphasis and manner sufficiently marked to be offensive. “Pshaw! pshaw! sir—I do not understand—” The wounded man interrupted him— “Pray do: only be silent, while I hear what my friend says. Come hither, Gray.” “I warn you, sir—I wash my hands of the responsibility!” exclaimed the now indignant surgeon. “Gray, can't you turn that fool fellow from the room,” said Morton in a tone which was only inaudible to Hillhouse from the feebleness of the speaker. But no such steps were necessary. The indignant surgeon availed himself of the moment to obey the requisition of Miss Middleton, and visit his other patient: and the outlaw and his subordinate were left undisturbed to a long, and, to them, not an uninteresting conference. This conference had relation to many events and interests which do not affect the progress of this narrative, and do not accordingly demand our attention; but we may add, that no portion of the intelligence which Watson Gray brought his commander was of half the interest, in his mind, as those events which we have previously related, in the occurrences at Briar Park, after the moment of Edward Morton's insensibility. “That I live at all is almost miraculous,” was the remark of the outlaw; “for I had goaded him”—meaning his brother—“almost to desperation, and when my hand failed me I looked for death.” “But why do this?” was the earnest inquiry of Gray—“why, when so much was at stake? I thought you had made it your chief care, and believed it your correct policy, particularly as concerns Miss Flora, to keep him in the dark. Why tell him all—why goad him with this knowledge?” “So it was my policy, and so I had resolved; but the devil and my own passions drove me to do it; and some other feelings which I could not well account for. Hate, hate, hate!—was at the bottom of all, and I suppose I needed blood-letting.” “You have had it—enough of it.” “Ay, but I live in spite of it, Watson Gray, and I feel that I shall still live. I shall not die this bout—not while I am here—here in the same house with her, and while all things below are, as you tell me, ripe and favourable. This alone is enough to cure wounds thrice as numerous and thrice as deep as mine. I am here with her, and let me but use these limbs once more, and the victory and the prize are mine. I will wear them, Watson Gray, with a savage joy which shall find triumph in a thousand feelings which confer any thing but joy. She shall know and he shall know what it is to have felt with feelings such as mine.” The outlaw sank backward with exhaustion, and Watson Gray found it necessary to enforce the suggestions of the surgeon, and to impose upon the speaker that restraint which his weakness showed to be more than ever necessary. This was a difficult task; the outlaw being impatient to hear particulars, and dilate upon hopes and passions, which filled all the secret avenues of his soul with joy! It was only by warning him of the danger of defeating every thing by tasking his powers prematurely, that he was subdued to silence; but his lips still worked with his desire to speak, and while he lay with shut eyes upon his couch, almost fainting with exhaustion, his heart heaved with the exulting images which fancy had already arrayed before his mind, in preparing his contemplated triumph. That triumph included the possession of Flora Middleton, and his escape with her, and other treasures, only VOL. II. 10 less valuable in his own estimation, and of far greater value in that of his confederate. Already he was dreaming of groves in the West Indian Islands;—of a safe retreat from the snares of enemies; and of the possession of those charms which had equally warmed his mind and his passions. Dreaming, he slept; and Watson Gray availed himself of his repose to snatch a brief hour of oblivion from the same auspicious influence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. GUILT, AND ITS VICTIM. The course of the surgeon, when he left the chamber of the outlaw, naturally tended to the apartment of his other patient. The indignation which he felt at the conduct of Morton, in rejecting, in terms of such contempt, his counsel to silence; expedited his movements, and, muttering while he went, the discomfiture which he felt, he found himself in the presence of Miss Middleton before he had entirely smoothed his ruffled front for such a meeting. But Mr. Hillhouse prided himself on his possession of all those nice requisites which constitute, par excellence, the ladies-man. Among these may be reckoned a countenance which no unruly passions could ever discompose. He started with an air of studied, theatrical modesty, when, at the entrance of the chamber, he saw the young lady;—passed his kerchief once over his face, and the magic consequences of such a proceeding, were instantly apparent. The wrinkles and frowns had all disappeared, and sweet sentiment and deliberate love alone appeared upon that territory which they had unbecomingly usurped. The surgeon approached trippingly, and in a half whisper to Flora, communicated his apologies. “I still tremble, Miss Middleton, for I had almost ventured into your presence with an angry visage. The truth is, I am sometimes susceptible of anger. My patient in the opposite apartment proves to be unruly. He has annoyed me. He rejects good counsel, and he who rejects counsel need not take physic. Counsel, Miss Middleton, has been happily designated, the physic of the soul, and can never be rejected—” “Except when given as physic, sir,—but will you look at this poor young woman; I am afraid you can do but little for her. She grows worse every moment.” “A-hem!—The limit to human art has not yet been found, Miss Middleton. The patient has frequently been rescued from the very fingers of death. My own successes in this respect have been numerous and remarkable. I remember once in Ceylon, some time in the autumn of 1772, I had a case of this very sort, and a young woman too. She fractured her skull by falling from a window, in an effort to reach her lover. The affair occasioned no little sensation at the time. The parties were something more than respectable on all sides; but an unconquerable aversion to her lover which her father entertained, threatened to defeat their desires. You need not be told, Miss Middleton, that where a young woman loves, she will do any thing to secure the object of her attachment. He was worthy of her. He was an Irishman, his name Macartney,—and certainly, for that day, had the most inimitable taste in the arrangement of his cravat, of any man I ever knew. He could make a pendant to it, a sort of n\œud Gordienne, which I would defy the prettiest fingers in the world to unravel. The knot appeared like a ball, a single globe, from which hung two lappets, being the open ends of the kerchief. Sometimes, with singular ingenuity, he would alter the design so as to leave but one lappet, and then, it might be likened to a comet, with a tail,—such an one as I saw at Paris, in 1769. I doubt if you were then quite old enough to have seen that comet, but you may have heard of it. It had a most prodigious tail—fully sixty degrees in length, as computed by the astronomers.” It was with a degree of disgust, almost amounting to loathing, that Flora Middleton listened to the stuff of the voluble exquisite, poured forth all the while that he pursued his examination into the hurts of his patient. It seemed shocking that one could speak at such a moment, on any subject but such as was essential to the successful performance of the task in hand; but that he should enlarge on such wretched follies, with so much suffering before his eyes, seemed to her still more shocking, strange, and unnatural. It will be remembered that Flora Middleton was a country girl, to whom the resources and employments of the conventional world of fashion, were almost entirely unknown, except from books; and if she heard any thing of such extravagancies in them, they were very likely to be thrown by, as too silly for perusal, and too idle for belief. The plaintive moans and occasional ejaculations of the poor girl offered the only interruption to the garrulity of the surgeon, but did not seem to awaken any feeling. He commented on this insensibility, by a quotation from Shakspeare, which served for the time to divert him entirely from the subject. “`How use doth breed a habit in a man!' I do believe, Miss Middleton, though I should think just as much of her as before, and feel just as desirous of doing her a service, that I could take off the leg of my grandmother with as much composure and indifference, as perform on the most indifferent stranger. Did you ever have a tooth drawn, Miss Middleton?” He urged this question with great gravity, but did not wait for the answer. “A painful operation to the patient, decidedly, and the only surgical operation which I have any reluctance to perform. My objection arose from a very rational circumstance. When in my teens, and a student—a time as you perceive not very remote, Miss Middleton, though my worldly experience has been so extensive and so rapid—I was called upon to extract a tooth from the mouth of a young lady, the daughter of a singing-master in Bath. She was very nervous, and gave me a great deal of trouble to get her to submit. But I had scarcely got my finger into her mouth,—being about to use the lancet,—when—look what a mark!”—showing his finger—“it will last me to my grave, and, as you 10* see, disfigures terribly the entire member!—She closed her jaw upon me, and—ah! I feel the thrill of horror even now, which seemed to run through my whole system. Nay, by my faith, would you think it,—not content with taking hold, she seemed no way disposed to let go again, and it was only by main force that she was persuaded to recollect that my finger had no real or natural connection with her incisors. Young ladies are said to keep possession of their favourites with a tenacity peculiar to themselves, but a mode like this, Miss Middleton, you will readily admit, was neither loving nor ladylike.” As she looked and listened, Flora could scarce forbear the exclamation of “unfeeling fool;” while the reflection which has occurred to every mind which has ever observed and thought, suggested to hers the strong identity which exists between the extremely callous and cold nature, and that in which levity seems a leading characteristic. The extremes inevitably meet. The bear can dance, and the monkey, which is one of the most sportive, if not the most formidable, is one of the most malignant of the wild tribes of the forest. A frivolous people is apt to be a savage people, and the most desperate Indian warriors prefer the looking-glass worn about their necks to any other ornament. While the surgeon was prating in this fashion he was extorting groans from the poor girl whose hurts he examined without seeming to hear their utterance; and the finger which he presented for examination as that which had so much suffered from the jaws of the lady of Bath, was touched with the crimson hues from the fractured skull which he had been feeling. Mr. Hillhouse was considered a good surgeon in the British army—and, it may be, that the very callosity which shocked the sensibilities of Flora Middleton, would not only commend him to the rough soldier, who acquires from his daily practice, an habitual scorn of the more becoming humanities, but was, indeed, one cause of his being an excellent operator. His skill, however, promised to avail nothing in behalf of his female patient; and when, at length, after a thousand episodes, Flora obtained from him his final opinion, though it said nothing, it signified much. The mournful presentiments of the poor girl, expressed to her betrayer but a few days before, promised to be soon realized. Her wounds, mental and bodily, were mortal. Her mind was gone. Her body was sinking fast. The seat of reason was usurped by its worst foe; and delirium raved with unabashed front and undisputed presence, over the abandoned empire of thought. Wild and wretched, were the strange and incoherent expressions which fell from her lips. Now she spoke of her childhood—now of her father,—and when she spoke of him her eyes would unclose and shudderingly steal a hasty glance for a few moments around the chamber—meeting the gaze of Flora Middleton, they would suddenly turn aside, or fold themselves up again, as if anxious to exclude a painful object from their survey. But there was one name which, like the keynote in an elaborate strain of artificial music, sounds ever prelusive to the rest; and the keen ear of Flora heard with surprise the frequent iteration, in tones of the most touching tenderness and entreaty, of the name of Edward. Never even did the listener conjecture to whom this name applied. It was the name of the father, perhaps the brother, the dear friend; but never once did she fancy the true relation which made it dear, and fatal as it was dear, to the unhappy victim. Could she have guessed the truth,—could she have dreamed, or in any way been led to a prescience of the truth, how would that suffering, but proud heart, have melted at the stern cruelty which its injustice was momently doing to the faithful but absent lover. Her meditations were those of the unsophisticated and puresouled woman. “I will not let her suffer,” she murmured to herself while she sat beside the dying creature. “I will not let her suffer, though, poor victim, she little fancies how much suffering her presence brings to me. Her miserable fall, and wretched fortunes, shall not make her hateful in my sight. God keep me from such cruel feelings, and strengthen me against temptation. Let me treat her kindly, and not remember to her detriment, that Clarence Conway has been her destroyer. Oh, Clarence, Clarence! You, of whom I thought such pure and noble thoughts;—you, who seemed to me so like a man in excellence, as man was when he spoke unabashed in the presence of the angels—how could you stoop to this baseness, and riot on the poor victim, abusing the fond attachment which proved her only weakness, and which, in the eye of him she loved, should have been her chief security and strength.” Had Flora Middleton lived more in the world, and in the great cities thereof—she might have been less severe in examining the supposed conduct of her lover. Her soliloquy might have been softened, as she reflected upon the numbers among her sex, vicious and artful, who save the betrayer some of his toils, and are caught sometimes in their artifices; but of this class of persons she had no knowledge, and did not even conjecture their existence. She took it for granted that Clarence Conway was the one who was wholly guilty —his victim was only weak through the strength of her attachment. The warmth of her own regards for her lover enabled her to form a correct idea of that over-powering measure which had been the poor girl's destruction; and thinking thus, she had no indulgence for him, whom she regarded as one recklessly, and without qualification, wicked. But the truth is, even Edward Morton, the real wrong-doer, had not, in this case, deserved entirely this reproach. There was some truth in the sarcasm which he uttered to Mary Clarkson, when he told her that her own vanity had had considerable part in her overthrow. She felt the partial truth of the accusation, and her own reproaches followed on her lips. It would be doing injustice to the outlaw, were we to describe him as indifferent to her situation. There was still something human in his nature,—some portion of his heart not utterly ossified by the selfishness which proved its chief characteristic. In the long and earnest conversation which followed, between him and his confidante in his chamber after the exclusion of the surgeon, he had asked and received all the information which could be given on the subject of the events which had made her a victim to a like misfortune, and in consequence of the same circumstances as himself. He did not know the fact, nor could Watson Gray inform him, that she received her hurts because of the feeble attempt which she made to come to his relief. But, all the circumstances led to this conviction, and when the outlaw re-surveyed the ground over which he had gone, and her unvarying devotedness through the long and perilous period of strife, toil, and danger, which had marked his footsteps!—when he remembered how many had been her sacrifices, how firm had been her faith,—the only one true, amid the many false, or doubtful, and only secured by purchase;—when the same train of thought reminded him, that, for all this devotion, she had received few smiles, and no love, from the very person for whom alone she smiled, and who monopolized, without knowing how to value, all the love of which she was capable;—it was then, possibly for the first time in his life, that the cold and keen reproaches of remorse touched his heart. “I have done the poor creature wrong—I have not valued her as she deserved!—See to her, Gray, for God's sake, and let that fool of a surgeon, if he can do any thing, not spare his efforts. If she survives I will make amends to her. I will treat her more kindly; for, never has poor creature been more faithful; and I'm inclined to think that she must have been hurt in some idle attempt to come to my succour. You say you found her on the same spot?” “Very nearly.” “Surely, Clarence Conway could not have drawn weapon upon her!” “You forget. She was dressed in men's clothes, and in the darkness of the evening.” “Yes, yes,—but still a mere boy in appearance, and there never was a brighter moonlight. No body would have used deadly weapon upon one whose form was so diminutive and evidently feeble. She was sick, too,— she told me so,—but I had heard her complain so often, that I gave her no credit for sincerity; and sent her back to watch those d—d plotting scoundrels in the swamp. Would the fiends had them!” We need not pursue this dialogue further. The exhaustion of the outlaw left him temporarily oblivious on the subject of the girl; but, towards evening, starting up from a brief, uneasy slumber, his first inquiry was into her condition. When told that her skull was fractured, that she was raging with fever and delirium, the outlaw sank back, shut his eyes, and, though awake, lay in a rigid silence, which showed the still active presence of those better feelings of which it was his misfortune to possess but few, and those too feeble for efficient and beneficial service. How small was their effect, may be judged from the success of the means employed by Watson Gray to divert his mind from the gloomy fit into which he seemed to have fallen. That vicious adherent seized the moment to inform him of the steps he had taken to lay the wrong done her innocence at the door of Clarence Conway, and to convey this impression to Flora Middleton. The exultation of a selfish hope came in to silence remorse, and the outlaw opened his eyes to eulogize the prompt villany of his confederate. “A good idea that, and it can do poor Mary no harm now; and how looks Flora since she heard it? Have you seen her since?” “Yes: she looks twice as tall, and ten times as haughty as before.” “Flora Middleton to the life! The Semiramis or Zenobia of the Congaree. As proud as either of those dark, designing dames of antiquity. She fancied that you were pitying her whenever your eyes turned upon her face, and after that her only effort was to make herself seem as insensible and indifferent as if she never had a heart. Ah! Gray, my good fellow, only get me on my legs again before Rawdon is compelled to take to his, and if I do not carry the proud damsel off from all of them, I deserve to lose all future stakes as well as all the profits of the past. Keep that fool fellow of a surgeon from probing me, simply that he may use his instrument and fingers, and let him only do what you think necessary or useful. I can't well believe that such a civet-scented thing as that can possibly be of any use, except to wind silk, or tend upon poodles; and would sooner have your doctoring than that of the whole tribe. Get me my limbs again, and the rest is easy.” What was that rest? What were those hopes which gave such a tone of exultation to the voice and language of the wounded man? We need not anticipate. The conjecture is only too easy. What should they be, springing in such a rank soil, and born of such seed as his criminal hands had planted? Dark, deep, and reckless, was the determination of his soul; and wily, in the highest degree, was the confederate to whose aid in particular, its execution was to be entrusted. At this moment it need only be said that, in the minds of the conspirators, nothing appeared to baffle their desires but the condition of their chief. All things seemed easy. The fortune they implored, the fiend they served, the appetitie which prompted, and the agents they employed, all subservient, were all in waiting; and he who, of all, was to be most gratified by their services,—he alone was unable to make them available. Well might he curse the folly which had brought him to his present state, and denounce the feebleness which delayed the last and crowning achievement on which his hopes and desires were now set. His soul chafed with impatience. He had no resources from thought and contemplation. He could curse, but he could not pray; and curses, as the Arabian proverb truly describes them, are like chickens, that invariably come home to roost. They brought neither peace nor profit to the sick bed of the invalid, and they kept refreshing slumbers from his pillow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. PHILOSOPHICAL DOUBTS AND INQUIRIES. The angry feelings which the conduct of the outlaw had produced in the bosom of Mr. Surgeon Hillhouse, had driven, for the time, another affair from his recollection about which he was particularly desirous to speak with Miss Middleton or her grandmother. A ramble in the woods that same morning enabled him to recover his temper and, with it, his recollection; and when the dinner things were removed that day, he fairly conducted the old lady to the sofa, placed himself beside her, and with looks big with the sagacious thought, and busy speculation, he propounded himself as follows in a language new to him of sententious inquiry. “Mrs. Middleton—madam—pray oblige me by letting me know what sort of a looking person was your grandfather?” “My grandfather, sir—my grandfather!” “Yes, madam, your grandfather—how did he look— how did he dress—was he tall or short—stout or slender. Did he wear breeches of blue homespun, a tattered hunting shirt of the same colour and stuff; and was his couteau de chasse as long as my arm?” “My grandfather, sir! Why, what do you mean?” “No harm, no offence, believe me, Mrs. Middleton— on the contrary, my question leads to grave doubts, and difficulties, and, possibly, dangers! No idle or impertinent curiosity occasions it. Philosophy is seriously interested in your reply.” “My grandfather, sir—why he has been dead these hundred years! I do not think I ever saw him.” “Dead a hundred years! Impossible! Eh! How can that be?” demanded the surgeon in astonishment scarcely less than that which the old lady herself had manifested at the beginning;—“dead a hundred years? Really, Mrs. Middleton—there must be some mistake.” “Indeed, sir—then it is yours, not mine. My grandfather has been dead more than a hundred years. He died in France somewhere in 1680—or '81—” “Oh he died in France, did he? You are right, madam, there is a mistake, and it is mine. To be sure it was not your grandfather about whom I wished to know;—it was Miss Middleton's grandfather.” “My husband, sir!” said the old lady bridling with dignity, while her keen gray eyes flashed with all the vivacity of girlhood, as she conjectured the utterance of something impertinent from her companion. The surgeon felt his dilemma. “Your husband, Mrs. Middleton,” he stammered— “Can it be? Miss Middleton's grandfather your husband?” “And why not, sir, when I have the honour to be her grandmother?” “True, true, most true, madam, but—” “It does not alter the case very materially, sir, so far as you are interested. Your right is just as great to inquire into the private history of her grandfather as of mine. Pray, proceed in your questions, sir, if as you think, so much depends upon it. We are retired country people, it is true, Mr. Millhouse—” “Hillhouse, madam—Augustus Hillhouse, of his majesty's—” “Pardon me, sir—Mr. Hillhouse—I was simply about to encourage you to ask your question by assuring you that, though retired and rustic, we are still not utterly insensible, on the banks of the Congaree, to the claims of philosophy. I trust to see her schools established VOL. II. 11 here before I die,[1] [1] A hope which the venerable lady in question lived to realize. The College of South Carolina, at Columbia, has been long in successful operation, and has the good fortune to have sent forth some of the best scholars and ablest statesmen in the Union. Its increasing prosperity induces the confident assurance that it will long continue a career of so much usefulness and good.—Editor. and may, possibly, have the pleasure of hearing you, yourself, expounding from one or other of her sacred chairs.” The surgeon bowed low at the unexpected compliment without perceiving the smile of irony by which it was accompanied. “Ah, madam, you do me too much honour. I am but poorly fitted for the high station which you speak of. It is true, I am not indifferently read;—I have seen the world—a fair proportion of it at least;—and am considered very generally as a man fond of serious and severe investigations in the kindred temples of science and of nature, but—” “Oh, sir, I have no sort of doubt that you will do well in any of the departments, and if ever we should be so fortunate as to obtain our liberties again, I have no doubt you will be thought of for some such situation.” “Ahem!—ahem!” The termination of the sentence, which intimated a hope of British expulsion, was scarcely palatable to the surgeon. “But, sir, on the subject of Miss Middleton's grandfather—my husband—the late General Middleton— what would you please to know?” “Ahem—why, madam, the case presents itself in an aspect of increased difficulty. I had somehow confused it at first, and fancied when I spoke that I was addressing you on the subject of a very ancient relation. The connection being so close—” “Makes no sort of difference, sir, if your question conveys nothing disrespectful.” The reply of the old lady bewildered the surgeon yet farther. He was not sure that something disrespectful might not be conveyed to a very sensitive and jealous mind, in any form of the question, which was to solve his difficulties. In this state of bewilderment, with something of desperation in his air, he proposed another inquiry, seemingly so foreign to the previous topic that Mrs. Middleton began to think him insane as well as silly. “Mrs. Middleton, do you believe in ghosts?” “Ghosts, sir!—a very singular question.” “Exactly so, madam, but it is a part of the subject.” “Indeed, sir!” “Yes, ma'am, and I should be really very grateful if you would say whether you do or do not believe in that supernatural presence—that spectral visitation— that independent embodiment in shape of limbs, sinews and substance of the immortal spirit—which is vulgarly entitled an apparition, or ghost? Professionally, madam, as a surgeon, I'm not prepared to look farther than the physical organization for the governing powers of the human form. A soul is a something that has eluded hitherto all the aims of the anatomist, and the only authority which exists for such an agent, seems to me to be derived from testimonials, more or less authenticated, of the presence and reappearance of those whom we have considered dead, and no longer capable of the uses and purposes, the feelings and the desires, of life. Now, madam, something of my first inquiry depends upon my last. Pray oblige me then, by saying whether you do or do not believe in this marvellous anomaly. Do you believe in ghosts or not?” “Well, sir, to oblige you, though I am at a loss to see the connection between the one question and the other—” “It's there—there is a connection, believe me.” “Well, sir, under your assurance, or without it, I can have no objection to say that I am very doubtful what to believe on such a subject. So much has been said on both sides—and I have heard so many wonderful stories about such things, from persons of such excellent credit, that—” “Enough, enough, madam, I see you are not altogether incredulous. Now tell me, madam, did you ever yourself see a ghost?” “Never, sir.” “Never!—nor any thing, shape, substance, or person, that ever looked like one, or looked like nothing else but one, or that you had reason to suppose was one, or that resembled any departed friend, relative, tie, connection, dependance—in short, did you never see any thing that a suspicious mind might not have readily taken for a ghost?” “Never, sir, to my recollection.” “Well, madam,” continued the surgeon, taking courage from his own motion, “on your answer will depend the very important doubt whether I, Augustus Hillhouse, second surgeon in his majesty's 87th regiment of foot, have not been favoured by the visitation of the late General Middleton—” “Sir!” exclaimed the old lady rising with a most queenly air of dignity and pride. “Yes, madam, that's it!” replied the surgeon, rising also, and rubbing his hands together earnestly. “Here, while I lay on this very sofa, this very morning, after the breakfast was over, and Miss Middleton had gone —here, alone, I was favoured by the sudden presence of one who might have risen from the floor, and, as far as I could see, sunk into it; who might have been— nay, as I have heard, must have been;—but on this head I would have your testimony, and for this reason did I desire to learn from you in what costume it was usually the custom for General Middleton to appear? Oblige me, my dear madam, by a clear and particular description of his dress, his weapons, his height, breadth, general appearance, the length of his nose, and of his hunting-knife—” “Sir, this freedom—this scandalous freedom!” exclaimed the venerable matron. “Do not be offended, Mrs. Middleton. I am governed, my dear madam, by no motives but those of the philosopher. I would thank you, then—” “Sir, I must leave you. You trespass, sir, beyond your privilege. The subject is a sacred one with the widow. Let me hear no more of it.” “But, my dear madam—one question only:—was he a tall person, slender, rather scant of frame—such a person as is vulgarly called raw-boned—” “No more, Mr. Hillhouse, if you please.” “But his dress, madam—and his nose.” “Good morning, sir.” “His knife—was it long, very long—long as my arm?” The matron bowed, as she was retiring, with a stern glance of her gray eye, which would have confounded any person but one so thoroughly absorbed in his philosophical follies as to be utterly incapable of observation. He pursued her to the foot of the stairs with a degree of impetuous eagerness, which almost made the old lady fancy that he purposely sought to offend and annoy her—a conjecture which by no means served to lessen the hauteur of her retiring movements. “But, my dear madam, one word only”—implored the surgeon in an agony of entreaty;—“touching his costume—only say whether it was of blue homespun, rather lightish in hue;—were his smallclothes rather scantish, and of the same colour;—and his hunting frock;—was it not a little tattered and torn about the skirts, and on the shoulder?—and— `She goes, and makes no sign!”' was the sad quotation from Shakspeare, with which he concluded, and which fitly described the inflexible silence in which the matron effected her departure. “Devilish strange animal is woman! Here now is a question materially affecting the greatest mystery in our spiritual nature; which a word of that old lady might enable me to slove, and she will not speak that word. And why? Clearly, she was quite as anxious for the truth at the beginning as I was myself. But the secret is, that her pride stood in the way. Pride is half the time in the way of philosophy. Had her husband, instead of appearing in the ordinary guise of one of the 11* natives—which must be confessed to be a very wretched taste—but put on scarlet breeches on his ghost—the old woman would have been willing to acknowledge him. But she was ashamed of a ghost—even though it were her own husband—who should reappear in dingy blue homespun. And she was right. What ghost could hope to find faith, or respect, who paid so little attention to his personal appearance? It seems to me, if I should ever have any desire to `revisit the glimpses of the moon,' and the favour were afforded me, I should be at quite as much trouble in making up my toilet as I am now. Nay, more, for the task would be accompanied by increased difficulty. The complexion of a ghost would require a very nice selection of shades in costume. Whether my violet would not be the most suitable? Really, the question increases in interest. I shall certainly study it carefully. The delicacy of the violet is an argument in its favour, but some deference must be shown to the universal judgment of ages which represents ghosts as commonly appearing in white. To this, the case of Hamlet's father and General Middleton furnish the only exceptions. I must consult with myself, my pocket mirror, and the lovely Flora Middleton!” This dialogue and these grave reflections resulted in the temporary exhaustion of the surgeon. He yawned listlessly, and once more threw himself upon the sofa where he had been favoured with his ghostly visitation; but, on this occasion, he took special care that his face should front the entrance. Here he surrendered himself for a while to those dreaming fancies with which the self-complacent are fortunately enabled to recompense themselves for the absence of better company; and passing, with the rapidity of insect nature, from flower to flower, his mind soon lost, in the hues which it borrowed as it went, every trace of that subject to which it had been seemingly devoted with so much earnestness. Meanwhile Mrs. Middleton joined her granddaughter in the chamber of poor Mary Clarkson. It needed not the voice of the surgeon to declare that she must die;— and all his professional jargon could not have persuaded the spectator, who gazed upon her pale and wretched features, to believe that she could by any possibility survive. The eternal fiat had gone forth. The messenger of mercy—for such, happily, was the angel of death, to her—was on his way. She might sink in a few hours, she might live as many days, but she was evidently dying. But there was a strange life and brightness in her eyes. The vitality of her glance was heightened by delirium into intense spirituality. She keenly surveyed the persons in attendance with a jealous and suspicious glance, the cause of which they could only ascribe to the mind's wandering. Her eyes turned ever from them to the entrance of the apartment; and once, when Flora Middleton went to place an additional pillow beneath her head, she grasped her hand convulsively, and murmured with the most piteous accents— “Take him not from me—not yet—not till I am dead, and in the cold, cold grave. Why will you take him from me? I never did you harm!” Very much shocked, Flora shuddered, but replied: “Of whom speak you, my poor girl?—what would you have me do?” “Of whom?—of him? Surely you know?—of Conway. Take him not from me—not—not till I am in the grave. Then!—oh!—then—it will not need then! No! no!” The interval of sense was brief, but how painful to the listening maiden! “Fear nothing!” said Flora somewhat proudly. “God forbid that I should rob you of any of your rights.” “Oh! but you cannot help it—you cannot help it!” cried the sufferer. “I know, I know what it is to love; —and to suffer for it! But, will you not let me see him;—let me go to him—or bid them bring him here to me. I cannot die till I have seen him.” “That cannot be, my poor girl, he is not here—he is gone. I trust that God will enable you to live to see him.” “He is gone! You mean that he is dead! Ha!— can it be that? I did not come in time! I saw them fight! I heard them swear and strike—hard—heavy blows, with sharp steel. Oh God, that brothers should fight, and seek to destroy each other! I called to them to stop, but I saw their heavy blows, and when I ran to part them—I fell, and such a pain. My poor, poor head! He killed us both—the cruel brother—he killed us both with his heavy blows.” “My poor girl,” said Flora, “do not make yourself miserable with this mistake. Believe what I tell you. Mr. Clarence Conway is in no danger—he escaped. The only sufferer is Mr. Edward Conway, who is hurt. He lies in the opposite chamber.” The words of the speaker were drowned in the shrieks of the sufferer, now, once more, a maniac. Successive screams of a mixed emotion—a something of delight and agony in the utterance—followed the communication of Flora Middleton, and were followed by a desperate effort of the poor girl to rise from the bed and rush from the apartment. It required all the strength of an able-bodied female slave, who watched with her young mistress in the apartment, to keep her in the bed; and the restraint to which she was subjected only served to increase her madness, and render her screams more piercing and intolerable than ever. Her wild, anguished words filled the intervals between each successive scream. But these were no longer coherent. When she became quieted at length, it was only through the exhaustion of all the strength which sustained her during the paroxysm. Strong aromatics and strengthening liquors were employed to restore her to consciousness; and the exquisite from below, startled from his dreaming mood by the summons of the servant, was sufficiently impressed by the painful character of the spectacle he witnessed, to apply himself to the task of restoring her, without offending the good taste of the ladies by the exercise of his customary garrulity. She was brought back to life, and the keen scrutiny of Flora Middleton discovered, as she fancied, that her senses were also restored. There was an air of cunning in the occasionally upturned glance of her half-shut eye, which forced this conviction upon the spectator. When Flora changed her position, the eye of the sufferer followed her movements with an expression of curiosity, which is one of the most natural forms of intelligence. She had also become, on a sudden, excessively watchful. Every sound that was heard from without aroused her regards, and when she saw that she was noticed by those around her, her own glance was suddenly averted from the observer, with an air of natural confusion. These were signs that warned Flora of the necessity of giving her the most patient and scrupulous attention. It was obvious to all that she could not survive that night. The surgeon, rubbing his hands at nightfall, gave his ultimatum to this effect; and yielded up his charge as hopeless; and the gloomy feelings of Flora Middleton were somewhat modified when she reflected that death could not possibly be a misfortune to one to whom life seemed to have borne only the aspects of unmixed evil. What should she live for? More neglect —more shame—more sorrow! The blow that forces the victim to the dust, and mocks at his writhings there. Mary Clarkson had surely endured enough of this already. It could not be the prayer of friendship which would desire her to live only for its sad continuance; and to live at all, must be, in the case of that hapless creature, to incur this agonizing penalty. But Flora Middleton could still pray for the victim. For giveness might be won for her errors, and, surely, where the penalties of folly and of sin are already so great in life, the mercy of Heaven will not be too rigorously withheld. This was her hope, and it may well be ours.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. THE AVENGER BAFFLED. The screams of the maddened victim of his lust and selfishness, had reached the ears of Edward Morton in his chamber. They had startled him from slumbers, which, no doubt, had their images of terror, such as thronged about the couch of Richard, and sat heavy upon his soul. The piercing agony of those shrieks must have strangely tallied with his dreams, for he started almost erect in his couch, his eyes wild and staring, his hair moist and upright, his words broken, thick, and incoherent. His attendant, Watson Gray, who had been a faithful watcher beside his couch, ran to him, and pressed him gently back upon the pillows, using such language as he fancied might soothe to quiet his nervous excitation; but, as the shrieks were continued, and seemed to acquire greater volume with each successive utterance, there was still an influence, beyond his power of soothing, to keep the guilty and wounded man in a state of agitation. “What mean these hideous cries, Gray? was there not some one besides yourself in my chamber before they began? Did they take nobody hence—now, now —but now?” “No! you have been dreaming only. You are feverish. Be quiet,—on your keeping quiet depends every thing.” “So it does; but can't you silence those noises? I should know those tones. Can it be—are they Mary's? Is she dying?” The question was put by the outlaw in low, husky tones, which were scarcely audible. The answer was necessarily uttered in the affirmative, though Gray was reluctant to speak the truth, and would have readily availed himself of a falsehood, had a plausible one that moment suggested itself to his mind. “They are operating upon her, perhaps?” continued Morton; “that d—d fellow of a surgeon!—he cares not what pain he gives her.” “No, Captain, there is no operation necessary. The doctor says it'll be all over with her soon. He's given her hurts the last dressing that she'll ever need.” “Ha! she will then die! She told me of this! I remember; but I did not believe! I would to God she might be saved, Gray! Can nothing still be done? See the surgeon; let him do his best. I'm afraid you've let her suffer.” “No, every thing's been done. Old Mrs. Middleton and Miss Flora have been nursing and watching her the best part of the time themselves.” “And there is then no hope? Poor Mary! Could she be brought up again, I should be more kind to her, Gray. I have been more of a savage to that poor, loving creature, than to any other human being; and I know not why, unless it was that she loved me better than all others. What a strange nature is that of man —mine, at least. How d—nably perverse has my spirit been throughout;—actually, and always, at issue with its own blessings. Ah! that shriek!—shut it out, Gray—close the door—it goes like a sharp, keen arrow to my brain!” Under the momentary goadings of remorse, the outlaw buried his face in the bed-clothes, and strove to exclude from hearing the piercing utterance of that wo which was born of his wickedness. But, for a time, the effort was in vain. The heart-rending accents pursued him, penetrated the thin barriers which would have excluded them from the ears of the guilty man, and roused him finally to a state of excitement which Watson Gray momentarily dreaded would drive him to a condition of delirium little short of hers. But, suddenly, the cries of terror ceased; so suddenly, that the outlaw started with a shudder at the unexpected and heavy silence. “It is all over with her. She is dead. Go you and see, Gray. Quickly, go, and tell me. Poor Mary! I could have been more just to her had her claims been less. I cannot believe that she is dead. No! no!— not yet; though once I was wretch enough to which it. Forgive me! God forgive me, for that wish!” The voice of the outlaw subsided to a whisper. A cold shudder passed through his frame. His eyes were closed with terror. He fancied that the freed spirit of the woman whom he supposed dead, hovered above him, ere it took its final departure. Even the whispering accents which followed from his lips broke forth in spasmodic ejaculations. “Forgive me, Mary; forgive! forgive! I should have loved you better. I have been a wretch—a cold, selfish, unfeeling wretch! I knew not your worth— your value—and now! Ha! who is there? who?—ah, Gray, is it you? Sit by me; take my hand in yours. Well, she is gone—she sleeps.” Gray had resumed his place by the bedside, while the eyes of the trembling criminal were closed. His approach startled the nervous man with a thrilling confirmation of the partial supernatural fear which had before possessed him. “She sleeps,” said Gray, “but is not dead. Her paroxysm has gone off; and, perhaps, she will only waken when death comes on.” “Ah! what a foolish terror possessed me but now. I fancied that she was beside me!—I could have sworn I heard her faintly whispering in my ears. What a coward this weakness makes me.” “Try to sleep, Captain. Remember how much depends upon your soon getting well. We have a great deal to do, you know.” “Ah, true; you are a cool, sensible fellow, Gray. I will try to sleep, but those dreams—those hideous dreams. Keep beside me, Gray,—do not leave me.” The slight reference which Gray had made to his worldly schemes and grosser passions, recalled the outlaw to his habitual self. He turned his head upon the pillow, while Gray took one of his hands quietly within his own. Sitting thus beside him, it was not long before he discovered that the outlaw had sunk into an equal slumber; and releasing his hold, he laid himself down at the foot of the bed, under the influence of a natural exhaustion, which soon brought a deeper sleep upon his senses than that which possessed those of his superior. Night meanwhile stole onward with noiseless footstep, and a deep silence overspread the whole barony. The sleep of the outlaw was long, deep and refreshing. It indicated a favourable condition of his wounds, such as Watson Gray had predicted. The poor victim in the neighbouring chamber seemed to sleep also, but her repose promised no such agreeable results. The lamp of life was flickering with uncertain light. The oil of the vessel was nearly exhausted. Flora Middleton approached her about midnight, and so still was her seeming sleep, so breathlessly fast did her slumbers appear, so composed her features, and so rigid her position, that the maiden was struck with the dread lest the last sad change had already taken placed. But, as she stooped over the face of the sleeper, her silken ringlets were slightly shaken by the faint breathing from her half-closed lips, which still betrayed the presence of the reluctant and lingering life. She appeared to sleep so sweetly and soundly that Flora determined to snatch a few moments of repose also. She needed such indulgence. She had robbed herself of many hours of accustomed sleep, in watching and waiting upon the wakeful sufferings of her involuntary guest. Calling in the servant, whose own slumbers never suffered impediment or interruption in any situation, she resigned the invalid to her care, giving her special instructions to VOL. II. 12 keep a good watch, and to summon her instantly, when any change in the patient was at hand. Mira, the negro woman to whom this trust was given, was one of the staid family servants, such as are to be found in every ancient southern household, who form a necessary part of the establishment, and are, substantially, members, from long use and habit, of the family itself. The children grow up under their watchful eyes, and learn to love them as if they were mothers, or at least grandmothers, maiden aunts or affectionate antique cousins, who win their affections by bringing bon bons in their pockets, and join them in all their noisy games. They rebuke the rudeness of the young, follow their steps in their errant progress; warn them of danger, and put them to bed at night. Mira was one of these valuable retainers, who had watched the childhood of Flora, and received from the latter all the kindness which she certainly deserved. “Now, Mommer,” said Flora, at leaving her, “don't go to sleep. You've slept all the evening, and can surely keep wakeful till I come. Call me the moment the poor girl wakens, or if you see any difference.” Mira promised every thing, took her seat beside the couch of the patient, and really set out with a serious determination to keep her eyes open to the last. But when did a negro ever resist that most persuasive, seductive, and persevering of all influences in the South, particularly in the balmy month of June? When did sleep deign to solicit, that he was not only too happy to embrace? Mira soon felt the deep and solemn stillness of the scene. The events of the few days previous had excited her along with the rest; and the exhaustion of her faculties of reflection, which is always a rapid affair in all the individuals of her race, necessarily made her more than ever susceptible to sleep. To do her all justice, however, she made the most strenuous efforts to resist the drowsy influence. She began several grave discussions with herself, but in an undertone, on the occurrences of the week. She discussed the merits of the sundry prominent persons she had seen,—Rawdon and the Conways,—not forgetting the assistant surgeon, whom she resolved was either a prince or a “poor buckrah” in his own country, but which—and a vast interval lay between—she did not undertake to say. But the lamp burned dimly in the hearth—the shadows that flitted upon the walls, in correspondence with its flickering light, increased the gloom—the patient beside her was apparently sunk in the deepest slumber, and it was in vain for the poor negro to contend with the magnetic influence. Her head was gradually bent forward, and, at length, lay upon the bedside. It was not long after this when she slept quite as soundly as if this blessing had never before been vouchsafed her. When she slept the patient ceased to do so. With that cunning which is said to mark most kinds of delirium, she had feigned the slumbers which she was never more to know. She perceived that she was watched—she knew that she was restrained; and, sane on one subject only, she had employed the little sense that suffering had left her in deceiving her keepers. From the moment when she was told that Edward Morton occupied a neighbouring chamber, the only desire which remained to her in life was to see him before she died. For this had she raved in her paroxysm, but they did not comprehend her; and the strong leading desire of her mind had so far brought back her capacities of thought and caution, as to enable her to effect her object. When she saw Flora Middleton leave the chamber, her hopes strengthened; and, when the negro slept beside her, she rose from the couch, stealthily, and with a singular strength, which could only be ascribed to the fever in her system, and the intense desire—a fever in itself—which filled her mind. With a deliberation such as the somnambulist is supposed to exhibit, and with very much the appearance of one, she lifted the little lamp which was burning within the chimney, and treading firmly, but with light footstep, passed out of the apartment into the great passage-way of the mansion, without disturbing the fast-sleeping negro who had been set to watch beside her. Meanwhile, her miserable and scarcely more sane father, was inhabiting the neighbouring woods, and prowling about the premises of Briar Park, as the gaunt wolf hovers for his prey at evening, around the camp of the western squatter. The woods formed a convenient and accustomed shelter, and but little was required to satisfy his wants. He had but one large, leading appetite remaining, and food was only desirable as it might supply the necessary strength for the gratification of that appetite. Animal food did not often pass his lips—ardent spirits never. The stimulus derived from the one desire of his soul was enough for his sustenance. Roots, acorns, and such stray bounty as could be stealthily furnished by the neighbouring farmer or his slave, from the cornfield or the potato-patch, had been, since the beginning of the Revolution, the uncertain resource of all the “poor bodies that were out.” As one of these, Clarkson now found it easy to obtain the adequate supply of his creature wants, while in the neighbourhood of Briar Park. He soon discovered that he could approach the negro houses, the kitchen, and finally, the mansion itself, without incurring much, if any risk. The soldiers who had been left behind, nominally to protect the ladies, but really as a safeguard to the wounded outlaw, were careless upon their watch. Though stationed carefully, and counselled earnestly by Watson Gray, they saw no cause for apprehension; and conjectured that the scout simply cried “wolf,” in order to establish his own importance. He cautioned and threatened them, for he knew the sort of persons he had to deal with, but as soon as his back was turned, they stole away to little nooks in the wood, where, over a log, with a greasy pack of cards, they gambled away their sixpences, and sometimes their garments, with all the recklessness which marks the vulgar nature. Clarkson soon found out their haunts, watched them as they stole thither, and then traversed the plantation at his leisure. In this manner he had ascertained all the secrets that he deemed it necessary to know. As his whole thought was addressed to the one object, so he neither asked for nor heard the information which concerned any other. To know where Edward Conway lay was the only knowledge which he desired; and this information he gained from one of the house servants. He had once penetrated to the door of the outlaw's chamber, but, on this occasion, a timely glimpse of Watson Gray and Mr. Hillhouse, warned him that the hour of vengeance must still farther be delayed. That night, however, of which we have spoken, seemed auspicious to his object. The skies were cloudy, and the moon obscured. A faint gray misty light pervaded the extent of space. The woods looked more gloomy than ever beneath it, and when the sentinels found that the mansion had sunk into its usual evening quiet, they stole away to an outhouse, and were soon swallowed up in the absorbing interests of Jamaica rum and “old sledge.” Clarkson looked in upon them as he went forward to the house, but he took no interest in them or their proceedings, when they were once out of his way. He penetrated to the house without interruption, ascended the stairs, and passed with impunity into the very chamber of the outlaw. The lamp was nearly extinguished in the chimney. A faint light was thrown around the apartment, not sufficient to penetrate the gloom at the remoter ends of it, and it had been particularly placed in such a manner as to prevent it from playing upon the suffering man. In consequence of this arrangement, the greater part of the couch lay entirely in shadow; and while Clarkson was looking about him in doubt which way to proceed, he distinguished the person of Watson Gray, lying almost at his feet upon the floor. A glance at his face sufficed to show that he was not the man he sought; and, passing around the body of the sleeper, he cautiously approached the bed, and drawing the curtains on one side, was aware, from the deep breathing, and the occasional sigh which reached his ears, that the man whom he had been so long in pursuit of was lying before him. His heart had long been full of the desire for vengeance, and his knife was ready in his hand. It wanted but sufficient light to show him where 12* to strike with fatal effect, and the blow would have been given. He had but to feel for the breast of his enemy, and the rest was easy. He was about to do so, when the light in the apartment was suddenly strengthened. He looked up with momentary apprehension. The opposite curtain was drawn aside in the same moment, and he beheld, with terror, what he believed to be the apparition of his long-perished daughter. Certainly, no spectre could have worn a more pallid or awful countenance—no glance from eyes that had once been mortal, could have shone with more supernatural lustre. The light of delirium and fever was there—and the wild, spiritual gleam, which looks out, in fitful spasms, from the hollow sockets of the dying. Their glances met in the same instant, and what a life of mutual wo, and terror, and desolation, did they each convey! A shriek from both was the result of that unlooked-for encounter. The light dropped from the hands of the dying girl, upon the bed, and was extinguished; the dagger fell harmlessly from his, beside the bosom it was meant to stab. Her hollow voice sounded in his ears, and the words she spoke confirmed all his terrors. “My father! Oh! my father!” was the exclamation forced from her by the suddenly recovered memory of the painful past: and as he heard it, he darted away, in headlong flight, heedless of the body of Watson Gray, upon which, in his terrors, he trampled, without a consciousness of having done so. The spectral form of the girl darted after him. He saw her white garments, as he bounded down the stairflights, and the glimpse lent vigour to his limbs. He heard her voice, faint and feeble, like the moaning whisper of the dying breeze in autumn, imploring him to stay, and it sounded more terribly in his ears than the last trumpet. A painful consciousness of having, by his cruelty, driven the poor girl to the desperate deed of self-destruction, haunted his mind; and her appearance seemed to him that of one armed with all the terrors of the avenger. It will not be thought wonderful by those who are at all conversant with the nature of the human intellect, and with those Ithuriel touches that move it to and fro at will, to state that the effect of her father's presence had suddenly restored his daughter to her senses. At least, she knew that it was her father whom she pursued—she knew that he had spurned her from his presence, and present consciousness led her to implore his forgiveness and to die. She knew that the hand of death was upon her, but she desired his forgiveness first. The knowledge of her situation gave her the requisite strength for the pursuit, and before her pathway could be traced, she had followed his into the neighbouring forest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. THE FATHER AND HIS CHILD. Clarkson, with the instinct of the scout, sought shelter in the woods from all pursuit, whether supernatural or human. He fled with the speed of the hunted deer, and had soon left far behind him the fainting form of his shadowy pursuer. But of this he knew nothing. He looked not once after him, upon leaving the house. Buried in the woods, he was still pressing his way forward, when a voice which, at another time, would have been familiar and friendly in his ears, addressed him and summoned him to stop. But, under the prevailing apprehension of his heart, he fancied it the same voice of terror which had risen from the grave to rebuke him, and this conviction increased the earnestness of his flight. A footstep as fleet as his own now joined in the pursuit. He heard the quick tread behind, and finally beside him, and desperate in the feeling that he was overtaken, he turned wildly to confront his pursuer. A hand of flesh and blood was laid upon his shoulder at the same moment, and the voice of our old friend John Bannister reassured him, and reconciled him to delay. “By Jings!” exclaimed the woodman, “if I didn't know you to have the real grit in you, Jake Clarkson, I would think you was getting to be rather timorsome in your old age. What's the matter, man?—what's flung you so?” “Ah, John! Is that you?”—and the frightened man grappled the hand of the new-comer with fingers that were cold and clammy with the kindred terrors of his heart. “I reckon it is. I suppose you thought by this time, that Lord Rawdon and the Black Riders had made a breakfast upon me, keeping a chip of me, here and there, to stay their marching stomachs upon. But, you see, there's more ways than one of slipping a halter, when the horse can borrow a friend's finger to help his teeth. The acorn ain't planted yet that's to make my swinging tree. I'm here, old man, and out of their clutches, I'm thinking, without losing any of my own hide, and bringing with me a very good sample of theirs. As keen a nag, Jake Clarkson, as ever was taken from the Philistines lies in that 'ere bog—a fifty guinea nag.—I've spoiled the Egyptians in my captivity. Come and look at the critter.” “Ah, John, I'm so glad to see you. Stand by me,— and look!” “Stand by you, and look! Why, what's to look upon?—what's to hurt you? What's scared you? The woods was never more quiet. I've been all round the barony, and their guard is half drunk and half asleep in an old log cabin between the stables and the negro houses. They can do no hurt, I tell you.” “Not them, John—you don't think I mind them? But, hear you! I've seen her!” His voice sunk to a hoarse whisper, and he looked behind him, over the path he came, with undiminished terrors. “Her? Who? Who's her?” “Mary! Poor Mary! The child I killed!—The poor child!” “Ha!—She still lives then!” “No! no!—her ghost. Her spirit! It walks! Oh! John Bannister,—'twas a dreadful, dreadful sight. I went to kill Ned Conway. He's lying there, wounded in the house. I've been watching here in the woods, ever since the British went. I went several times into the house but couldn't get a chance at him till to-night. To-night, I got to his room. It was so dark I couldn't see how he lay in the bed; and when I was feeling for him, the curtain drawed up on one side, and then I saw Mary—poor Mary—whiter than the driven snow, all in a sudden blaze of light. Oh! how dreadful white she looked! How awful bright her eyes shone at me. I couldn't stand it; I couldn't look; and when she spoke to me, I felt all over choking. Jist then, it suddenly turned dark, and I run, and when I looked back she was coming after me. She didn't seem to run or walk; she seemed to come with the air; and to fly between the trees—” “What! you didn't see her after you left the house, did you?” “Yes! oh yes? She flew after me into the woods.” The woodman struck his head with his palm, as, readily conceiving the true grounds for Clarkson's terrors, he thought of the wounded and dying girl in a paroxysm of delirium, flying into the rugged forest at midnight. “Stay here, stay awhile, Jake, while I go!” said he. “Don't go—don't leave me!” implored the old man. “It's I that killed her, John, by my cruelty. I driv' her away from the house, and she went mad and drowned herself in the Congaree; and she haunts me for it. She's here near us now, watching for you to go. Don't go, John; don't leave me now. If you do, I'll run to the river. I'll drown myself after her.” Bannister found some difficulty in soothing the superstitious terrors of the old man, but he at length succeeded in doing so in sufficient degree to persuade him to remain where he was, in waiting, till he went forward towards the mansion. “I'll whistle to you the old whistle,” said the woodman, “as I'm coming back. But don't you be scared at any thing you see. I'm sure there's no ghost that ain't a nateral one. I've never known the story of a ghost yet that it didn't turn out to be a curtain in the wind, a white sheet hung out to dry, or mout be—sich things will scare some people—a large moss-beard hanging down upon a green oak's branches. If a man's to be scared by a ghost, Jake Clarkson, I give him up for a scout, or even for a soldier. He won't do for the woods. There's not an owl in an old tree that ain't his master,—there's not a piece of rotten wood shining in the bottom, that ain't a devil ready to run off with him. The squirrel that jumps in the bush, and the lizard that runs upon the dry leaves, is a little sort of `a coming-to-catch-me,' for such a person; and, God help him, if a pine-burr should drop on his head when he ain't thinking. If his heart don't jump out of his mouth, quicker than ever a green frog jumped out of a black snake's hollow, then I'm no man to know any thing about scouting. No, no! Jake Clarkson, t'wont do for you that's been counted a strong man, who didn't fear the devil nor the tories, to be taking fright at a something that's more like a dream than any thing serious. It's nothing but what's nateral that's scared you, I'm thinking, and jist you keep quiet till I go back and see. They can't scare me with their blue lights and burning eyes. My mother was a woman, with the soul of a man, that had the real grit in her. I was only scared once in my life, and then she licked the scare out of me, so complete that that one licking's lasted me agin any scare that ever happened since.” “But my child—my poor child—the child that I killed, John Bannister;” said the father in reproachful accents. “Well, there's something in that, Jake Clarkson, I'm willing to admit. When a man's done a wrong thing, if any thing's right to scare him, it's that. But though you was cross, and too cross, as I told you, to poor Mary, yet it's not reasonable to think you killed her; and I'll lay my life on it, if you saw Mary Clarkson to-night, you saw the real Mary, and no make b'lieve—no ghost! But I'll go and see, and if there's any truth to be got at, trust me to pick it up somewhere along the track. Keep you quiet here, and mind to answer my whistle.” The woodman hurried away, without wailing to answer the inquiries of the unhappy father, whom the words of the former had led to new ideas. The suggestion, thrown out by Bannister, that Mary Clarkson might be yet alive, was intended by the scout to prepare the mind of the former for a probable meeting between himself and his child. He left him consequently in a singular state of impatient agitation, which was far more exhausting to the physical man, than would have been the encounter of a dozen foes in battle; and, with a feebleness which looked like one of the forms of paralysis, and had its effects for a time, the old man sank upon the ground at the foot of a tree, and groaned with the very pain of imbecility. Bannister, meanwhile, took his way back in the direction of the mansion, and as nearly as possible along the route upon which he supposed his companion to have run. His judgment proved correct in this, as in most particulars. He had barely emerged from the thicker woods, and got upon the edge of the immediate enclosure which circumscribed the area of the household, when his eye was caught by a white heap which lay within thirty yards of the woods. He approached it, and found it to be the object of his search. The poor girl was stretched upon the ground immovable. The small degree of strength with which the momentary paroxysm had inspired her, had passed away, and she lay supine;—her eyes opened and watching the woods to which her father had fled—and her hands stretched outwards in the same direction. Death was upon her, but the weight of his hand was not heavy, and his sting did not seem to be felt. A slight moaning sound escaped her lips, but it was rather the utterance of the parting breath than of any sensation of pain which she experienced. John Bannister knelt down beside her. The stout man once more found himself a boy. “This then,” was the thought which filled his brain— “this then, is the sweet little girl whom I once loved so much!” She knew him. A faint smile covered her features, and almost the last effort of her strength, enabled her to point to the woods, and to exclaim— “My father! my father!—There! Bear me to him, John.” The hand fell suddenly, the voice was silent, the lips were closed. A shiver shook the limbs of the strong man. “Mary! Mary!” he called huskily. Her eyes unclosed. She was not dead. There was still life, and there might be time to place her in the arms of her father before it was utterly gone. A noise in the direction of the mansion, and the appearance of lights in the avenue, determined the prompt woodman. He wound his arms tenderly about her, raised her to his bosom, laid her head on his shoulder, and as if she had been a mere infant in his grasp, darted forward into the cover of the woods. The alarm had evidently been given at the mansion, he heard the voices of the household, and the sudden clamours of the half sober and half sleeping soldiery. But he defied pursuit and search, as, bounding off, in a well known route, he soon placed his burden at the foot of her father. “Here, Clarkson, here is your daughter. Here is poor Mary. She was not drowned. She lives, Jake Clarkson, but she has not long to live. She's going fast. Be quick—look at her, and talk softly!” Clarkson bounded to his feet, gazed with convulsive tremors upon the pale, silent form before him, then, with the shriek of a most miserable joy, he clasped her in his arms. Her eyes opened upon him. He held her from him that he might the better meet their gaze. She smiled, threw herself forward upon his breast, and was buried within his embrace. In a wild incoherent speech, of mixed tenderness and reproach, he poured forth the emotions of his heart—the pangs of years—the pleasures of the moment—the chidings of his own cruelty, and her misdeeds. But she answered nothing—she heard nothing. Neither praise nor blame could touch or penetrate the dull, cold ear of death. She was, at length, at rest. “Speak to me, dear Mary. Only tell me that you VOL. II. 13 forgive me all, as John Bannister can tell you I have forgiven you.” “She will never speak again, Jacob. It's all over. She's got rid of the pain, and the trouble, and the vexation of this life; and I reckon she'll have no more in the next; for God knows, jist as well as I, that she's had a great deal more than her share.” “You don't say she's dead?” said Clarkson huskily. “Well, except for the pain of it, she's been dead a long time, Jacob. But she don't hear you, I reckon, and she don't feel your arms, though you hold her so close to you. Give her to me, Jacob, that I may carry her deeper into the bay. The lights from the house are coming close, and they may find us here.” “Let 'em come!—who cares? They won't want her now she's dead?” “No; but they may want us, Jacob.” “Let them want, and let them seek! We're ready! We'll fight, I reckon!” and his fingers were clutched together convulsively as if the weapon were still within their grasp. “Yes, we'll fight,” said Bannister, “but not here, and not till we put her out of the way. 'Twon't be right to fight any body where she is—not in her presence, as I may say.” “True, true,” replied the other faintly, “but I'll carry her, John.” Bannister did not object, but led the way to the thicket, while the father followed with his burden. There, the woodman drew forth his matchbox and struck a light, and the two sat down to survey the pale spiritual features of one who had certainly held a deep place in the affections of both. It was a curious survey. Their place of retreat was one of those dense sombre masses of the forest, where, even in midday, the whole-some daylight never thoroughly came. The demi-obscure alone— “The little glooming light most like a shade,” declared the meridian hour; while at midnight the place was dark as Erebus. The broad circumferences of oaks, the lofty stretch of ever-moaning pines, gathered close and solemnly around as if in secret council; while vines and leaves, massed together in the intervals above, effectually roofed in the spot with a dread cathedral vastness and magnificence. The spot had been freely used before by the outlyers, and more than one comfortable bed of dried leaves might be discovered under the oaks. On one of these the body of the girl was laid. A few paces distant from her feet, in a depression of the earth, John Bannister had gathered his splinters and kindled a little fire, just sufficient to enable them to behold one another, and perhaps make them more than ever feel the deep and gloomy density of the place. The adjuncts of the scene were all calculated to make them feel its sadness. No fitter spot could have been chosen for gloomy thoughts. None, which could more completely harmonize with the pallid presence of the dead. The head of the girl rested in the lap of the father. John Bannister sat behind the old man. A sense of delicacy made him reserved. He did not wish to obtrude at such a moment. Years had elapsed since the father had been persuaded that his child had been lost to him, irrevocably, by death; and this conviction was embittered by the further belief that his own violence had driven her to a desperate end. In that conviction, deep, and keen, and bitter, were the pangs of his soul; —pangs which he could only blunt by the endeavour, hitherto futile, of finding, and inflicting vengeance upon, her betrayer. Dark had been his soul, darker its desires and designs. At length he finds her alive, whom he had fancied he had destroyed. He finds her living, only to see her die. His thoughts may be conjectured, not traced, nor described, as he watched the pale countenance, still beautiful, which lay before him in the immovable ice of death. He watched her long in silence. Not a word was spoken by himself, and John Bannister felt too sincerely, on his own account, for idle and unnecessary remark. But the stifled nature at length broke its bonds. The heart of the father heaved with the accumulating emotions. Deep groans burst from his lips, and a sudden flood of relieving tears gushed from his eyes. Bannister felt easier as he perceived the change. “All's for the best,” said he with a plain homespun effort at consolation. “It's best that she's gone, Jake Clarkson; and you see God spared her jest long enough to bring you together that you might exchange pardon. You was a little rough and she was a little rash, and God, he knows, you've both had mighty bad roughing for it ever since. Poor thing, she's gone to Heaven, that's clear enough to me. I'm not dub'ous about it. She's been a sinner like the best, but if she ha'n't sorry for it from the bottom of her heart, then sinner never was sorry. Poor Mary, if she hadn't looked a little too high, she wouldn't ha' fallen so low. She'd ha' been an honest man's wife; but what's the use to talk of that now. It only makes one's eyes water the more.” “It's good, John. It sort o' softens a man!” “Not too much. But, of a truth, Jake, I once was jist on the point of axing you and Mary! I was; for I did love her, as I ha'n't seen woman to love from that day to this;—and but for that—” “That bloody villain! That thief—that murderer! Ha! Ha!—But I will have him yet, John Bannister! I was a fool to be frightened away, jist when I had my hand at his throat, and nothing to stop me. There he lay, still and ready. Ho! John, jist there! I think I see him now! Stretched out, his eyes shut, his breast open, and nobody looking on—” “Stop, Jacob Clarkson, God was a-looking on all the time—and Mary Clarkson was a-looking on, and what sent her there jest at that moment? What but God! And what did he send her there for, but to stop you from doing a wrong thing. Look you, Jake Clarkson, you know I don't often stop when fighting's going on. I'm as quick to kill as the quickest dragoon in all Tarleton's squad. That is, I'm quick to kill when it's the time for killing. But there's a time for all things, and I ain't quick to kill the man that's a-sleeping, and him too, so cut up already, that it's a chance if he ain't got enough to bury him. I'm a-thinking, Jacob Clarkson, that God has jest given you a good warning, that you must do your killing in fair fight, and not by stealing to a man's bedside when he's sleeping, and he pretty well chopped up already; I reckon you'll be the man to kill Ned Conway yet, if what he's got don't finish him; and if it does, you're only to thank God for taking an ugly business off your hands. When I look upon Mary, there, it puts me out of the idea of killing altogether. I'm sure I wish peace was everywhere. Lord save us from a time like this, when a poor child like that, runs into the way of hard blows and bloody weapons. It makes my heart sort o' wither up within me only to think of it.” But Clarkson was not much impressed by the grave opinions of his companion. He had always respected the straightforward character and manly judgment of the woodman; and there was something very plausible to the superstitious mind, in the case presented at the outset of the woodman's speech. “Sure enough! sure enough!” said the old man;— “How could she come, jest at the moment I was going to kill him, if God didn't mean that I shouldn't do it jest then. But if he gets well again, John Bannister—” “Kill him then—I'm cl'ar for that! I'll kill him myself then, if nobody comes before me with a better right. You're got a sort of claim to the preference.” We need not pursue the conference. One question which went to the very heart of John Bannister, and which he evaded, was uttered by the father, as in passing his hands through the unbound portions of her hair, he felt them clammy with her blood. The revelation of her physical injuries was new to him. “Oh, God, John Bannister! she bleeds! Her head is hurt. Here! jest here! I didn't mind the bandage before. She didn't die a nateral death. The cruel villain has killed her. He's got tired of her and killed her.” 13* “Oh, no! no! Jacob!” exclaimed the other, with an agitation of voice and manner which betrayed his secret pangs. “No, I reckon not! He's not able to hurt any body. I reckon—I'm sure—she got hurt by accident. I'll answer for it, the man that struck Mary Clarkson, would have sooner cut his right hand off than ha' done such a thing. 'Twas accident, I'm sure 'twas accident!”—and with these words the poor fellow went aside among the trees and wept like a child as he thought over the cruel haste of his own fierce spirit and too heavy hand. “God forgive me, for not speaking out the truth, which is a sort of lie-telling after all. But how could I tell Jake Clarkson that 'twas the hand of John Bannister that shed the blood of his child? It's woful enough to feel it.” To bury the dead from his sight became the last duty of the father. John Bannister was for carrying the body to the family vault of the Middleton's and laying it there by dawn of day. But to this Clarkson instantly dissented. “No;” said he, “the Middletons are great people, and the Clarksons are poor and mean. We never mixed in life, and there's no reason we should mix in death.” “But you don't know Miss Flora, Jacob Clarkson.” “I don't want to know.” “She's so good. She'd be glad, I'm sure, if we was to put her there. She's been tending poor Mary as if she was her own sister.” “I thank her. I believe she's good as you say, John. But, somebody might come after her, and shut me out of the vault when they please. They wouldn't like me to go there to see Mary when I wish, and wouldn't let 'em put me beside her. No! no! we'll put her in the ground beside the river. I know a place for her already, and there's room for me. She was born by the Congaree, and she'll sleep sweetly beside it. If you live after me, John, put me there with her. It's a little smooth hill that always looks fresh with grass, as if God smiled upon the spot and a good angel lighted there in the night-time. Go, John, and try and find a shovel in the fields somewhere. We've got no coffin, but we'll wrap the child up in pine bark and moss, and she won't feel it any colder. Go, and let me sit down with her by ourselves. It's a long time, you know, since I talked with her, and then I talked cross and harsh. I'll say nothing to vex her now. Go, get the shovel, if you can, and when you come back, we'll take her, and I'll show you where to dig. By that time we'll have day to help us.” Bannister departed without a word, and left the father with his dead. We will not intrude upon his sorrows; but, when the whole history of the humble pair is considered, no sight could be more mournful than to behold the two—there, in that lonely and darksome maze of forest,—at midnight,—the flickering fire-light cast upon the pallid features, almost transparent, of the fair, dead girl, while the father looked on, and talked, and wept, as if his tears could be seen, and his excuses and self-reproaches heard, by the poor child that had loved so warmly, and had been so hardly dealt with by all whom she had ever loved. Conway had ruined her peace and happiness; her father had driven her from her home; and he, who had never wilfully meant, or said, her wrong, had inflicted the fatal blow which had deprived her of life—perhaps, the stroke of mercy and relief to a crushed and wounded spirit such as hers! Truly, there was the hand of fate in this. The fate that will surely follow the sad lapses of the wilful heart! Hers was rather weak than wilful; but weakness is more commonly the cause of vice than wilfulness; and firmness is one of those moral lessons without which there is little virtue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. AN INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE TWO SCOUTS. Meanwhile, the alarm had been given at Briar Park, and the whole house was in commotion. Watson Gray was the first to stumble up, and into consciousness, upon the flight of Mary Clarkson; simply because he had been fortunate enough to feel the full force of the flying footsteps of her father. But several moments had elapsed after her departure, before the discovery of the fact was made, and the pursuit, which was then offered, appears to have taken a wrong direction. Certainly, they did not find the place of her concealment, nor the traces of her flight. Yet no pains were spared to do so. The circumstances were mysterious and exciting;—to Flora Middleton, particularly so. She reproached herself, though, certainly without justice, for having left the poor girl in the custody of a drowsy servant; and her self-childings were by no means lessened when the minds of all at the barony appeared to settle down in the belief that, in her delirium, the poor girl had wandered off to the river banks and cast herself into its waters. Thus, a second time, was the innocent Congaree made to bear the reproach of participating in, and promoting, the destruction of the same unhappy life. In the chamber of the outlaw, the feelings, if less solemn and tender, were surely not less grave and serious. To Watson Gray, the mere death of the poor victim of his confederate, would have been of very small importance. Perhaps, indeed, he would have felt that it was a benefit—a large step gained towards the more perfect freedom of his principal. But there were some circumstances that compelled his apprehensions. Who had been in the chamber? What heavy feet were they that trampled upon him, and why was that strange and formidable knife resting beside the person of the outlaw? That somebody, from the apartment of Mary Clarkson, had been in that of Edward Conway, was soon apparent from the discovery of the little lamp which the former had carried, and which had fallen from her hands upon the couch of the latter, in the moment when she saw her father's face. This had been recognised by the servants, and the fact made known in the confusion of the search. But, though Gray felt certain that Mary had been in the room, he was equally certain that there had been another also. It was possible that, in her delirium, the poor girl may have carried the knife as well as the light, and that she may have meditated the death of her betrayer—all that was natural enough; but Gray felt sure that a heavier foot had trampled upon his neck and breast. Naturally of a suspicious temper, his fears were confirmed, when, issuing from the house at the first alarm, he found his guards either withdrawn, or straggling towards their posts in almost helpless inebriety. Their condition led him to recall the story of the surgeon. The description which the latter gave of the stranger who had penetrated to the breakfast-room—his garments of blue homespun, and the huge knife which he carried,—tended, in considerable degree, to enlighten him on the subject. He called the attention of the surgeon to the knife which had been found on the bed, and the latter so far confirmed the identity of that with the one which the supposed ghost was seen to carry, as to say that the one was equally large of size with the other; but the former was incomparably more bright. He handled, with exceeding caution, the dark and dingy instrument, and re-delivered it, with fingers that seemed glad to be relieved from the unpleasant contact. Seeing the surprise of the scout at such seeming apprehension, he began a long discourse about contagion, infection, and the instinctive dread which he had of all cutaneous disorders; to all of which Gray turned a deaf ear, and a wandering eye. The outlaw had been wakened by the unavoidable noise of the search, and had heard with some surprise and interest the circumstances which were detailed to him by Gray. “How strange!” he exclaimed. “Do you know I had the sweetest sleep, in which I dreamed that Mary and myself were walking over the old rice-dam on the Santee, and I began to feel for her just as I felt then, when I first knew her, and she seemed twice as lovely, and was twice as intelligent. How strange!” Gray had judiciously suppressed some of the circumstances connected with the events of the evening. He had concealed the knife entirely, and forbore stating to him, as well as to every body else, every thing which related to the supposed intrusion of some stranger into the household. “You have found her, Gray?” said the outlaw, when the former returned from the search. “No! she is nowhere in the grounds.” “Indeed! could she have wandered to the river?” “That is what they all think.” “But you?” “I know not what to think.” “Why should you not think with them?” “I should, but she did not seem to me to have strength enough for that. The river is a mile off; and she was evidently sinking fast when I saw her this evening.” “Where then do you think her?” “Somewhere at hand. In some outhouse, or some hole or corner,—or, possibly, in some ditch, or close nest of bushes, where we can't find her by night.” “Good God! and she has probably perished there, and thus!” Gray was silent, and the outlaw felt the returning pangs of that remorse which most probably would have remained unfelt, except during the present period of his own inability. “Poor, poor Mary. I would, Gray, that I could live over some things—some moments, of the past!” “Do not let it afflict you so much. It can't be helped, and these things are common enough!” “Yes, yes! But such a catastrophe! You have been looking for her?” “Yes, for the last two hours.” “But you will go again. You must, Gray!” “With the daylight, I intend to do so.” “That's well. See to her for God's sake, Gray, and if she lives, let her last moments be easy. If all's over, see her carefully buried.. It's an ugly business. Would I were free of that! I know not any blood that I would sooner wish to wash from my hands than hers.” “That should be the wish of Clarence Conway, not yours;” said Gray, taking the literal sense of the outlaw's expression. “Ah, Gray, the blow, the mere blow, is a small matter. If I were free from the rest, I think nothing more would trouble me. The last drop ran the cup over, but who filled it to the brim? who drugged it with misery? who made the poor wretch drink it, persuading her that it was sweet and pure? Ah, Gray, I fear I have been a bad fellow, and if there were another world hereafter—a world of punishments and rewards!”— “Your situation would be then changed, perhaps;” was the brutal sneer of Gray, “and every privilege which you had in this life, would then be given up to her. Perhaps, you'd better sleep, captain; sickness and want of sleep are not good helps to a reasonable way of thinking.” “Gray, I suspect you're a worse fellow than myself,” responded the outlaw with a laugh. “Ten to one the women have more to complain of at your hands than they ever had at mine.” “I don't know. Perhaps. But I think not. The little I know of them makes me fancy that they're a sort of plaything for grown people. As long as they amuse, well and good, and when they cease to do so, the sooner you get rid of them the better. When I was a young man, I thought differently. That is, I didn't think at all. I had a faith in love. I had a similar faith in sweetmeats and sugar-plums. I liked girls and confectionary; and—perhaps you never knew the fact before—I married one young woman, not very much unlike your Mary Clarkson.” “The devil you did!” exclaimed the outlaw. “The devil I did marry!” returned the other gravely. “You speak the very words of truth and soberness. She proved worse than a devil to me. I trusted her like a fool as I was, and she abused me. She ran off with my best horse, in company with an Indian trader, whom I took into my cabin, fed and physicked. He seized the first opportunity, after he got well, to empty my house, and relieve it of some of its troubles. But I didn't see the matter in it's true light. I wasn't thankful! I gave chase, and got my horse back—that was every thing, perhaps, just after they had left Augusta.” “And you let the woman go, eh?” “I left her with him, where I found them, and they liked the spot so well, that I think any curious body that would seek, might find them there to this day. I have some reason to believe that she has been more quiet with him than she ever was with me. I don't believe they ever quarrelled, and when she was my wife we were at it constantly.” “You're a famous fellow, Gray!” exclaimed the outlaw, as he listened to a narrative of crime which was only remarkable, perhaps, from the coolness with which the chief actor related it.” “No, captain, not famous. To be famous is about the last thing that I desire; and I'm thinking, you don't much care about it. But you'd better sleep now. Take all the rest you can, and don't mind any thing you hear. You'll want all your strength and sense, as soon as you can get it, if you wish to get what you aim at.” “No doubt,—I'll do as you counsel. But see after the poor girl by daylight.” “Yes, yes!—we'll take all the care that's needful;” was the response. To stifle the remorse of his superior, Gray had taken a way of his own, and one that was most successful. The cold sneer is, of all other modes, the most effectual in influencing the mind which does not receive its laws from well-grounded principles. How many good purposes have been parried by a sneer! How many clever minds have faltered in a noble aim by the sarcasm of the witling and the worldling! How difficult is it for the young to withstand the curling lip, and the malignant half smile of the audacious and the vain. Gray knew his man, and, in his narration, he had probably shown a degree of contumelious indifference to the character of woman, and the ties of love, which he did not altogether feel. It served his turn, and this was all that he desired of any agent at any time. He turned from gazing on the outlaw, with such a smile as showed, however he might be disposed to toil in his behalf, he was still able to perceive, and to despise, what seemed to him to be the weaknesses of the latter. Leaving the chamber, he descended to the area in front of the dwelling, and drew together, without noise, the file of soldiers that had been left with him by Rawdon. These were now tolerably sobered, and having taken pains to see that their arms were in good condition, for it may be said here that the smallest part of Gray's purpose and care was to find the girl whom it was his avowed object to seek,—he led them forth into the adjoining thicket about an hour before the dawn of day. Of the reputation of Gray as a woodsman we have been already more than once informed, and the suspicions which he entertained were such as to make him address all his capacity to the contemplated search. His little squad were cautioned, with respect to every movement; and divided into three parties of four men each, were sent forward to certain points, with the view to a corresponding advance of all, at the same moment, upon such portions of the woods as seemed most likely to harbour an enemy. Spreading themselves so as to cover the greatest extent of surface, yet not be so remote from each other as to prevent co-operation, they went forward under the circumspect conduct of their leader, with sure steps, and eyes that left no suspicious spot unexamined on their route. The day was just begun. The sun rising through the dim vapoury haze that usually hangs about him at the beginning of his pathway in early summer, fell with faint beauty upon a gentle headland that jutted VOL. II. 14 out upon the Congaree, and compelled its currents to turn aside from the direct route, making a sweep around it, most like the curve of a crescent. Some thirty steps in the back ground was a clump of massive trees, the principal of which were oak and hickory. They grew around one eminent pine that stood, alone, of all its species, as it was alone in its height and majesty. At the foot of this tree, and under the cathedral shelter of the oaks, John Bannister was busy in throwing out the earth for the spot chosen by Clarkson for his daughter's grave. The father sat at a little distance in the back ground, his child's head lying in his lap. The labours of Bannister had been severe, and he would not suffer the old man to assist him. The earth was rigid, and the innumerable roots of the contiguous trees traversed, in every direction, the spot chosen for the grave. Fortunately the stout woodsman had secured an axe as well as a shovel, and the vigour of his arm at length succeeded in the necessary excavation. To remedy, as far as he might, the want of a coffin, the worthy fellow had stripped the rails from the neighbouring fences, and he now proceeded to line, with them, the bottom and sides of the grave. These were in turn lined with pine bark and green moss, and the couch of death was spread with as much care and tenderness, under the cheerless circumstances, as if wealth had brought its best offerings, and labour had yielded its most ingenious toils in compliance with the requisitions of worldly vanity. Bannister was yet in the grave making these dispositions, when Watson Gray, with his soldiers, advanced upon the party. To old Clarkson the task had been assigned of keeping watch. It was physically impossible that Bannister should do so while deep buried and toiling in the earth. The old man was too much absorbed in contemplating the pale features of his child, and too full of the strife within his heart, to heed the dangers from without; and so cautious had been the approach of Gray and his party, that they were upon the sufferer before he could rise from his feet or make the slightest effort to relieve himself from his burthen. It was fortunate for Bannister that, being in the grave and stooping at the time, he was below the surface of the earth, and remained unseen at the time when Clarkson was taken. But, hearing strange voices, he immediately conjectured the approach of enemies, and cautiously peering above the grave, beheld at a glance the danger which threatened him. He saw Watson Gray, conspicuous, and standing directly above the person of Clarkson, whose daughter's head still lay in his lap. One of his hands was pressed upon her bosom, as if he felt some apprehension that she would be taken from him. On either hand of Gray he beheld a group of soldiers, and a glance, still further, to the right and left, showed that they were so placed as to present themselves on every side between him and the forest. His flight seemed entirely cut off. But the coolness and courage of the woodman did not leave him in the emergency. He had already resolved upon his course, and rising rapidly to the surface, he became visible to his enemies. The voice of Watson Gray was heard at the same instant, calling to him to surrender. “Good quarter, Supple Jack!—be quiet and take it. You can't get off. You're surrounded.” The tone of exultation in which the rival scout addressed him, made it a point of honour with Bannister to reject his offer, even if he had had no reason to suppose that the assurance of safety meant nothing. He well knew, in those days, what the value of such an assurance was; for Tarleton, Rawdon, and Cornwallis, had long since shown themselves singularly reckless of all pledges made to the poor bodies who were out in the rebellion of '76. “Make terms when you've got me, Watson Gray;” was the scornful answer of the scout. “The only quarters I ax for is my own, and I'll save them when I've got 'em.” “Run, and I'll shoot!” cried Gray threateningly. “Look, my men are all round you.” “I reckon then I'll find 'em in the bottom of the Congaree;” was the fearless answer, as the scout leapt for the river bank with the speed of an antelope. “Shoot!” cried Gray—“Shoot him as he runs! Fire! Fire!” The vollies rang on every side, but the fugitive remained erect. He had reached the river bank. He seemed unhurt. His enemies pressed forward in pursuit; and clapping his open palms together above his head, he plunged boldly into the stream, and disappeared from sight. Bannister could swim like an otter, and with head under water almost as long. But once he rose to breathe, and his enemies, who waited for his re-appearance with muskets cocked, now threw away their fire in the haste with which they strove to take advantage of his rising. When he next became visible, he was on the opposite shore, and bade them defiance. A bitter laugh answered to their shout as he turned away slowly and reluctantly, and disappeared in the distant thickets. Gray had lost his prey a second time, and he turned, with no good humour, to the prisoner with whom he had been more successful. “Who are you—what's your name?” “Jacob Clarkson!” “Ha! you are then the father of this girl?” “Yes!” was the sad reply of the old man, as his head sank upon his breast. “Do you know this knife?” demanded Gray, showing the knife which had been found at the bedside of Morton. “It is mine.” “Where did you lose, or leave it.” “I know not. I dropped it somewhere last night.” “Where—at the house of Mrs. Middleton?” “It may be!—I was there!” “You were in the chamber of Captain Morton!” “Not that I know on,” was the reply. “Beware! You cannot deceive me. You stood beside his bed. You went there to murder him. Confess the truth:—did you not?” “No!” cried the old man, starting to his feet. “I did go there to murder a man, but God forbid it. I couldn't, though he was lying there before me. She come between. She made me stop, or I'd ha' killed him in another moment. But it was Edward Conway that I would have killed. I know nothing about Captain Morton.” “Ha! I see it. Hither, Sergeant Bozman. Tie this fellow's hands behind him.” “Hands off!” cried the old man, with a sudden show of fight—“Hands off, I tell you! I must first put her in the ground.” “Give yourself no trouble about that. We'll see it done;” said Gray. “I must see it too;” said the old man resolutely. The resolution he expressed would have been idle enough had Gray been disposed to enforce his wishes; but a few moments' reflection induced him, as no evil consequence could possibly ensue from the indulgence, to yield in this respect to the prisoner. “The old rascal!” he exclaimed—“Let him stay. It's perhaps only natural that he should wish to see it; and as they have got the grave ready, put her in at once.” “Stay!” said the father, as they were about to lift the body. “Stay!—only for a minute!” and while the soldiers, more indulgent perhaps than their leader, gave back at his solicitation, the father sank to the ground beside her, and the tones of his muttered farewell, mingled with his prayer, though undistinguishable, were yet audible to the bystanders. “Now, I'm ready;” said he, rising to his feet. “Lay her down, and you may tie me as soon after as you please.” The burial was shortly over. No other prayer was said. Old Clarkson watched the sullen ceremonial to its completion, and was finally, without struggle—or sign of discontent, borne away a prisoner by his inflexible captor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">14* CHAPTER XIII. GLIMPSES OF COMING EVENTS. The outlaw did not hear of Mary Clarkson's death without some emotion; but the duration of his remorse was short. He soon shook himself free from its annoyances, and in a week more it was forgotten. Of the arrest of old Clarkson, his own previous danger from the hands of the latter, and several other details, connected with his proceedings, Watson Gray did not suffer his principal to know any thing. His main object was to get his patient up and on his legs again, foreseeing that a time was approaching, when a sick bed could be no security for either of them in a region to be so shortly winnowed with the sword of an enemy. His scouts occasionally arrived bringing him reports of the condition of the country: of the prospects of Rawdon's army, and of the several smaller bodies under Greene, Sumter, Marion, and Pickens. These reports counselled him to make all speed. He did not press the outlaw with these facts for fear that their tendency might be to increase his anxiety, and discourage rather than promote his cure. But his own anxious efforts were given, without stint or interruption, to every measure by which his improvement might be effected. No nurse could have been more devoted, no physician more circumspect, no guardian more watchful. The late attempts of Clarkson had given him a mean opinion of the regulars which had been left to take care of the barony, and to watch them was the most irksome, yet necessary duty, which he had undertaken. But he went to his tasks cheerfully, and, with this spirit, a strong man may almost achieve any thing. The tidings which were sometimes permitted to reach the ears of Flora Middleton, were of no inconsiderable interest to that maiden. She heard frequently of Clarence Conway, and always favourably. Now he was harassing the tories on the upper Saluda, and now driving them before him into the meshes of Pickens among the Unacaya mountains. The last tidings in respect to him which reached her ears, were also made known to Watson Gray by one of his runners; and were of more particular importance to both of them than they were then fully aware of. It was reported that a severe fight had taken place between Conway's Blues and the Black Riders. The latter were beguiled into an ambush which Conway had devised, after the ordinary Indian fashion, in the form of a triangle, in which twenty-three of the Black Riders were sabred, and the rest dispersed. Gray did not greatly regret this disaster. He was soon to be free of the connection, and, perhaps, he conceived this mode of getting rid of them, to be quite as eligible, and, certainly, as effectual as any other. “That fellow, Stockton, with his sly second, Darcy, are the only chaps that might trouble us. They suspect us, they know something, perhaps, and if Conway has only cut them up along with the twenty-three, we shall count him as good an ally as the best.” Such was his only reflection as he communicated this news to the outlaw. “Ay,” replied the latter, “but why was there no lucky bullet to reward the conquerer. That hopeful brother of mine seems to own a charmed life, indeed. I know that he goes into the thick of it always, yet he seldom gets even his whiskers singed. The devil takes care of him surely. He has proper friends in that quarter.” “We needn't care for him, Captain, so long as Rawdon lies between us. If you were only up, now, and able, we could whip off the lady, and every hair of a negro, and take shipping before they could say Jack Robinson, or guess what we are driving at.” “Ay, if I were only up!” groaned the outlaw writhing upon his couch. “But that `if' is the all and every thing.” “But you are better. You are much stronger. I think this last week has done wonders for you; and, but for the weakness, and the gashes in your face—” The speaker paused without finishing the sentence. “Very comely, no doubt: they will strike a lady favourably, eh? Do you not think they improve my looks wonderfully?” There was something of bitterness in the affected indifference with which the outlaw made this comment. The other made no reply, and did not appear to heed the tone of complaint. “Give me the glass, Gray,” continued the outlaw. He was obeyed; the mirror was put into his hands, and he subjected his visage to a long scrutiny. “Nothing so shocking after all. My mouth is something enlarged, but that will improve my musical ability. I shall be the better able to sing `Hail Britannia,' in his Majesty's Island of Jamaica, or the `Still vex'd Bernadotte.' Besides, for the look of the thing, what need I care? I shall be no longer in the market; and my wife is in duty bound to think me comely. Eh, what say you, Gray?” “Yes, surely; and Miss Middleton don't seem to be one to care much about a body's looks.” “Don't you believe it, Gray. She's a woman like the rest; and they go by looks. Smooth flowing locks, big, bushy whiskers, and a sharp, death-defying face will do much among a regiment of women. I've known many a sensible woman—sensible I mean for the sex—seek a fool simply because he was an ass so monstrous as to be unapproachable by any other, and was, therefore, the fashion. The ugliness, in such a case, makes no difference. But this is the only exception. You must be monstrous or you must be handsome; and the more monstrous—the more likely to be successful. There is something in a title too, I grant you. Now were I a lord or baronet—a count or marquis, you might slash my cheeks with half a score more of such gashes as these, and they would, in no degree, affect my fortune with the fair. In that is my hope. I must buy a title as soon as I have my prize, and then all objections will disappear. Still, I could have wished that that d—d spiteful brother of mine had subjected me to no such necessity. He might have slashed hip or thigh, and gratified himself quite as much in those quarters.” “Let us carry out the project, and you have your revenge!” “Ay, and there's consolation in that for more points than these. But hear you nothing yet from below? What from Pete? If the boats fail us at the proper time, we shall be in an ugly fix.” “They will not fail us. Every thing now depends on you. If you can stir when the time comes—” “Stir—I can stir now. I mean to try my limbs before the week's out, for, as the fair Flora forbears to come and see me, I shall certainly make an effort to go and see her. Has the poison touched, think you? Does she feel it—does she believe it?” The outlaw referred to the slander which Gray had insinuated against Clarence Conway. “No doubt. She's so proud that there's no telling where it hurts her, and she'll never tell herself; but I know from the flashing of her eye, after I said what I did about Colonel Conway and Mary Clarkson, that she believed and felt it. Besides, captain, I must tell you, that she's asked after you more kindly and more frequently of late. She always asks.” “Ha! that's a good sign; well?” “I said you were more unhappy than sick. That you'd get over the body hurts, I had no doubt. But then, I told her what an awful thing to fight with one's brother, and how much you felt that!” “Ha! Well, and then?” “She sighed, but said nothing more, and soon after went out of the room.” “Good seed, well planted. I shall cultivate the plant carefully. I fancy I can manage that.” “Psha!—Here's the surgeon;” said Gray, interrupting him with a whisper, as Mr. Hillhouse appeared at the entrance. The surgeon had forgotten or forgiven the slight to which his patient had previously subjected him. He was not a person to remember any circumstance which might be likely to disparage him in his own esteem. Besides, his head was now running upon a project which made him disposed to smile upon all mankind. We will allow him to explain his own fancies. “Mr. Conway, good morning. I trust you feel better. Nay, I see you do. Your eyes show it, and your colour is strengthening. Suffer me to examine your pulse.” “I feel better, sir, stronger. I trust to get fairly out of my lair in a week. I shall make a desperate attempt to do so.” “You are better, sir, but do nothing rashly. A week may produce great results. There are but seven days in a week, Mr. Conway—but a poor seven days—yet how many events—how many fates—how many deeds of good and evil, lie in that space of time. Ah! I have reason to say this from the bottom of my heart. A week here, sir, at this barony, has changed the whole aspect of my life.” A sigh followed this speech. “Indeed! And how so, pray!” “You see in me, Mr. Conway, a man who has lived a great deal in a short space of time. In the language of the ancient poet,—Ovid, it is—my life is to be told by events, and not by lingering years. It is a book crowded. I have passed through all the vicissitudes of a long life in Europe, India, and America; I have ate and drank, marched and fought, played the man of pleasure and the man of business,—stood in my friend's grave, and often at the edge of my own;—saved life, taken life; and practised, suffered and enjoyed, all things, and thoughts, and performances, which are usually only to be known to various men in various situations. But, sir, one humbling accident,—the trying event, which usually occurs to every other man at an early period of his life, has hitherto, by the special favour of a benign providence, been withheld from mine!” “Ah, sir, and what may that be?” demanded the outlaw. “I have never loved, sir, till now. Never known the pang, and the prostration; the hope and the fear; the doubt and the desire; 'till the fates cast me upon the banks of the Congaree! Melancholy conviction! that he who has survived the charms of Europe and India— who has passed through the temptations of the noble and the beautiful, the wealthy and the vain, of those beguiling regions,—should here be overtaken and overcome by the enemy in the wild woods of America.” “Indeed! It is indeed a most dreadful catastrophe! Gray, hand the doctor a chair, a glass of water, and if you have any Jamaica,—” “No, no!—I thank you, no!—I will take the chair only.” “And pray, sir,” said the outlaw with a mock interest in the subject—“when did you suffer from the first attack, and who do you suspect of bewitching you?” “Suspect of bewitching me!—a good phrase that!— I like it. My suspicions, sir, as well as yours, should naturally be strong that I am the victim of a sort of witchcraft; for, how else should a man fall so suddenly and strangely in a strange land, who has stood unshaken so long.” “Very true! a very natural reflection, sir. But you have not said who you suspect of this cruel business.” “Ah, sir, who but the fair damsel of this very house. What woman is there like unto her in all the land.” “Ha! Is it possible!” “Possible!—why not possible?” demanded the surgeon. “Is she not young, and fair, and rich in goods and chattels, and who so likely to practise sorcery?” “True, true!—but doctor, are you aware that you are not the only victim? She has practised with perhaps greater success on others.” “Indeed! Tell me, I pray you, sir!” “Nay, I can only speak from hearsay. My friend here, Mr. Gray, can tell you more on the subject. The story goes,—but I must refer you to him. Gray, take a ramble with Mr. Hillhouse, and see if you cannot match his witchcraft case with one or more, much worse, if possible, than his own. Let him see that he does not lack for sympathy.” Gray took the hint, and the surgeon readily accepted the invitation to a walk, in which the former continued to give to his companion a very succinct account of the duel between the brothers, and the engagement supposed to be existing between Clarence and Flora. The artful confederate of the outlaw, taking it for granted that a person so supremely vain and silly as the surgeon, might be made to believe any thing, and could scarcely keep secret that which he heard, adapted his material in such a way as to make it appear that the fight between the brothers arose in consequence of the cruel treatment which Mary Clarkson had received at the hands of the younger. A purely magnanimous motive led the elder brother into the difficulty. “Now, Mr. Conway, your patient, as soon as he heard that Colonel Conway was courting Miss Middleton, pursued him to reproach him for his breach of promise to the poor creature. The proud stomach of Colonel Conway couldn't bear that, and he drew upon Mr. Conway and wounded him in the face before he could put himself in preparation. The poor girl who had been following the colonel, everywhere, in boy's clothes, ran between them, and got her death, there's no telling by whose hands. And so the case stands, at present. Mr. Conway, your patient, of course wouldn't speak against his brother; and I s'pose, the marriage will go on between him and Miss Flora, unless—she may have changed her mind since you're come to the barony.” “Ah! ha!” said the surgeon. “You've enlightened me very much, Mr. Watson Gray. I'm greatly your debtor. You are a man of sense. I thank you, sir,— I thank you very much. Suppose we return to the mansion. I am anxious to change these garments.” “Change them, sir! What, your dress?” The blunt mind of Gray couldn't perceive the association of ideas taking place in the brain of his companion. “Yes, I wish to put on a dove-coloured suit. The dress which I now wear, does not suit the day, the circumstances, nor my present feelings.” “What, sir!” demanded Gray in feigned astonishment. “Have you got a change for every day in the week? I have but one change in all.” The surgeon turned upon the speaker with a look which plainly said, “Impertinent fellow, to venture upon such an offensive comparison.” He contented himself, however, with remarking,— “The wants of men, my good friend, differ according to the rural natures, moods, and changes of mind by which they are governed. I have no doubt that two suits will be ample enough for your purposes; but for me, I have always striven to make my costume correspond with the particular feeling which affects me. My feelings are classed under different heads and orders, which have their subdivisions in turn, according to the degree, quality and strength of my several sensibilities. Of the first orders, there are two—pleasure and pain; under these heads come cheerfulness and sadness; these in turn have their degrees and qualities—under the first is hope, under the second, fear,—then there are doubts and desires which follow these; and after all, I have omitted many still nicer divisions which I doubt if you could well appreciate. I have not spoken of love and hate—nor indeed, of any of the more positive and emphatic passions, but for all of which I have been long provided with a suitable colour and costume.” “You don't mean to say that you're got a change suitable for every one of these?” said the woodman with some astonishment. “You inquire, Mr. Gray, with the tone of one who will not be likely to believe any assurance. Oblige me by witnessing for yourself. I had arranged to examine my wardrobe this very noon, as a sort of mental occupation, with which I relieve the tedium of repose, and bad weather, and unpleasant anticipations. Do me the favour to assist me in this examination. We may probably gather from it some useful lessons, and I will endeavour VOL. II. 15 to explain, what's at present very imperfectly understood, the singular propriety of my principles. You shall be able, when you have heard my explanation, to know from the dress I wear, what particular condition I am in that day. A man's costume, if properly classed, is a sort of pulse for his temper. This morning, when I rose, under the influence of one set of moods, I put on a meditation costume. I am in a brown dress you see. That shows that when I put it on, I was in what is vulgarly called a `brown study.' Circumstances, the grounds of which you cannot, perhaps, conjecture, prompt me to go back and change it for one of a dove colour. You may perhaps comprehend the meaning of this hereafter.” “I reckon it's something about love, that dove colour,” said Gray bluntly. “Dove and love, always go together.” “Ah, you are quick. You are naturally an intelligent person, I suspect. You will comprehend sooner than I expected, but come and see—come and see.” “This fool will do us excellent service,” said the outlaw, when, at his return, Watson Gray recounted the events of the interview. “He will go to Flora Middleton in his dove-coloured small-clothes, and find some way of letting her know what a scamp Clarence Conway is, and what a martyr I have been to the cause of innocence betrayed. You did not let him guess that I had a hankering after Flora myself.” “Surely not: I just let him know enough of the truth to lie about. He'll do mischief with it.” “And mischief is our good—it works for us. Let him kill Clarence Conway in her esteem, and he, certainly, is not the thing to be afraid of. But did you really count his breeches?” “No, God help me!—I shook myself free from him as soon as I could. I'd as soon pry among the petticoats of my grandmothers. But he had an enormous quantity. I reckon he's used up all his pay, ever since he began, in this sort of childishness.” The conjectures of the outlaw, as respects the course of the exquisite, were soon realized. But a few days had elapsed when he availed himself of an opportunity to pursue Flora as he saw her taking her way through the grounds in the direction of the river. His toilet, however, was not completed when he caught a glimpse of her person through the window; and the task of completing it, always one of considerable pains and duration, enabled her to get considerably the start of him. She had passed the sentinels, who were sauntering at their stations, and had reached the lonely vault where her ancestors reposed. The solemn shadows of the wood by which it was encircled pleased her fancy; and the united murmurs of the pine tops and the waters of the Congaree, as they hurried on at a little distance below, beguiled her thoughts into the sweet abodes of youthful meditation. Flora Middleton was, as we have endeavoured to show, a maiden of deeper character and firmer qualities, than usually distinguish her age; perhaps, indeed, these characteristics are not often possessed in equal degree among her sex. Firmness of character usually implies a large share of cheerfulness and elasticity; and these also were attributes of her mind. Her life, so far, had been free from much trial. She had seldom been doomed to suffering. Now, for almost the first time, the shadows of the heart gathered around her, making her feet to falter, and bringing the tears into her eyes. The supposed infidelity of Clarence Conway had touched her deeply—more deeply than even she had at first apprehended. When she first heard the accusation against him, and saw the wretched condition of the poor girl whom she believed to be destroyed by his profligacy, she said, in the fervour of virtuous indignation which prevailed in her mind,—“I will shake him off for ever, and forget that I ever knew him!” But the resolution was more easily taken than kept. Each subsequent hour had increased the difficulties of such a resolution; and in the seeming death of her hopes alone, she discovered how entirely her heart had found its life in their preservation. When she believed the object of her attachment to be worthless,—then, and not till then, did she feel how miserable its loss would make her heart. Perhaps, but for the very firmness of character of which we have spoken, she would neither have made, nor maintained, such a resolution. How many are the dependent hearts among her sex, who doubt, distrust, fear, falter,—and—accept! Who dare not reject the unworthy because they cannot forbear to love. Flora Middleton felt the pain of the sacrifice the more deeply, in consequence of the conviction which her principles forced upon her that it must yet be made. Could she have faltered with her pride and her principles, she would not have found the pain so keen. But she was resolute. “No! no!” she murmured to herself, as all the arguments of love were arranged before her by the affections—“No! no! though it kills me to say the words, yet I will say them. Clarence Conway, we are sundered,—separated, for ever! I might have borne much, and witnessed much, and feared much, but not this! This crime is too much for the most devoted love to bear!” She was suddenly startled from her meditations by a slight whistle at a little distance. This was followed by a voice. “Hist!” was the gentle summons that demanded her attention from the thicket on the river banks, as she turned in the direction of the grounds. Her first feminine instinct prompted her to fly; but the masculine resolution of her mind emboldened her, and she advanced towards the spot from whence the summons proceeded. As she approached, a head, and then the shoulders of a man, were elevated to the surface, as if from the bed of the river; and a closer approximation proved the stranger to be an old acquaintance. “John Bannister!” exclaimed the maiden. “Yes, Miss Flora, the very man, what's left of him.” “What's left of him, John Bannister. Why, what's the matter? are you hurt?” “No, no, Miss Flora, I say what's left of me, only, because, you see, I don't feel as if I was altogether a perfect man, when I have to dodge and shirk about, not able to find my friends, and always in a sort of scatteration of limbs for fear that my enemies will find me. I am pretty well to do in health at this present, thanks be to God for all his mercies, though, when you saw me last, I reckon you thought I was in a bad fix. But I give 'em the slip handsomely, and used their own legs in coming off.” “How was it, Bannister?—But, come up. You must be standing rather uncomfortably there?” “Pretty well off, thank you. There's a dug-out under me, and as I've only a word or two to say, I needn't git up any higher to say it.” “Well, as you please; but how did you make your escape from the British, John?” “Ah! that's a long story, Miss Flora, and there's no needcessity for telling it any how. Some other time when the war's over, and every man can be brave a bit, without danger, I'll let you know the sarcumstances. But jest now, what I come for is to give you warning. You've got a sly rascal as ever lived in your house, at this present, that never yet was in any one place so long without doing mischief—one Watson Gray—” “Why, he's attending on Mr. Conway.” “It's a pair on 'em, I tell you. That Watson Gray's after mischief, and it's a mischief that has you in it. But don't be scared. I want to let you know that there's one friend always at your sarvice, and nigh enough to have a hand in any business that consarns his friends. If any thing happens, do you see, jest you hang a slip of white stuff—any old rag of a dress, or handkerchief,— on this bluff here, jest where you see me standing, and I'll see it before you're gone far, or I'm no scout fit for the Congaree. If there's danger to you, there's help too; and so far as the help of a good rifle and a strong arm can go,—and I may say Miss Flora without familiarity —a good friend—dang my buttons, if you shan't have it.” “But, John,—from what quarter is this danger to come? What is it—how will it come?” “Ah, that's the danger. You might as well ax in what shape Satan will come next. But the d—l's in 15* your house, that's enough. Be careful when he flies he don't carry off much more than he brought in. May be, you'll see a man to-morrow or the next day, coming to Watson Gray; he's about my heft, but jest with one half the number of arms. He's a stout chap, poor fellow, to be cut short in that way. Now,—you can trust him. If he says to you—`come;'—do you come! If he says `stay,' then do you stay; for he's honest, and though he seems to be working for Watson Gray, he's working handsomely agen him. You can trust him. He's our man. I convarted him to a good onderstanding of the truth, but I had to make every turn of it clear to him before he'd believe. We had two good argyments, but I throw'd him the last time, and he's been sensible to the truth ever since. 'Twas him that helped me out of the British clutches t'other day. But we won't talk of that. Only you jest believe him, and hang out the white flag, here, under the bluff, if ever you need a friend's sarvice.” “You confound and confuse me only, John Bannister, by what you have said. I believe that you mean me well, and that you think there is some danger; and I am willing to trust you;—but, I don't like this half confidence. Speak out plainly. What am I to fear? I am a woman, it's true, but I am not a coward. I think I can hear the very worst, and think about it with tolerable courage afterwards; nay, assist somewhat perhaps, in your deliberations.” “Lord love you, Miss Flora, if I was to tell you the little, small, sneaking signs, that makes a scout know when he's on trail of an inimy, you'd mount-be only laugh. You wouldn't believe, and you couldn't onderstand. No! no! jest you keep quiet and watch for the smoke. As soon as you see the smoke, you'll know there's a fire onder it; which is as much as to say, jest when you see any thing onderhand going on—scouts running this way, and scouts running that, and Watson Gray at the bottom of all and busy, then you may know brimstone's going to burn, and maybe gunpowder. Keep a sharp eye on that same Watson Gray. Suspicion him afore all. He's a cunning sarpent that knows how to hide under a green bush, and look like the yallow flow'r that b'longs to it.” “You said something about Mr. Conway—Mr. Edward Conway, John?” “He's another sarpent. But—” The head of the scout sank below the bank. He had disappeared, as it were, in the bottom of the river; and while Flora Middleton trembled for apprehension, lest he had sunk into the stream, she was relieved by the accents of a voice at some little distance behind her, as of one approaching from the house. She turned to encounter Mr. Surgeon Hillhouse in his dove-coloured underclothes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. THE RETURN OF THE “BLACK RIDERS.” The reader is already familiar with the business of the surgeon, and has probably conjectured the sort of answer which he received from the heiress of Middleton Barony. His dove-coloured garments, and rose-colour address, availed him little; though, it may be added, such was the fortunate self-complaisance of the suitor, that, when he retired from the field, he was still in considerable doubt of the nature of the answer which he had received. It was still a question in his mind whether he had been refused or not. According to his usual modes of thinking, his doubts were reasonable enough. He had taken more than ordinary pains to perfect himself in the form of application which he intended to use. His fine sayings had been conned with great circumspection, and got by rote with the persevering perfectness of a schoolboy or a parrot. He had prepared himself to say a hundred handsome phrases. The colours of the rainbow and the various odours of the flowers, had been made to mingle in a delicate adaptation to his particular parts of speech, in all the best graces of that Euphuism of which, among his own clique, he had been usually recognised as the perfect master. He knew that Lady Belle would have turned up her eyes to heaven, in new-born ecstasies, had he but spoken his pretty speeches to her; and those of Lady Grace would have been filled with tears of a similar delight. How could he bring himself to believe that they had been thrown away on the unpractised auditories of the maid of Congaree? The more he asked himself this question, the more difficult became his belief, and by the time that he reached his chamber, he was convinced that, at the most, he had only suffered an evasion,—such an evasion as dandies are apt to practise upon their tailors, when they avoid, without refusing, payment;—such an evasion as a cunning damsel might practise upon her lover, lest a too sudden concession might cheapen the value of her charms. So consoling was this new conviction, that he determined, in discarding his dove-coloured small-clothes, not to put on his “Night-shade,”—so he called his “Despondency” or “Night-dress;” but to select a dark orange-tinted garment—his “Pleasant-sadness”—as more certainly expressive of mingled hope and doubt, than any other colour. The serious examination which took place in his mind, and of his wardrobe, before his choice was determined, served, beneficially, to sustain his sensibilities under the shock which they had necessarily suffered. That evening he was pleasingly pensive, and his eloquence was agreeably enlivened by an occasional and long-drawn sigh. Flora Middleton did not suffer this “Mosca” to afflict her thoughts. Naturally of a serious and earnest character, she had other sources of disquietude which effectually banished so light an object from her contemplation; and nothing could so completely have mystified the surgeon, as the calm, unmoved, and utterly unaffected manner with which she made the usual inquiries at the evening table. “Does your coffee suit you, Mr. Hillhouse. Is it sweet enough?” “Would all things were equally so, Miss Middleton. We might dispense with the sweet in the coffee, could we escape from the bitter of life.” “I should think, Sir, that you had not been compelled to drink much of it; or you have swallowed the draught with wonderful resignation.” “Alas!—have I not!” and he shook his smooth, sleek locks mournfully, from side to side, as if nobody had ever known such a long continued case of heartache as his own. But Flora did not laugh. She was in no mood for it; and though the frequent niaiseries of the surgeon might have provoked her unbounded merriment at another time, her heart was too full of her own doubts and difficulties not to deprive her, most effectually, of any such disposition now. The next day she was somewhat startled at the sudden arrival of a man at the barony, whom she instantly recognised as the person meant by John Bannister when he spoke to her the day before. His frame was like that of Bannister, and he was deficient in one of his arms. She fancied, too, that he watched her with a good deal of interest, as he passed her on the staircase, making his way to the apartment of the invalid, and his attendant, Gray. It was evident that Bannister had some intimate knowledge of what was going on among her inmates, and this was another reason why her own anxieties should increase, as she remembered the warnings to watchfulness which the worthy scout had given her. She was well disposed to confide in him. Strange to say, though she knew him chiefly as the friend of Clarence Conway, and had every present reason to believe in the faithlessness and unworthiness of the latter, her confidence in, and esteem for, John Bannister, remained entirely unimpaired. The wonder was that Conway should have so entirely secured the affections of such a creature. This wonder struck Flora Middleton, but she had heard of such instances, and it does not seem unnatural that there should be still some one, or more, who, in the general belief in our unworthiness, should still doubt and linger on, and love to the very last. We are all unwilling to be disappointed in our friends, not because they are so, but because it is our judgment which has made them so. Bewildered, and with a heavy heart, that seemed ominous of approaching evil, Flora retired to her chamber with an aching head, while our old acquaintance, Isaac Muggs, the landlord, was kept in busy consultation with the outlaw and his confidant. We pass over all such portions of the conference as do not promise to assist us in our narrative; and the reader may fancy for himself the long ejaculations which the landlord made at finding his old associate and captain reduced to his present condition;— ejaculations which were increased in length and lugubriousness in due proportion with the treachery which Muggs meditated, and of which he had already been guilty. “Enough, enough of your sorrow, good Isaac,” said the outlaw, with some impatience: “these will do for a time when we have more leisure, and as little need of them. Give me good news in as few words as possible. Your good wishes I can readily understand without your speaking them.” Muggs professed his readiness to answer—and Watson Gray conducted the inquiry; Morton, assisting only at moments, when moved by a particular anxiety upon some particular point. “Did you meet Brydone before you separated from Rawdon's army?” “Yes: he joined us at Ninety-Six.” “He told you the plan.” “Yes.” “You are willing? You've got the boats?” “I can get them.” “When—in what time?” “Well, in four days, I reckon, if need be.” “Are you sure?” “I reckon, I may say so. I'm pretty sarten.” Here Morton turned upon the couch, and half raised himself from it. “Look you, Muggs, you speak with only half a heart. You seem scared at something. What's the matter with you, man, are you not willing.” “Yes, cap'in, I'm willing. I'll do all that you ax me.” “That is, you'll get the boats in readiness, here, at the landing, within four days; but, are you willing to fly yourself. You are not fool enough to fancy that the rebels will let you remain here when the army's gone, to enjoy what you've despoiled them of.” “No great deal, cap'in, I reckon.” “Ay, but there is, Muggs! You cannot deceive me, though you may the rest. I know your gains, and a word of mine would send them flying much more rapidly than they were even brought together. Do not provoke me, man, to speak that word.” “Well, cap'in, I don't want to provoke you. Don't I tell you that I'll do all you wish.” “Ay, but you seem d—d lukewarm about it, Muggs; and you have not said whether you are willing to join our fortunes or not. Now, you join us, heart and soul, body and substance, one and all, or we cut loose from you at once. You are in our power, Muggs, and we can destroy you at a moment's warning. But it's neither our policy nor wish to do so. You can help us materially, and we are willing to help you in return. Bounty lands await you in the West Indies. You will live with old friends and neighbours, and with your guineas—” “Mighty few of them, I reckon, cap'in,” said Muggs. “Few or many, you can only save them by flight. Are you ready? Beware how you answer! Beware! You must go with us entirely, or not at all.” An acute observer might have seen, while the outlaw was speaking, an expression of resistance in the face of the landlord, which did not argue the utmost deference for the speaker, and seemed to threaten an outbreak of defiance. But if Muggs felt any such mood, he adopted the wiser policy of suppressing it for the present. “'Swounds, cap'in,” he exclaimed, with more earnestness than he had before shown in the interview—“You talk as if you was dub'ous of me,—as if I worn't your best friend from the beginning. I'm willing to go with you, I'm sure, wherever you think it safest; but you're mistaken if you think I've got so much to lose, and so much to carry away. Mighty little it would be, if the rebels did find every guinea and shilling in my keeping.” “Pshaw, Muggs, you cannot blind me with that nonsense. Be your guineas few or many, it is enough that you know where to carry them, and how to keep them in safety. And now, what of Rawdon? Where did you leave him?” “At Ninety-Six.” “He had beaten Greene?” “Run him only.” “Well: what next. Does Rawdon leave a garrison at Ninety-Six?” “I reckon not. There was some talk that he means to sarve it as he sarved Camden. Burn the town, and tear up the stockade.” “As I thought.” “Was the troop still with him?” “No: they were gone after Conway, somewhere above upon the Eunoree.” “May they find him, and batter out each other's brains at the meeting;” was the pious and fraternal wish of the outlaw. “And now, Muggs,” he continued, “the sooner you take your departure the better. Get your boats ready, yourself, and guineas, and be at the landing here, at midnight, four days hence.” “So soon!” said Gray. “Do you think, captain, you'll be able by that time?” “Ay! able for any thing. I must be able. This flight of Rawdon will deprive me of my ability to stay.” “But he has not fled yet?” “No: but he will fly and must. He is preparing for it now, and I have for some time past been aware of the approaching necessity. He must not descend the country before I do, that is certain; and if I can descend the Santee in boats, I can endure a wagon the rest of the way, to the head of Cooper river. The rest is easy. The important object is to secure faithful boatmen, and with you, Muggs, and a few others, upon whom I can rely, I have no doubts, and no apprehensions.” The landlord was dismissed upon his secret mission. Watson Gray conducted him to the banks of the river, where lay the identical boat in which our friend John Bannister had approached the shore in seeking the interview with Flora Middleton. It was huddled up in the green sedges and bushes at the edge of the river swamp, and thus concealed from the eyes of the passing spectator. Before parting, Gray gave his final instructions to the landlord, in which he contemplated every matter essential to the journey, and, perhaps, conducted the affair with less offence to the feelings of the latter than had been the case on the part of the outlaw. Scarcely had Watson Gray gone from sight, before Bannister emerged from the swamp thicket and joined the other. “He's a cute chap, that same Watson Gray, as ever beat about a thicket without getting into the paws of a black bear at rutting season. I'm athinking if the man was decent honest, I'd sooner have him in a troop of mine, than any man I knows on. He's a raal keener for a sarch. I'd reckon now, Isaac Muggs, from the way he slobber'd you over in talking, that he was a meaning to swallow you when all was done.” “I reckon that's his meaning, Supple Jack,—I'm dub'ous that's what both he and the cap'in are a conjuring.” “And I'm thinking, Muggs, that he was a trying to ease off something that he said to you before, which went agin the grain, and made the teeth grit.” “Twa'nt him that said it—'twas the cap'in!” “A pair on 'em—both sarpents,—mou't-be, different kinds of sarpent; but the bite of a rattle or a viper, is, after all, the bite of a sarpent; and it don't matter much which a man dies of, when both can kill. But what made the captain graze agin your feelings?” “Why, he's a-trying to make a scare of me about staying here, when he's gone. He says there's no safety for me among the rebels.” “I reckon, Isaac Muggs, there's an easy answer for all that. You've jest got to p'int to me, and say, “that' ere man convarted me by strong argyment, and I reckon nobody'll be so bold as to touch you after that.” “He threatened me too,—and I to be the first to advise him to make long tracks from the troop!” “I'm mighty sorry you ever give him such advice, Isaac,” said Bannister, rebukingly. VOL. II. 16 “Yes: but though he made b'lieve that he was angry and all that, now, to-night, he tells me how he's been getting ready a long time for a start.” “I b'lieve him! Indeed, I knows as much! Well, I'm willing that he should get away, Isaac Muggs, without any hurt to hair or hide. For, though he desarves hanging and quartering as much as ever man desarved it, yet he's come of the same blood, half-way, with Clarence Conway; and for his sake, I'm willing to let Ned Conway get clear of the hanging. I shouldn't be so mighty anxious to help him out of the way of a bullet, for that's the business of a soldier, to die by shot or steel, and it don't disgrace him, though it's hurtful to his feelings. I'd help to find the boat for him myself, and send him on his way, if he was content to git off with his own hide in safety. But when he's after his villany to the last— when I know that he wants to carry off another Congaree gal, and, this time, agin her will—” “I'm a-thinking, Supple, that you're clear mistaken in that. Neither him nor Gray said a word about it.” “Not to you, Isaac. They'd ha' been but small sodgers if they had. No! no! They know'd better. They know'd that twan't the way to get their business done, to make it more difficult. They were rather dub'ous of you, you say yourself, jest to carry off the captain. Would it ha' made it any easier to tell you that they wanted you to help to carry off the young woman from her friends and family; and, as I'm thinking, to stop also in their way down and clean the plantation of his father's widow, of all it's niggers? No! no! Isaac! They know how to play the game better than that. They tell you they play for high and low, only; but watch them well, or they'll make Jack too, and try mighty hard to count. But, the game's in our hands now, Isaac: at least, I'm a-thinking so. As for you and your guineas,—I don't ax you how many you've got—but jest you do as I tell you, and I'll answer for their safety. We'll get the boats and the hands between us, and we'll have 'em all ready when the time comes, and if the gal is to be whipped off, it won't make it less pleasant to us to have the handling of her. Do you cross the river now, and be sure and put the boat high up in the creek. I'll keep on this side though. I have a leetle matter of business here.” “You're mighty venturesome, Supple.” “It's a sort o' natur', Isaac. I was always so. A leetle dance on the very edge of the dangerous place, is a sort of strong drink to me, and makes my blood warm and agreeable. I'll jest scout about the woods here and see who's waking and who's sleeping; and who's a-tween sleeping and waking like myself.” The first attentions of Jack Bannister were paid to the sleeping. He watched the progress of his comrade, until his little barge had disappeared from sight in the distance, then made his way with the intensity of a natural affection, to the lonely spot where his hands had dug the grave for Mary Clarkson, and where her body had been laid. Here he paused a few moments in silent meditation, then proceeded to the dense thicket to which, on the night when she fled from the barony, he bore her inanimate person. When he reached the spot, he kindled his light, and drew from a hollow tree a hatchet and rude saw which had been formed from an old sabre, the teeth of which had been made by hacking it upon some harder edge than its own. He then produced from another place of concealment sundry pieces of timber, upon which he had already spent some labour, and to which his labour was again addressed. Gradually, a long, slender, and not unpleasingly wrought shaft of white wood appeared beneath his hands, into which he mortised the arms of a cross, with a degree of neatness, and symmetry, which would have done no discredit to the toils of a better artist, under the more certain guidance of the daylight. This little memento, he was evidently preparing, in silence and seclusion, and with that solemnity which belongs to the pure and earnest affection for the lonely grave which he had just visited. With a fond toil, which withheld no care, and spared no effort, he now addressed himself—his more heavy task being finished—to a portion of his work which, perhaps, was the most fatiguing of his labour. This was to cut into the wood the simple initials of the poor girl for whom the memorial was intended. Our worthy woodman was no architect, and the rude Gothic letters which his knife dug into the wood, may perhaps have awakened, subsequently, the frequent smile of the irreverent traveller, as he himself murmured while at this work— “It's a precious small chance for l'arning that Jack Bannister ever got upon the Congaree; but it's the best that I can do for poor Mary, and I'd ha' been willing to give her the best of me from the beginning. But twa'nt ordered so by Providence, and there's no use for further talk about it. If I hadn't used a man's we'pon upon her, I'd be a-mighty deal more easy now, but God knows, 'twan't meant for her—'twan't any how from the heart— and 'twas nateral that a man should strike, hard and quick, when he finds another jumping out upon him from the bush. Who'd ha' thought to find a gal in man's clothes, jest then too, in the thick of the fighting? But the Lord's over all, and he does it for the best. It's done, but there's a many more to come. I'll put a mark that they can make out, though the printing mayn't be so stiff and fine. There's a mighty ugly lean about that `M.,' jest as if 'twas a-tumbling for'a'd upon the `C:' and I thought I had run pretty even; but there's no mending it now. It must stand.” From his horn, he filled with powder the lines which he had cut in the wood, and then ignited it. The blackened traces made the simple inscription sufficiently distinct, and the good fellow, shouldering his rude monument, bore it to the grave, and drove it down at the head of the inmate. He had not well finished this work, before he fancied that he heard foreign sounds mingling suddenly with the murmurs of the Congaree, as it plied its incessant way below. He listened, and the murmurs deepened. He went forward, cautiously, through the wood, and it was not long before he discerned the advance of a body of men, all well mounted, whom, upon a nearer approach, he discerned to be the Black Riders. John Bannister was not a man to be alarmed easily; but he retreated, and stole into the cover of a bay, the thicket of which he knew was not penetrable by cavalry. Here, he crouched in silence, and the formidable band of outlaws slowly wound along in silence, through the forest, and on the very edge of the thicket in which he lay concealed. A new care filled his bosom, as he beheld their progress in the direction of the barony. He had no means of contending with such a force, and where was Clarence Conway? Feeling for his commander, and sympathizing with his affections, the first thought of Bannister had reference to the new dangers which beset the path of Flora Middleton. He was surprised, however, to perceive that the banditti came to a halt but a little distance from him. They alighted, the words of command were passed in whispers, and in ten minutes they prepared to bivouac.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. MESHES. “Well, it's mighty strange, I'm thinking, that they don't go for'a'd. They're as cautious and scary, now, as if the whole of Sumter's rigiment was at the Park. They're after some new mischief, that's more in want of a night covering than any they've ever done before. Well, we'll see! There's Watson Gray with his corporal guard at the house; and here's the Black Riders here; and if the two git together, it's precious little that John Bannister can do, with the help of Isaac Muggs, and he with one hand only. If I could work poor Jake Clarkson out of their fingers, he'd make a third, and no small help he'd give us in a straight for'a'd, up and down fight. But, I'm dub'ous he stands a bad chance in the grip of Watson Gray. If I could git round now to the barony, and show reason to Miss Flora, to slip off to the river, I wouldn't wait for Ned Conway to stir; but I'd hide her away in the Congaree, where the swamp-fox, himself, couldn't find her. But then there's no 16* hope of that. There's a sort of strange thinking among young women, that's never had a husband, as if it wouldn't be so decent and dilicate, to trust a single man under such sarcumstances; which is mighty foolish! But something must be done, and John Bannister must be in the way of doing it. Lord love us!—if he would only send Clarence now, with fifty of his troop, among these bloody black reffygees!” The course of John Bannister's thoughts may be traced in the above soliloquy. The good fellow felt the difficulties of his own position, though, it is clear, that apprehension for himself was the last subject in his mind; the only one which awakened no anxiety, and called forth little consideration. To rescue Flora Middleton was his sole object. He knew the desires of Edward Conway for that maiden, and naturally concluded that the arrival of his troop would give him the power to accomplish his wishes, even by violence, if necessary. It was therefore a reasonable occasion for surprise and conjecture, when he found the outlaws taking their halt and supper on the skirts of the barony, and in profound silence and secresy; where nothing lay in the way to prevent or retard their reunion with their captain. He little knew the character and extent of those malign influences, which prevailed among that wild and savage body, unfavourable to their ancient leader. It was with increasing concern and interest that Bannister, in following and watching the movements of the outlaws, found them about to throw a line of sentinels between the grounds of the barony and the river landing. This measure denoted certain suspicions which they entertained, as he fancied, of the practices in which he had been recently engaged; and it became necessary that he should find means to apprise his comrade, Muggs, on the other side of the Congaree, of the danger that awaited any undue exposure of his person in his future crossings to and fro. “A long swim!”—muttered the faithful scout, with a slight shiver, as he surveyed the river;—“and rather a cold swim, too, at midnight; but I'll have to do it. If I don't they'll riddle poor Isaac's belly with bullets, when he's thinking of nothing worse to put in it than his breakfast. But I must dodge about the house first and see what's a-going on in that quarter. It seems strange to me that they shouldn't have made themselves known to their captain! What's to be afraid of? But rogues is always a myster'ous and dub'ous sort of things. A rascal never goes straight to his business. If he has to shake hands with you he does it with a sort of twist, and a twirl, and sometimes a squint, that looks every which way but the right one. Now, it's reasonable that a good scout should shy off, and dodge, and make himself as squat and small, under a bush, as he naterally can, and as a big body will let him;—but when the game's a straight for'a'd one; when there's no dangers nor inimy, and only one's own affairs to see after—it's a sign of a rogue all over that he shirks. It shows that he shirks from the love of the thing and not because it's a needcessity.” John Bannister did not suffer his moral philosophy to keep him inactive. He was one of those who philosophize yet go forward—a race of which the world has comparatively few. In obedience to his determination, as expressed above, he stole through ways, which had been sufficiently traversed by his feet to be familiar, which led him, without detection, to the grounds immediately about the mansion. At the front door of the dwelling, which was closed, he saw one sentinel on duty. But he yawned, emphatically and loud, more than once while the scout was watching him; and by his listless movements seemed evidently weary enough of his watch to leave it to itself at the first seasonable summons. The most perfect military subordination was not preserved by him as he paced to and fro along the court. He sang, and whistled, and soliloquized; and, not unfrequently, relieved the dull measured step of the sentinel, by the indulgence of such a gavotte, as a beef-eating British soldier of the “prince's own” might be supposed capable of displaying in that period of buckram movement. “He'd hop higher and dance a mighty sight better,” murmured John Bannister as he beheld the “signor of the night” in this grave exercise, “if he was only on the `liberty' side of the question. He gits a shilling a day, and a full belly; but he ain't got the light heart after all. Give me a supper of acorns, b'iled or unb'iled, in the Santee swamp, before all his hot bread, if so be, the cause I'm a-fighting for can't give me better heart to dance than that. Lord! he can no more shake a leg with the Congaree Blues than he can sight a rifle.” Contenting himself with this comparison, and the brief survey which had induced it, he turned away, and traversing the settlement, came to the out-house in which, once before, he had seen the guard busy in their gaming practices. A light glimmering through the log chinks apprised him of the presence there of occupants; and, approaching cautiously, and peeping through an aperture in the rear of the mud structure, he was struck with the sight of an object, to him, of very painful interest. This was Jake Clarkson, very securely fastened with ropes, which confined both his hands and feet. The old man leaned rather than sat, against the wall of one section of the building. A dull composure, which seemed that of mortal apathy, overspread the poor fellow's countenance. His eyes were half closed, his mouth drawn down, and open, and the listlessness of death, if not its entire unconsciousness, prevailed in the expression of all his features. Four of the soldiers were present in the apartment; two of them stretched at length upon the floor, seemingly asleep; and the other two, busy to themselves, playing languidly at their favourite game, which they relieved by a dialogue carried on sufficiently loud to enable Bannister to learn its purport. From this he gathered enough to know that the improvement of Edward Conway was such as to promise them a change, for which they pined,—from the dull monotonous recurrence of the same unexciting duties, to the adventures of the march, and all those circumstances of perpetual change, which compensate the rover for all the privations which he must necessarily undergo in leaving his early homestead. But the eyes and thoughts of Bannister were fixed on the prisoner only. The pressure of surrounding foes only made him the more anxious to gather and secure his friends, and thinking of poor Mary—was also calculated to make him eagerly desirous to restore her father. This desire grew more keen and irresistible the more he watched and reflected, and it was with some difficulty that he restrained his lips from the impetuous assertion of his determination to release him from his bonds or perish. This resolve, though not expressed aloud, was still the occasion of a brief soliloquy. “Dang my buttons, if I don't try it. If there's time it can be done, and there's no harm in trying. A rifle in Jake's hands is a something that acts as well as speaks; and if so be, we're to have trouble, a bullet from a twisted bore is a mighty good argyment in clearing the track for the truth. It's a sort of axe-stroke, leading the way for the grubbing-hoe.” Ten minutes after, and Jake Clarkson was roused from his stupor by the slight prick of a sharp instrument from behind him. The nervous sensibility of the old man had been pretty well blunted by time, trial, and misfortune; and he neither started nor showed the slightest symptom of excitement. But his eyes grew brighter, his mind was brought back to the world in which his body lingered still; and a lively apprehension was awakened within him, lest the gambling soldiers should see, or hear, the hand that he now felt was busy in the effort to extricate him from his bonds. He did not dare to stir or look; but he was already conscious that the couteau de chasse of the woodman, fastened to a long stick, had been thrust through the crevices of the logs, and was busily plied in sawing asunder the cords that fastened his arms. These had been tied behind the prisoner, and he prudently kept them in that position even though, in a few moments after, he felt that their ligatures had yielded to the knife. The workman ceased from without. His task, so far as it could be effected by him, seemed to be ended; but the feet of the prisoner were still secured. The friendly assistant seemed to have disappeared. A full half hour elapsed and he heard nothing. The soldiers still kept at their game, and the prisoner, exhausted with the excitement of his new hope, leaned once more against the wall. In doing so he again felt the sharp prick of the knife-point. Cautiously, but with nerves that now trembled for the first time, he availed himself of one of his freed hands to possess himself of the instrument, which now, separated from the handle, had been left, by the scout, for the farther benefit of the prisoner. He clutched it with a strange delight. The momentary impulse almost moved him to spring to his feet, and bound upon the guard with the most murderous determination. But the prudence of his friend's course from without, was not wasted upon him. He quietly secured the knife behind him, placed his hands in the same position in which his cords had previously secured them, and, with new hopes in his bosom, prepared to wait the proper moment when he might safely proceed to finish the work of his emancipation. Satisfied that he had done all that he could, at the time, for the rescue of Clarkson, the scout took his way back to the river, the banks of which he ascended a few hundred yards, and then, without reluctance, committed himself to the stream. Half-way across, the rocks afforded him a momentary resting-place, from which he surveyed, with a mournful satisfaction, the white cross which his hands, but a little while before, had reared upon the grave of Mary Clarkson. It stood conspicuous in sight for several miles along the river. The still hours of the night were speeding on; and the murmur of the river began to be coupled with the sudden notes of birds, along its banks, anticipating the approach of the morning. A sense of weariness for the first time began to fill the frame of the woodman, and it needed a strong and resolute effort to prevent himself from yielding to sleep upon the slippery black rock which gave him a temporary resting-place in the bosom of the stream. Plunging off anew, he reached the opposite banks, fatigued but not dispirited; and soon transferred the duties of the watch to his comrade. To the landlord he briefly communicated the events of the evening, and bestowed upon him the necessary caution. Meanwhile, a spirit equally anxious and busy, pervaded the breasts of some few in the encampment of the Black Riders. The watches had been set, the guards duly placed, and the sentinels, being made to form a complete cordon around the barony, Lieutenant Stockton, acting as captain, went aside, in consultation with his apt coadjutor, Ensign Darcy. The tone and language of the former were, now, much more elevated, more confident and exulting, than usual. The realization of his desires was at hand. He had met the approbation of Lord Rawdon, in the conduct which he had displayed in the management of his troop, during the late march, and nothing seemed wanting to his wishes, but that his immediate superior should be no longer in his way. But to supersede him was not easy, since the personal grounds of hostility which Stockton felt could not be expressed to their mutual superior; and these were such as to lead the former to desire something beyond the mere command of the troop which he had in charge. It was necessary not merely to degrade but to destroy his principal. The humiliating secret which Edward Morton possessed, to his detriment, was equally an occasion for his hate and fear; and all his arts had been exercised to find some pretext for putting out of his way a person whose continued life threatened him with constant and humiliating exposure. Circumstances had co-operated with the desires of the conspirators. The secret of Edward Morton had been betrayed. It was known that he desired to escape from the troop;—that he was planning a secret flight to the city;—that he had already sent off considerable treasure; and, that he awaited nothing but a partial recovery of his strength, and the arrival of certain boats which had been pledged to him by the landlord, Muggs, to put his project in execution. In this proceeding, he had violated the laws of the confederacy—the fearful oath which bound the outlaws together; —an oath taken in blood; and the violation of which incurred all the penalties of blood. No wonder that Stockton exulted. His proceedings were now all legitimate. His hate had a justifiable sanction, according to the tenets of his victim, equally with himself. It was the law of the troop. It was now indeed his duty to prosecute to the death the traitor who would surrender all of them to destruction; and the only remaining security left to Morton was the rigid trial to which his band was sworn. The bloody doom which his treachery incurred, was to be inflicted only after the fullest proofs that it was justly merited. In this lay his only hope of safety, and this hope rested upon a slender foundation. One of his special and most trusted agents had been brought over by the machinations of Darcy, and had betrayed him. He had involved another of the band in his developements, and this other had confessed. Two witnesses concurring against him and the proof was held to be conclusive; and of these two witnesses Stockton was secure. But other considerations were involved in the deliberations of the parties. Edward Morton they knew to be a desperate man. Watson Gray was a man to be feared as well as hated. These were in possession of a strong brick dwelling, with probably a dozen musketeers under arms, and commanded by Rawdon to obey them in every particular. It was no part of the policy of Stockton to come to blows under such circumstances. Some artifice was necessary to effect his objects. To get the soldiers out of the way, to baffle Gray, and secure possession of Edward Morton, was the design which they had resolved upon, and this required considerable management, and excessive caution in their approach. Besides, one of their witnesses was absent on a scout, and to declare their purpose until he was present to maintain it by his oath would have been rash and imprudent. It was also their object to capture the landlord, Muggs, whose proposed agency in securing the boats for the flight of Edward Morton was known to the conspirators through the individual who had first betrayed his employer to his enemies. Hence the watch which had been set upon the river-landing, and which had compelled Bannister to swim the stream that night. These matters formed the subjects of deliberation between the two conspirators. Their successes, so far, made them sanguine of the future; and the rich rewards which it promised them, made them equally joyful. The treasures of their captain were to be equally divided between themselves, and we find them accordingly quite as busy in counting, as in securing their chickens. “Pete Flagg has charge of the negroes, over two hundred already, and there are those from the place of his stepmother, which he planned to take off with him in these boats of Muggs. I know where to go for his guineas—ay, to lay my hands upon the vault; but we must get the memorandum acknowledgment which I reckon he has about him, from John Wagner, who keeps his money. There must be three thousand guineas at the least. “We share equally,” said Stockton, with eager eyes. “That of course is understood.” “Yes: but there should be a private paper between us,” said Darcy. “What need? we know each other.” “Ay, but the best friends cannot be too cautious. I have drawn out a little memorandum which we can both sign to-morrow.” “Agreed; I'm willing. But no witnesses, Darcy— that would ruin all.” “Yes—that's the d—l. Let the troop once know what we eount upon—and our chance would be as bad, or even worse than his. We should hang with him!” “Him we have! Him we have! I would Brydone were here. I long for the moment to wind up our long account of hate. It will be the sweetest moment of my life when I command them to drag him to the tree.” “Be patient—don't let your hate risk our gains. We can get nothing by working rashly. These eight or ten soldiers that he has here would make desperate fight. That scoundrel, Gray, must have suspected us when he asked Rawdon for them.” “Well, well—he'll have his turn also.” “I doubt we'll have to fix him along with the captain. He's a bird out of the same nest.” “I shall be willing. I have no love for him.” “Did you tell Brydone when to meet you here?” “Yes!—that's all arranged!” “By that time we ought to have possession of the captain.” VOL. II. 17 “Ay, then, or never! We must have him and all things in readiness by the time Brydone comes. Are you sure of the men? Is there none doubtful?” “None!—There's a few milk-hearted fellows only, but they're of the scary sort. They'll offer no opposition when they find so many against them.” “Be sure of them also, if you can. I'd even give something to make all sure. There must be no bungling at the last moment. If there is, and he has any chance to talk, he is so d—d artful of tongue, that he'd work courage in the most cowardly heart. I fear him still.” “I do not. I know them, and I know him,” replied the subordinate. “His day is done. He hasn't the same power over them that he had of old, and the late profits have enlightened them considerably on the subject of your better management.” “Yes—those guineas were good arguments, I think.” “Famous!—but the better is to be shown. His treachery is the best. Let them but know conclusively that his purpose was to give them up, break the law, and leave them—perhaps, betray them first into Sumter's clutches—and there will be but one voice among them, and that will be, `death to the traitor!”' “So be it. To-morrow night we have him, and with the rise of another sun he dies.” “Yes, if Brydone come in time for the trial.” “Brydone or not, Darcy—he dies.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. BAGATELLE BEFORE BUSINESS. This will suffice to show the policy of the confederates. Their plans of treachery were nearly complete, and they were weaving them with the silent industry and circumspection of the spider, who already sees and has chosen his victim. Little did Edward Morton fancy, at this moment, the web that environed, and the dangers which threatened him. He, himself, was busy in his own plans of similar treachery. His wounds were healing fast, his strength returning, and, with his strength came back the old passions of evil, which had heretofore inflamed his heart to its own debasement. The mournful fate of the poor Mary Clarkson had already passed from his thought, and almost from his memory; and, if remembered at all, it was only in connection with the new feeling of freedom which he felt in her absence. Her death he now regarded as a sort of providential interference, by which he was relieved of a burden at the auspicious moment when it must have become more burdensome than ever. Circumstances seemed to favour him on every hand, and the influence of mind upon matter was never more favourably shown than in the improvement of his health and strength, under the agreeable sensations which he experienced from a review of all the promising circumstances which seemed to await his recovery. In a few days, his barque, richly freighted, was to bear him away to a region of security and peace; in which, free from all the harassing dangers which had so long attended his progress, he was to enjoy the fruit of his toils, and taste the luxuries of a fresh and long desired delight. He would shake himself free from his old connections—a wish long since entertained; he would fly with the woman whom he loved, from the foes whom he feared and hated, to the peace for which he had yearned, and to that affluence which a mercenary appetite for gain had already accumulated in abundance. No wonder that, revelling in these convictions, he laughed and sung at intervals, as Watson Gray and himself discussed their mutual plans, and glowing expectations. The skies never seemed to look down more propitiously bright than upon their joint wishes and performances; and even Watson Gray, habitually stern and composed in his bearing and demeanour, condescended to join in his principal's merriment, and to minister to his mirthful mood, by a relation of such of the particulars of the surgeon's wooing as had come to his knowledge. We have seen the share which Gray had in promoting the objects of Hillhouse. He knew, of course, that Flora Middleton would scorn such a suitor. He had already beheld the indifference —to call a thing by its most harmless epithet—with which she regarded him; and he, as well as the outlaw, knew enough of human, or rather, woman nature, to be sure that the result of his application would only be amusing and unsuccessful. Gray recounted, for the benefit of his superior, the preparatory toils which Hillhouse had undergone at his toilet,—partly in his presence,—in determining upon the colours of his suit, the style and pattern of his dress, and the manner, audacious or subdued, in which he should make his first approaches. In choosing his costume, he seemed disposed to realize the pictorial satire, with which the ancient artists used to describe the self-perplexity of the Englishman in putting on his clothes. “I am an Englishman, and naked I stand here, Musing in my mind what garment I shall wear; Now I shall wear this, and now I shall wear that, And now I shall wear—I cannot tell what!” The reader is aware that the dove-coloured suit was triumphant; but he does not so well know the peculiar air which marked the carriage of the suitor. Watson Gray had seen him depart, and had beheld him on his return. We know that by the time Hillhouse got back, he had fairly convinced himself that the unqualified rejection of Flora Middleton had been, in reality, nothing more than that ordinary evasion of the sex, of which none of them are wholly ignorant, and with which they simply mean to heighten the value of their subsequent concessions. Thus assured, his countenance wore nothing of discomfiture in its expression. Nay, so perfectly triumphant did it seem, that Gray, who could not altogether believe that the world possessed any instance of such thorough self-esteem, began to tremble lest Flora, with that weakness of the sex which makes them miracles of caprice, upon occasion, had, in her unhappy moments, been over-persuaded and had yielded. Staggered for an instant by this apprehension, he was left but a little while in doubt. When Hillhouse gave the tenor of her answer, Gray laughed outright, and hurried away to share the pleasure with his superior. The surgeon followed him to the chamber of the outlaw, as soon as he had succeeded in adopting the symbol of a fitting sentiment for the new change which he contemplated in his garments; and without intending any such favour, he delighted the invalid, by a candid revelation of the events which had just taken place, and which he deemed to be so favourable to his desires. “May you always be so fortunate,” was the generous wish of the outlaw, as the surgeon concluded his narrative. “Thank you. You are too good. I doubt not I shall be. But, in truth, is it not wonderful that a country girl —a mere rustic, as she is—should be able to practise those arts which belong only to fashionable life?” “An instinct—an instinct, my dear sir.” “Well, 'pon my affections, I think so.” “They're all alike, Mr. Hillhouse;—high and low, rich and poor, city-bred and country-bred—they all know how to baffle the ardent, and stimulate by baffling.” “It will somewhat reconcile me to the event,” said the surgeon. “I had my apprehensions about it. I should have felt the awkwardness of bringing into the upper circles the unsophisticated damsel of the woods, such as she seemed to be at first; but now—” “The instinct will save you any annoyance; but even were it otherwise, Mr. Hillhouse, how charming would it have been to have shown her in the fine world as the beautiful savage from Congaree!” “'Gad, yes! I never thought of that!” “An aboriginal princess!” “Like Powkerhorontas! Ay! I have heard of that princess. She was a Virginian princess,—my old friend, Sir Marmaduke Mincing, told me all her history: how she had fought her father, and rescued the Captain— what was his name? But no matter, it was something very low and vulgar. She married him; and Sir Marmaduke, 17* who had seen her, said she had really a very human countenance, and quite like a woman; but”— lifting his hands in horror—“her feet! They were monstrous. They were four feet rather than two! Ha! ha!—four feet—do you take me with you, Capt. Conway? Four feet rather than two!” “Ha! ha! ha!” roared Gray; and Conway also echoed the laughter of the surgeon, but it was rather at himself than his wit. “But the feet of your princess here, Miss Middleton, are really very good, and rather small feet, Mr. Hillhouse. They will occasion no fright!” “Ah, true, quite respectable as feet—quite respectable! She will do; and your idea, sir, that she would be so distingué, appearing in the character of la belle savage, reconciles all objections wonderfully. I think much better of the young creature than before. I do, really.” “No doubt you should; but Mr. Hillhouse—not to interrupt the pleasantness of your dreams—let me remark that war and love do not enjoy the same camping ground long, as they do not often employ the same weapons. The one is very apt to scare away the other. You, sir, have little time to lose. Are you aware that Lord Rawdon is on his full retreat?” “Retreat—from what?” “The enemy: he has been compelled to evacuate Ninety-Six.” “Evacuate! what an unpleasant word!” “You'll find it so, unless you proceed in your attack with increased vigour. You will soon be compelled to evacuate Briar Park, leaving la belle savage to the care of other savages not so beautiful, yet not less dangerous.” “You discompose my nerves, Capt. Conway. May I learn if all this be true—be certain?” “Too true: ask Mr. Gray. He brings me the intelligence. He has just received it.” “Sure as a gun,” said Gray. “And with quite as startling a report;” continued the outlaw. “What you do will need to be done quickly. You must press the siege.” “Night and day,” added Watson Gray. “You can't stop for regular approaches;” continued Morton. “Remember you have nothing but field works to contend with,—” “And, for—” added the surgeon, rubbing his hands with a gentle eagerness. “Sap and storm at the same moment, Mr. Hillhouse. You must go through and over the works both; or expect to raise the siege very shortly. I doubt if you have three days left you. Rawdon will be on his way for the Eutaw before that time.” “My dear friend! you rejoice while you alarm me. I will not suffer any delay. But haste is so vulgar.” “Except in flight.” “Ah! even there; one cannot dispose his garments well, and the face is flushed, and the manner is flurried. But there are cases of necessity—” “Imperative necessity!” “Yes! when we have to dispense with ordinary rules of conduct.” “All active movements are of this sort, whether they contemplate flight or assault. Your affair combines both. You must make your attack shortly, for your retreat must soon follow.” “True, most true!” “And how honourable is it to carry off a prisoner even in flight.” “It softens the necessity—it takes the shame from defeat.” “It redeems it;” said the outlaw, “and such a prisoner too! Ah! Mr. Hillhouse, you are certainly a man to be envied.” “My dear Captain, you do most certainly flatter me. But I was born under a fortunate star. I have been thus fortunate always, and particularly among the sex. Trust me to relate to you some curious successes which I have had. But I must leave you now. Forgive me that I am thus abrupt. But I go in obedience to your counsel. I go to prepare for the war. By the way, those metaphors of yours were well carried on. I shall endeavour to recall them at the first leisure; those, in which you spoke of the prosecution of my present purpose, by sap and storm, and so forth. I suspect, Captain, that you too have been rather a fortunate person, in your own way, among the women. But, your field has not been a difficult one. Women are very accessible in America, though I certainly do not agree with my old friend, but present enemy, the Marquis de Chastellux,[2] [2] For what the Marquis does say, see his “Travels in North America,” New York edition, p. 260. who says that a Frenchman may do any thing with the women of your country.” “Does he say that? the scoundrel!” exclaimed the outlaw, with a burst of provincial indignation. “Now,” continued the surgeon, “had he said Englishman for Frenchman, there would have been some reason in it; though it isn't every Englishman either, of whom such a thing might be said.” The outlaw and his comrade both looked serious. The reply of the former was made with some effort at composure, and the “wreathed smile” upon his lips was the result of some struggle with his sterner passions. “No, sir, the instances are not frequent, I suspect. But the opinion may naturally be entertained in its full extent by one who has been, and is destined to be, so uniformly successful everywhere.” “Thank you, Captain,—you are too flattering,—but I have had my successes,—I have, heaven knows!”—with an air of profound humility, as he bowed himself out of the apartment. “Heaven knows, I have had successes which might well turn the heads of wiser men than myself.” “The ape!—the monstrous ape!” exclaimed Morton, “was there ever such an ape!” “A long-eared ass;” muttered his more rude companion; “a long-eared ass, if ever there was one! If Miss Flora don't pull his ears, it won't be because she don't see 'em.” “No! It's devilish strange that such a fellow should preserve his follies amidst all his changes, and while pursuing a life, which, more than any other would be likely to lop off the affectations and conceits of boyhood.” “Well, I reckon,” said Gray, “he's just like a great many others, who know they can't pass for wise men, and are determined to pass any how. A fool would rather you'd see him as a fool than not see him at all.” “Egad!” exclaimed Morton, with all the enthusiasm of a new idea, “Egad! I think I'll see this fellow at his follies. I'll make an effort, Gray, to get down stairs this very afternoon.” “Don't think of such a thing;” said Gray. “Ay, but I will! I feel strong enough for it, and a change of objects will do me good. I long to feast my eyes also, upon the charms of the fair Flora. Zounds! had it been Clarence Conway, who lay sick and wounded in her dwelling, what a difference! She'd have deigned him a glance before this! She'd have sat beside his bed, and her hand would have been in his, and she would have played with his hair, and her long locks would have floated upon his cheek! Damnation! that fortune should thus smile upon one, and blast the other always! Thus has it been from our cradle. By heavens, Gray, I tell you, that man—boy and man—ay, when he was but a brat of an infant,—a squeaking, squalling, unconscious brat of an infant,—this jilting Jezebel, called fortune, showered her gold and jewels about him even then, and has clung to him ever since, with a constancy hardly ever known to any of her sex. All around seemed to toil in his behalf; every thing tended to his benefit; ay, even when I toiled in his despite, I have been compelled to curse the vain labour which redounded only to his good; while I—” “You've had your good fortune, too, Captain!” said Gray, condolingly. “Have I!” cried the other, dashing the mirror, upon which he had looked at that moment, into fragments at his feet; “have I, indeed? I must read it in these gashes then! Ha! must I? No, Gray; my good fortune is yet to come!” “Don't distrust fortune, Captain. I'm thinking she's been your friend quite as much as his. She's helped him in some things, perhaps, but how is he any the better for them. As for Miss Flora doing for him what she wouldn't do for you, that's all in my eye. I reckon that she looks on him now a little blacker than she ever looked, or ever will look, on you. Well, what next? After all his fortunate gettings, where is he? and after all your misfortunes, where are you? Why, he's just on the brink of losing every thing, and you are just that nigh to getting all that he loses, and perhaps a great deal more.” “Would it were now!—would I were sure. But, Gray, I have my fears, my doubts. Should that fellow fail us with his boats.” “Don't you fear. He will not fail.” “And Flora! God! could I be sure of that!” “And what's to hinder? The one answers for the other.” “Ay, not much to hinder, if we use violence. Main force may carry her off, and shall, unless she yields readily; but I tell you, Gray, I'd give half that I'm worth —half of all my spoils—but to be spared this one necessity.” “What, Captain, you're not getting mealy-mouthed in the business. Your conscience ain't troubling you, sure?” “No! It's not that I have any scruples; but the blessing of a willing prize, Gray! That, that is every thing!” “Lord knows,” rejoined the other with a yawn, “you had a willing prize enough in Mary Clarkson.” “Speak not of her, Gray;” said the other in half-faltering accents—“not now! not now!” “She was a willing prize, and one you were willing enough to get rid of. Give me the prize that don't consent in a hurry—that gives me some trouble to overcome. I wouldn't give a shilling for a wagon-load of that fruit that drops into the mouth the moment it opens for it.” “Nor I. Nor is that what I mean, Gray;—but I will see Flora this very evening. I will get down to the supper table. I am strong enough for it; and I will see for myself how she manages this silly witling. The truth is, Gray, I'm not altogether satisfied that she will feel that corn for the fellow that we feel. We judge of a man according to his own manliness; but this is not the mode of judging among women. They look at the streamers of the ship, and her gaudy paint; while men look to see if her timbers are good; if she follows the helm, if she is taut, and trim, and steady upon the wave. I believe that where it depends upon a woman's heart, where her affections are firmly enlisted, she will be true to the death, and in spite of death; but, when the matter is referable only to the judgment, I lose all confidence in her. She is then to be watched narrowly, and guided cautiously, and kept from the breakers, among which she otherwise would be sure to run. Now Flora Middleton is a woman whose mind will take a large share in her affections. She'll hardly suffer her feelings to get entirely beyond the control of her judgment; and it may be advisable that I should assist at her next conference with this gudgeon, in order to help him somewhat in the exposure of his more ridiculous qualities.” “It don't need, Captain. I reckon she's seen 'em all for herself, long before this. You'd better not go down. Better keep all your strength for the time when you'll need it all.” “What! man! Do you think I could fail then? Impossible! No! no! Gray. You're getting quite too timid to be a safe counsellor, and I'm resolved to have a glance at Flora Middleton this evening, though I die for it. I think the sight of her will give me new strength and spirit. Besides, man, it is time that I should try my experiment upon her. If you are right,—if she believes that Clarence Conway has been doing those evil deeds which I need not acknowledge, and has dismissed him for ever from her regards, then this is the very time to urge my claims and be successful. Personally, there is very little difference to the eye between us; and these d—d scars! Ha! didn't you let her know that they were got fighting with Clarence in defence of injured innocence, and all that! If so, they will not seem so very uncomely. There is yet another circumstance, Gray: I flatter myself that the contrast between myself and her present suitor, the surgeon, even in his dove-coloured breeches, will hardly be against me. Is not that something—are not all these things something? If I can persuade her, we diminish some of our labour, and several of our difficulties; and that must be tried first. I must play the lover as well as I can, before I play the conqueror. I must woo my bride, before I resort to the last mode of winning her.” “You'd better keep your bed two days longer.” “Pshaw! get me some proper clothes. I wish I had the pick of the surgeon's wardrobe, for, of a truth, Gray, I have but little choice of my own. I suspect my small clothes are of all colours, with the blood and dust of that last brush; but, no matter about the stains here and there; if you can only get me tolerably trim. I should rather be as unlike my popinjay rival as possible, on such an occasion.” The outlaw kept his resolution, in spite of all the exhortations of his comrade; and, that evening, surprised the family, and the surgeon, Hillhouse, not the least, by his sudden entry into the salle à manger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. A VISION. Edward Morton, could he have always kept his blood in abeyance, would have made a first rate politician. He had superior cunning, but he had, at the same time, too much earnestness. He yielded himself quite too much up to his subject. He could not tamper and trifle with it. His impetuosity defeated his caution; and, in every respect in which he failed, he could reproach himself only as the true cause of his failure. The stuff which he had expressed in conversation with Watson Gray, about the influence of fortune, did not deceive himself. He knew better, whenever he permitted himself to think gravely, and speak honestly; but men get into a habit of deceiving themselves while seeking to deceive others; and fortune has always been compelled to bear the whining reproaches of mankind whenever their own wits go a-blundering. Pride makes them unwilling to admit the fault to be in themselves, and fortune is a good-natured damsel, who seldom resents the imputations cast upon her. They clamour accordingly, and without fear, at her expense; and grow familiar with the language of unprofitable and unintended declamation. It scarcely needs that we should remark how unfrequently they make acknowledgments of her bounty. When successful, it is their own excellent art, audacious courage, admirable skill, and manly accomplishment, that achieves the conquest, and the smile which denotes their satisfaction with all the world, betrays first the gratifying conviction that they themselves are good against all the world. Edward Morton was by no means ignorant of his own defect of character. He knew his impetuosity of blood, and he feared it. It was necessary to guard particularly against that in all his intercourse with Flora Middleton. Of this he had previous experience. He knew her acuteness of intellect. The very simplicity of her own character, and the directness and almost masculine frankness of her temper, made it somewhat difficult to elude her analysis. Besides, she already suspected him. This he knew. He had every reason to suppose, in addition, that the late close intercourse between herself and Clarence Conway, however brief, had enabled the latter to afford her some information of the true state of their mutual feelings and interests. But, in due proportion with the small amount of knowledge which he possessed, was the reasonable apprehension which he entertained of the extent of what she knew. She might know much or little. He had every reason to fancy that she knew all; and his chief hope lay in the fruitful falsehoods which his wily coadjutor had taken occasion to plant within her mind. If those falsehoods had taken root—if they flourished—perhaps the difficulty would not be great to make her doubt all the assertions of his brother. “If she believes him this villain,—well! She will believe more. She will believe that he has slandered me —nothing can be more natural,—and if one task be well performed, it will not be hard to effect the other. But I VOL. II. 18 must be wary. She is as keen-eyed as a hungry eagle —looks far and deep. One hasty word—one incautious look,—and her sharp wit detects the error, and all must be begun anew. I must be cool now, or never. With every thing at stake, I must school my blood into subjection, if I have not already lost enough to make the pains-taking unnecessary.” Such were his thoughts, and such the hopes, upon which he founded his new purposes of deception. The surprise of all parties was great, and openly expressed, as he suddenly entered the supper-room. But the outlaw saw with pleasure that the surprise of the ladies did not seem coupled with any coldness or dissatisfaction. It has not been necessary for us to say, before, that Mrs. Middleton had visited the invalid in his chamber. She had done all the duties of hospitality and humanity. He had accordingly no cause of complaint. He could have no reason to expect the like attendance from the young lady; and the gentle courtesy of the latter would have convinced one even more suspicious than Morton, that she had no hostile feeling whatsoever, at work against him. The inquiries of both were kind and considerate. He was requested to occupy the sofa entirely, and to place himself at ease upon it; a permission which had the effect of transferring the reluctant person of the surgeon to a contiguous chair. The deportment of this person had been productive of far more surprise to the ladies, than the appearance of the outlaw. Flora Middleton had informed her grandmother of the suit which she had rejected, and it was, therefore, greatly to the wonder of the one, and the consternation of the other, that they were compelled to witness, in his deportment, the language of confident assurance;—of a success, and exultation, as unequivocal as ever betrayed themselves in the action of a triumphant lover. His smirkings were not to be mistaken; and the old lady looked to the young one, and the young one returned the glance with equal vexation and bewilderment. The arrival of Morton had the effect of bringing some relief to the females of the party, and possibly to diminish, in some degree, the impertinent self-complaisance of the surgeon. For this, the ladies were grateful to the outlaw; and hence, perhaps, the greater benignity of the reception which they bestowed upon the latter. But there was quite enough of pleasure manifest in the visage of Hillhouse, even after the coming of Morton; and when the first courtesies which followed his entrance were fairly ended, he took occasion to say something on the subject to this happy person. “Really, Mr. Hillhouse, I am surprised at the unusual degree of happiness which your countenance exhibits this evening. What is it makes you so peculiarly happy. Have you good news from the army. Is his lordship about to relieve you. Do you think of Charleston and the next Meschianza?” The surgeon simpered, smiled anew, and looked with most provoking empressement at Flora Middleton. Before he could frame the intricate and exquisite reply which he was meditating, that young lady availed herself of the occasion, to prove, as well she might, that she was no willing party to the peculiar happiness which his countenance expressed. “I thank you for that question, Mr. Conway,—I was about to make the same inquiry; for, really, I never saw a gentleman put on so suddenly the appearance of so much joy. I fancied that Mr. Hillhouse must have had a fairy gift, as, you know, happens to us all in childhood; and then again, I doubted, for there are reasons against such a notion. But, in truth, I knew not what to think, unless it be that it is surely no earthly joy which has produced, or could produce, so complete an expression of delight in the human face. I declare, Mr. Hillhouse, I should be glad for mamma's sake,—if for the sake of no one else, to know what it is that makes you so supremely happy. There's nothing pleases old people so much, you know, as the innocent pleasures of young ones.” “Ah, Miss Flora, do you then ask? It is, indeed, no earthly joy which has made me happy.” “You are then really happy?” said Conway. “Really, and in truth, I may say so. A dream—” “What! and is it a dream only? Well, I thought as much;” exclaimed Flora. “Nay, Miss Middleton, life itself, for that matter, is a sort of dream. But, in ordinary speech, mine is not a dream. I have had a vision—” “A vision!” exclaimed Conway. “A vision, sir!” said the old lady, putting on her spectacles, and looking around the room. “A vision! Do you see it now, Mr. Hillhouse. Where? What is it like?” The demand of Flora was made with all the girlish eagerness of one who really believed in the prophetic faculty of the present seer. “Yes, what is it like, Mr. Hillhouse,” asked the outlaw, “I am very curious to hear! a vision!” “Like!” exclaimed the surgeon, “Like! Like an opening of heaven upon me. A sudden revelation of delight, and the shape within is that of—a woman!” “Dear me!—only a woman!” exclaimed Morton, affectedly. “Only a woman, sir!” cried the surgeon with an air of profoundest gallantry;—“and what lovelier object can one see in this visible creation—upon the earth or in the sky—” “Or the waters under the earth.” “Nay, I'm not so deep in the world, Mr. Conway,” said the surgeon; “but when you ejaculate in wonder, sir, because my vision of unspeakable delight takes the shape of a young and beautiful woman—” “What's the colour of her eyes—and hair, Mr. Hillhouse?” was the interruption of Conway. “Give us now a just description, that we may judge for ourselves what sort of a taste you have in matters of beauty.” Hillhouse looked to Flora Middleton with an inquiring expression, which said, as plainly as a look could say— “Shall I?” The scorn and vexation of the maiden's countenance, at this mute, but obvious interrogation, was equally plain, but indescribable. She rose from her chair, as if about to leave the room, but the sudden, and hurried words of Edward Morton arrested her, with a new occasion for wonder, more legitimate than that which the surgeon entertained. “By heavens, Mr. Hillhouse, I too have a vision, and one far less lovely, I think, than yours. Pray, look to that door if you please. There was a strange visage at it but a moment ago. Look! Look!—a man, not a woman; and one not from Heaven, though in may be,—” Before the surgeon could reach the door, or Morton could finish the sentence, a dark figure entered the room, confronted the party, and taking from his face a black mask, with which it was covered, displayed to the anxious gaze of the outlaw his own late lieutenant, and always bitter enemy, Lieutenant Stockton. The latter had heard what Morton said, and concluded his speech, perhaps, in the most fitting manner. “From hell, you would say, would you! and you are right, sir. I came from hell, and I am come for you. You are prepared for travel, I trust!” The behaviour of Morton was equally fearless and dignified. He had a game to play in the eyes of Flora, and a difficult part to act in more eyes than hers. His agitation had not been concealed, at the first sudden exhibition which Stockton had made of his hostile visage at the entrance;—but when the person of the intruder was no longer doubtful, his firmness came back to him, and no man, on the verge of a precipice, could have looked down with more indifference than he, upon its awful abysses. He raised himself with composure from the sofa, and directing the eyes of Stockton to the ladies, camly remarked,— “Whatever you may be, and whatever your purpose, as a man, remember where you are, and be civil to the ladies.” He was answered by a grin, of mingled exultation and malice. “Ay! Ay! I will remember. Don't suppose I shall ever forget them, or yourself, or even that pink-looking gentleman in the corner, who smells so sweetly, and looks so frightened. Ha! Ha!—Did you ever know the devil to forget any of his flock. Ladies, you know me, or you should. You will know me soon enough. I am 18* old Nick, himself, be sure of that, though I go by several names. My most innocent one is perhaps the most familiar to you. I am the captain of the Black Riders. Do you deny that?” he demanded at the close, turning full upon Edward Morton. It did not need that the latter should answer this inquiry, for the alarm which this bold annunciation produced, prevented his words from being heard by any ears but those of the intruder. “You may be the devil, himself, for any thing I know, or care.” “Indeed! you are bold. But we shall see. You will find me a worse person to deal with perhaps. You are my prisoner. Remember that.” “I know not that!” exclaimed Morton, rising with evident pain from the sofa, upon which he had sunk but a minute before, and looking the defiance which he had no means to enforce. His attitude was, however, threatening; and, drawing a pistol from his belt, the intruder levelled it full at the head of his superior. The eye of Morton did not shrink. His gaze was undaunted. Not a muscle of his face was discomposed. At that instant Watson Gray suddenly entered the apartment, strode between them, and confronted Stockton with a weapon like his own. At the same time he thrust another into the hands of Morton. “There are two to play at this game, Stockton,” was the cool remark of Gray. “Ladies, leave the room, if you please. We need no witnesses; and you, sir, unless you can kill as well as cure, you may as well follow the ladies.” This was addressed to the surgeon. “I have no weapon;” was his answer. “Pshaw! look to the fireplace. A brave man never wants a weapon.” Hillhouse possessed himself of the poker with sufficient resolution; but he evidently looked with great dissatisfaction upon the prospect before him, of soiling his dove-colored suit in an unexpected melée. Meanwhile, the ladies had disappeared, and the only social influence which might have prevented bloodshed was necessarily removed in their departure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. A PARLEY. “What does all this mean, Stockton?” demanded Gray. “What you see. The meaning's plain enough, Watson Gray,” was the insolent reply. “Ay, I see well enough that you are disposed to murder your superior; but on what pretence? How will you answer to Lord Rawdon for this insubordination— this mutiny, for it is no less. Captain Morton has the commission of Sir Henry Clinton. He is your commander.” “Yes, but he is the property of the troop also.” “Well, what then. Suppose we allow that.” “That is enough. He is a traitor to them.” “Ha!—a traitor!” “Yes!—a base, dishonest traitor.” “How! In what way is he a traitor?” “He is sworn to be true to them.” “Well, if to be mangled in their battles is to be true to them, he certainly has been true a long time.” “But he is a traitor at last. He has sold them, and is about to desert them.” “This is a mere fetch, Stockton. There is no ground for such pretence. You are the enemy of Captain Morton. We all know that of old. You are contriving it against him to destroy him. Beware! You know me quite as well as I know you. I tell you, that if you go one inch on either hand from the right, your neck stretches on the gallows in the sight of all Charlestown.” “'Pshaw! Watson Gray! You don't hope to frighten me at this time of day with your ugly words. I know what I'm about. Captain Morton is a traitor to the troop, and we'll prove it. He is false to his oath, and will be made to answer all its penalties.” “That's well enough but what gives you the right, till the thing's proved, to lift pistol to his head.” “The thing's proved already.” “What! without a trial?” “We've two witnesses against him.” “Where are they? We'll hear them, not you. You are a little too fast.” “You shall hear both. You shall hear me too. I am now the captain of the troop. They have made me so by their free voices. He is nothing now, but one, under suspicion, and waits for his sentence.” “Look you! Stockton!—I'm better used to acting than talking. I know you of old, and I see you're bent to kill your captain, whether or no! You're hungering to step into his shoes: but the moment you pull trigger on him, that moment I pull trigger on you. There's two to one. Take your chance now for life; for I'm getting angry.” “Two to one, indeed! Look at the windows man, and you'll see twenty to one!” was the triumphant response of Stockton. Gray looked as he was bidden, so did the surgeon Hillhouse, but Morton kept his eyes fixed upon those of his lieutenant. “Well, do you see?—are you satisfied? There is no chance for you,” said the latter. “I see only what I expected to see;” was the answer of Gray. “I did not look to see you venture here without good backing. I knew you too well for that. These twenty men are enough to eat us up. But before you can get help from them, we'll make mince meat of you. You are a fool if you think otherwise.” Stockton looked upon his destined victim, with equal rage and disappointment. “What! you refuse then to surrender him to me?” “We do!” “Well, we shall see what we can do with a few more pistols,” replied the ruffian, and with these words he prepared to leave the room. But Gray placed himself between him and the entrance. “Stay,” said he, “not so fast. You've got into the canebrake with the bear. You must ask permission when you want to leave it.” “What! do you mean to keep me?” “Yes! you shall be a hostage for the rest. We must have terms between us, Richard Stockton, before we let you off.” “What terms?” demanded the other angrily. “Where's our guard?” “Fastened up in the log house, where they're all drunk.” “They must be released; and you must answer to Lord Rawdon for making his soldiers drunk and incapable, while on duty at a British military post.” “Who says I made them drunk?” “I say so.” “You cannot prove it.” “You shall see. If I can prove that one of your troopers did it, it will be necessary for you to show that you did not employ that trooper in doing it.” “Watson Gray, I will have satisfaction from you for this!” “All in good time, Stockton. You don't suppose that I'm likely to dodge from a difficulty with you or any man. But it's useless to ride your high horse across my path. By the Eternal, man, I'll tilt you into the ditch in the twinkle of a musquito.” “You talk boldly; but let me tell you that you're not altogether safe from this charge against Morton. You're suspected too of treason to the troop.” “Tsha, tsha, tsha!—Catch old birds with chaff! Look you, Stockton; don't you suppose you can carry this matter as you please, either by scare or shot. We're up to you any how. Now look you; if you think that either Captain Morton or myself want's to escape from trial, you're mistaken. But we'll have a fair trial or none at all.” “Well, won't we give him a fair trial?” “No: not if you begin it with the pistol.” “I only want to make him a prisoner.” “Well, you shan't have your wishes in that—not while I can stand ready with such a muzzle as this close upon yours. Now, hear me. Give orders to Ensign Darcy, whose little eyes I see dancing at that glass there, and who's at the bottom of all your mischief—give him orders to let our men loose from the loghouse, and send them here; and, in the mean time, let him draw his own men off from the house. When that's done, we'll come to terms about the trial.” “Agreed;” said the other, and he made a new movement as if to take his departure, but the wily Gray was still on the alert. “No! no!—my good fellow!—You must stay as a hostage, lieutenant, 'till the matter's all arranged. You can speak to Darcy from where you stand; through the pane as well as if your arm was round his neck.” The vexation of Stockton may be imagined. He strove vainly to suppress it. He was compelled to submit. Darcy was summoned, and would have entered with his men following him, but Watson Gray's prompt accents warned him, that, if he came not alone, he would bring down on the head of his confederate the bullets of himself and Morton. Sharing the chagrin of his superior, Darcy, accordingly, made his appearance alone, and received his instructions. When he had drawn off his followers and disappeared himself, Gray persuaded Morton to retire to his chamber with the assistance of the surgeon. This measure had, perhaps, become absolutely necessary to the former. The efforts which he had made to sustain himself, as well in the interview with the ladies, as in that unexpected one which followed it;—and the excitement which the latter necessarily occasioned, had nearly exhausted him. Nothing but the moral stimulus derived from his mind, its hate, scorn, defiance—sustained him so far from fainting on the spot; and this support did not support him much longer. He did faint when he reached his apartment. “And now, Stockton,” said Gray, when they were alone together—“what's all this d—d nonsense stuff about Captain Morton's treachery and mine? Out with it, man, that we may know the game.” “No nonsense stuff, I assure you. The proof is strong enough against him, and brushes your skirts also.” “Proof indeed. You see, I don't stop to let you know, lieutenant, that I look upon you as a man that will contrive, if you can, against the captain. I know that you hate him—you can't deny it,—though it's the strangest thing to me why you should hate a man who has never given you any cause for hate, and has always treated you well and kindly.” “Indeed! Do you really think so!” exclaimed the other bitterly. “Well, I shall understand, that, to knock a man over with the butt of your pistol, and send him afterwards under guard to prison, with a recommendation for the halberds, is a way to treat well and kindly. “Pshaw! Is that all!” “All! ay, and enough too!” “My good fellow, you ought to be grateful that he didn't set you a swinging from the first tree. I heard of that affair, and was sorry for it; but you deserved all you got and something more. He might have hung you without trial, or shot you down where you stood. You were in absolute mutiny!” “We'll say no more about that, Watson Gray. He's had his chance, and I'll have mine. So far from it being nonsense stuff which is against him, the proof is clear of his treachery.” “Well, prove it, and he must stand his fate. All he asks and all that I ask, is a fair trial. But what is the sort of treachery that he's been doing?” “Making arrangements to fly and leave the troop in the lurch. Getting boats to carry off the plate and negroes from Middleton Barony and other places, without letting the troop come to a share. You can't deny that's death by our laws—rope and bullet!” “Granted: but, again, I ask you, where's the proof!” “Brydone!—Ha! you start do you? You didn't expect that?” “Start!—a man may well start at hearing of such a falsehood from the lips of a fellow like Brydone, who was always counted one of the truest fellows we ever had.” “Yes; you didn't think he'd desert you, eh?” “Desert!—Look you, Stockton, I don't believe that Brydone ever said such a word. Did you hear him yourself?” “Yes—I did.” “Where is he? Bring him before me.” “Time enough. He's not here with us at present. But he'll be here sooner than you wish.” “Ah!”—and the scout paused, while his brow gathered into deep, dark folds which indicated the pressure of accumulating thoughts. He suddenly recovered his madness, and turning, with a quiet smile upon his more blunt companion, he proceeded:— “Stockton, I see your game. I need not tell you that I am now convinced that you have no such proof, and that Brydone never told you any thing hurtful to the captain. If so, didn't you know he was to have a fair trial?— Why didn't you bring your only witness? and did not you also know, that, by the laws, no one could be found guilty but by two witnesses. Now, you only speak of one—” “Ay, ay! but there's another, Watson Gray. Don't suppose I got so far ahead of common sense in this business as to stumble in that matter. No! no! I hate Ned Morton too much—too thoroughly and bitterly—to leave my desire of revenge to a doubtful chance. The whole matter was cut and dry before we came down from `Ninety-Six.' We have two witnesses of his guilt.” “Well, who's the other?” asked Gray with seeming indifference. “Isaac Muggs!” “What Isaac, the one-armed! But you don't call him a man, surely—he's only part of a man!” “You don't mean to stand for such an argument as that?” demanded Stockton gravely. “Oh, no!” responded the other with a laugh. “Let him go for what he's worth. But—”—here his indifference of manner seemed to increase as, yawning, he inquired— “But when are these witnesses to be here? When may we confront them?” “Sooner than you wish;” was the reply. “We look for Brydone to-morrow, by the dawn; and as for Isaac Muggs, we expect to catch him very soon after, if not before. We hope to be in readiness along the river banks, to see whether he brings up the boats which are fit to carry such a valuable cargo, as you've got ready here to put in them.” “Ah!—so you're got the Congaree under guard, have you?” demanded the other with the same seeming indifference of manner. “It will be somewhat difficult for him to find you without finding us;” replied Stockton with a chuckling sort of triumph. “So much for Isaac, then. I suppose he brings Brydone along with him?” was the carelessly expressed inquiry of Gray. “No! no! He will be more certain to arrive, and comes more willingly. Rawdon despatched him below with a letter to Colonel Stewart, at Fairlawn, and he will be here too soon for your liking. He comes by the road. Do not think we ventured upon this business without preparation. We made nice calculations and timed every thing to the proper moment. Brydone sleeps to-night at Martin's tavern, so we may expect him here by sunrise. We'll be ready, at all events, for the trial by twelve o'clock to-morrow. At least we can take his testimony and wait for Muggs. But I calculate on both before that time.” Watson Gray seemed for a moment lost in thought. His dark bushy brows were bent down almost to the concealment of his eyes. “It seems to worry you!” said Stockton with a sneer. “Worry me! No! no! Stockton, you're only worrying yourself. I was thinking of a very different matter,” replied the other with a good-natured smile. “Well, do you say that you'll be ready for the trial then?” VOL. II. 19 “We're ready now.—Ready always for fair play. But you must draw off your troop.” “Very well! I have no objections to that, for I can draw 'em on again at a moment's warning. If you don't keep faith you'll sweat for it. I'm agreed to any thing that don't prevent the trial. Where shall it be— Here?” “Here! Oh, no! To have your sixty men rushing upon us at close muzzle-quarters! No, no! We'll have it in the woods, near the river, where my half-score of muskets may be covered by the trees and be something of a match for your troop. Besides, the women, you know!” “Well, I'm willing. There's a clayey bluff just above, facing the river-bend. There's something of an opening, and I reckon it's a sort of graveyard. I see a new grave there and a cross upon it. Let the trial be there.” “A new grave and a cross upon it!” mused the other. —“That must be Mary Clarkson's grave, but the cross! —Ah! perhaps Miss Flora had that done. She's a good girl!—Well, I'm agreed. Let it be there—just at the turning of the sun at noon.” “Keep your word Gray, and the worst enemy of Ned Mortan—” “Yourself!” “The same!—His worst enemy can ask nothing more. If we don't convict him,—” “You'll swallow the Congaree!” “You may laugh now, but I doubt if you will to-morrow; and I know that Ned Morton will be in no humour to laugh, unless he does so because he likes dancing in air much better than most people.” “Well, well, Stockton;—we shall soon see enough. To-morrow's never a far day off, and here comes Darcy to relieve you. But as for your hanging Ned Morton, why, man, your own troop will hardly suffer it.” “Ha! will they not? Is that your hope?” said Stockton with an exulting sneer. “Perhaps!” replied the other with a smile. The entrance of Darcy arrested the conference.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. A WITNESS SILENCED. The business of the two had reached its close before the return of Darcy with the British guard which he had released. Some other matters were adjusted between them, and Lieutenant Stockton was, at length, permitted to depart; while Watson Gray, at the same moment, received from Darcy the still half drunken soldiery. It may be supposed that neither Stockton nor Darcy was altogether so well satisfied with the result of their expedition. The game was fairly in their hands; but the precipitation of Stockton, arising from a too great feeling of security and a desire to exult over his threatened victim, led to that exposure of his own person of which Watson Gray so readily availed himself. The reproaches of the subordinate were not spared. “But it comes to the same thing,” said Stockton. “He is still ours. He is pledged to appear at the trial.” “Ay, but suppose he does not come?” “Then the delay follows, and no worse evil. We have men enough surely to pull the old house about his ears.” “With the loss of half of them! A dear bargain,” replied the dissatisfied lieutenant. “Not so bad either. We can starve them out in three days. But there's no fear that Gray will not keep his word. They will come to the trial. They flatter themselves that we shall see nothing of Isaac Muggs, whom they've sent away, and I told them of no other witness than Brydone. I said nothing of that skulk, Joe Tanner. He and Brydone are enough, and knowing the absence of Muggs, they'll come boldly on the ground, and walk headlong into the trap we've set for them.” “It's well you've had that caution, Stockton; for, of a truth, you have so far played your cards most rashly. We've got desperate men to deal with, and that Watson Gray has a head that's equal to any other half dozen in my acquaintance. There was another matter that your proceeding spoiled.” “What was that?” “The gutting of the house.” “Oh! that follows of course.” “A bird in the hand, you know. They may have time now to hide the valuables.” “It will be a close hole that our boys can't creep into. Where they've gone we can follow. But there's no doubt, Darcy, that I've given up one chance which befriended us. It's only putting off for to-morrow what might have been done to-day. Our appetite will be only so much the keener for the delay. Did you see Miss Middleton?” “Ay—did I not!” replied Darcy. “Look you, Stockton, I stipulate for her. You must not think to swallow all—rank, revenge, riches—and still yearn for beauty. She must go to my share of the booty.” “Yours! Pooh, Darcy, what should give you an amorous tooth? Don't think of it, my good fellow. I've set my mind upon her. It's a part of my revenge. She's the game that's turned Ned Morton's head—it was to disgrace him before her that made me blunder—and unless I show him that she too is at my mercy, my triumph will be only half complete.” Darcy muttered something about the “lion's share,” and his muttering reminded Stockton that he was too valuable an assistant to be trifled with. “Pshaw!” he exclaimed, “let us not squabble about a woman. I don't care a shilling about her. But she's common stock, you know. It must be according to the will of the troop.” We forbear listening to other heads of their private arrangements. They proceeded to rejoin their men and to see about the disposition of their sentinels, in secrecy, along the banks of the river, wherever they thought it probable that a boat would effect a landing. They did not bestow a very close watch along the land side, or in the immediate neighbourhood of the house, for they well knew that Morton could not escape, in his present condition of feebleness, by any but a water conveyance. He was their chief object, and they regarded his fate as now unavoidable. The safety of the landlord, Muggs, it has been already seen, was secured by the persevering and sleepless efforts of his new comrade, John Bannister. When the latter had swam the river, and joined him on the other side, the two laid themselves quietly down to sleep in a place of security, having resolved to get up at an early hour, before dawn, and, urging their boat up stream with united paddles, keep on the same side of the river until they could, without detection, cross to that on which the enemy lay. Their aim was to reach a point above the usual landing places of the barony, and out of the reach, accordingly, of the line of sentinels, each of which John Bannister had beheld where he was placed. The worthy scout was resolved to do all that he might, at any risk, for the safety of Flora; and for her rescue from the ruthless villains by whom her house was surrounded. He did not conjecture the state of affairs between the former captain of the Black Riders and his troop; and did not fancy that there was any cause of apprehension for the fate of Edward Conway, though such a conviction would have given him but little uneasiness. At the appointed hour he awakened his companion, struck a light, reloaded his rifle, the flint of which he carefully examined; and, having put himself and Muggs in as good condition for a conflict as possible, he shoved his canoe up the stream. The work was hard, but they achieved it. They plied their paddles vigorously, until they were enabled, with the help of the current, to round the jutting headland where slept the remains of Mary Clarkson. They had scarcely pulled into shore when they were startled by the sudden rising of a human figure from the earth, out of the bosom of which, and almost at their feet, he seemed to emerge. Bannister pushed back from the shore, but the friendly voice of Jake Clarkson reassured him. He had effected his escape, in the general drunkenness of the soldiery, though how that had been brought about the could tell but little. Those who had drugged their cups had evidently confounded him with the rest, 19* for they furnished him with a portion of the potent beverage also. Of this he drank nothing, and the consequence of his sobriety was his successful effort to escape. In the darkness he had been enabled to feel his way to the spot where his daughter slept. He could give no farther explanation; nor did Bannister annoy him on the subject. He was content with the acquisition of a stout fellow, whose aim was deadly, and who had contrived to secure his rifle from loss in all his several mischances. That he still carried upon his arm, and Bannister contented himself with instructing him to get it in readiness. “See to the flint and priming, daddy Jake, for the time's a-coming when I wouldn't have you miss fire for the best pole-boat on the Congaree.” If there was toil among these honest fellows, and among the outlaws in the neighbourhood of whose camp they were hovering, there was toil and anxiety also in the dwelling, to which, though with different feelings, the eyes of both these parties were directed. Sleepless and prayerful were the hours which the fair ladies of the mansion passed after that wild and fearful interruption which they experienced in the progress of the evening meal. But, in the chamber of Edward Morton, a more stern and immovable sentiment of apprehension prevailed to increase the gloom of his midnight watch, and to darken the aspects of the two who sat there in solemn conference. Watson Gray, though he naturally strove to infuse a feeling of confidence into the mind of his superior, could not, nevertheless, entirely divest his thoughts of the sombre tinge which they necessarily took from his feelings, in considering the events which the coming day was to bring forth. There was something excessively humbling to a man like Edward Morton in the idea of ever being tried for treachery by those whom he had so often led;—and to be placed for judgment before one whom he so heartily despised as Stockton, was no small part of the annoyance. The assurances which Watson Gray gave him did not touch this part of his disquietude. The simple conviction of his ultimate release could not materially lessen the pang which he felt at what he conceived to be the disgrace of such a situation. “Life or death, Gray,” he said, “is after all a trifling matter. I have the one here;” touching the hilt of a dirk which he had just placed within his bosom, “or here,” and his fingers rested on the handle of the pistol which lay beside him on the bed. “Either of these will secure me from the indignity which this base scoundrel would delight to fasten upon me; and, as for life, I believe I love it no more than any other soldier who knows the condition of the game he plays and the value of the stake he lays down. But, to be hauled up and called to answer to such a scamp, for such a crime, is, really, a most shocking necessity. Can't we mend the matter no way? Can't we tamper with some of the men? There are a few whom you could manage. There's Butts, both the Maybins, Joe Sutton, Peters, and half a dozen more that were always devoted to me, though, perhaps, among the more timid of the herd. If you could manage these; if you could persuade them to join us here, with your bull-head British allies, we should be able to make fight, and finish the copartnership in that manlier way. By Heaven, I'm stirred up with the notion! You must try it! I shall be strong enough for any thing when the time comes; and I feel, that in actual conflict with that villain Stockton, I could not help but hew him to pieces. Bring us to this point, Gray! Work, work, man, if you love me! If your wits sleep, wake them. Now or never! Let them save me from this d—nable situation and bitter shame.” The confederate shook his head despondingly. “No doubt if we could get at these fellows, or any half dozen in the troop, they might be bought over or persuaded in some way to desert to us;—but, do you not see that the difficulty is in getting at them? Were I to venture among them I should be served just as I served Stockton to-night. I should be hampered hand and foot, with no such chance of making terms of escape as he had. No, captain, I see no way to avoid the trial. You must make up your mind to that. But, I don't see that you will have any thing more to apprehend. Muggs is out of the way, and won't be back for three days. He's safe. One witness is not enough, and as for Brydone—” “D—n him! D—n him! The double-dyed traitor! And he was paid so well too!” “That was the mistake, I'm thinking. He got too much for that last business. He considered it the last job you'd ever give him, and he immediately cast about for a new employer. He's got him, but I do not think he'll keep him long.” “May they cut each other's throats!” was the devout prayer of the outlaw, to which Gray responded with a deliberate “Amen!” What was farther said, between the two, that night, was of the same temper and concerned the same business. Their hopes and fears, plans and purposes, so far as Watson Gray deemed it essential that his principal should know them, underwent, as it was natural they should, a prolonged examination. But Gray felt that the outlaw would need all his strength for whatever events might follow, and determined, therefore, upon leaving him to repose. Besides, he had some schemes working in his mind, which he did not declare to his principal, and which it was necessary that he should discuss entirely to himself. He had already taken care that his score of men, by this time quite sobered, should be strictly cautioned on the subject of their watch for the night, and so placed, within the dwelling, as to baffle any attempt at surprise or assault from without. The soldiers did not now need much exhortation to vigilance. They had already had some taste of the fruits of their misbehaviour, as in their beastly incapability of resentment, the outlaws had amused themselves with a rough pastime at their expense, in which cuffs and kicks were the most gentle courtesies to which the victims were subjected. This done, Gray summoned the surgeon, Hillhouse, to a brief conference, and assigned to him certain duties of the watch also. Though a frivolous, foolish person, he was temperate, and the chief object of Gray was to keep the soldiers from any excess during an absence which, it seems, he meditated, but which he did not declare to them. It was only necessary to intimate to Mr. Hillhouse what havoc the Black Riders would make, if they could once lay hands upon his variegated wardrobe, to secure all the future vigilance of that gentleman. All matters being arranged to his satisfaction, he stole forth at midnight from the mansion, none knowing and none suspecting his departure; and, with the practised arts of a veteran scout, he contrived to take from the stables the fleetest horse which they contained. Him he led, as quietly as he could, into the woods which lay to the west, and remote equally from the encampment and sentinels of the Black Riders. Their watch was maintained, with strictness, only on the river side; and, uninterrupted, Gray soon succeeded in placing himself in full cover of the forests, and out of the neighbourhood of the enemy's sentinels. He kept within the cover of the woods only so long as sufficed for safety; then, hurrying into the main road, he pursued his way down the country, at a rapid canter. The object of Watson Gray, in part, may be conjectured, by a recurrence to that portion of the dialogue which he had with Stockton, in which the latter accounted for the absence of Brydone, the most important witness, whom he could array against the fidelity of Captain Morton. He determined to go forth, meet Brydone, and bribe, or dissuade him from his meditated treachery. He had, if the reader will remember, wormed out of the less acute and subtle Stockton, the cause of Brydone's absence; the route which he would take, and the probable time of his arrival in the morning. To keep him back from the approaching trial he believed to be more important than he allowed to appear to Morton. He knew that their enemies would not be able to secure the testimony of Muggs, the landlord, within the allotted time; even if they succeeded, finally, in securing his person;—and he did not doubt that Stockton was prepared with some other witness, of whom he said nothing, in order the more effectually to delude the defendant into the field. This was, indeed, the case, as we have already seen from the conference between Stockton and his more subtle confederate, Darcy. “At all events,” solioquized the scout, “at all events, it will be the safe policy to keep Brydone out of the way. I must send him on another journey. He sleeps at Martin's tavern. Let me see:—Martin's is but fourteen miles. He can ride that at a dog-trot in three hours. He will probably start at daylight, and calculate to take his breakfast at the barony. That is Stockton's calculation. I must baffle them. Brydone must put off eating that breakfast.” Watson Gray did not continue his horse at the same pace at which he started. He drew up, after the first five miles, and suffered him to trot and walk alternately. He had not gone more than seven, when day broke upon the forests, and the keen eyes of the scout were then set to their best uses, as he surveyed the road upon which he travelled. By the time the sun rose he had gone quite as far as he intended. It was not a part of his policy to be seen at Martin's tavern; or seen at all, by any one, who might reveal the fact hereafter that he had gone upon the same road over which Brydone was expected. No man was better able to foresee, and provide against all contingencies, than Watson Gray. His every step was the result of a close calculation of its probable effects for good and evil. He quietly turned into the woods, when he had reached a thicket which promised him sufficient concealment for his purposes. Here he re-examined his pistols, which were loaded, each, with a brace of bullets. He stirred the priming with his finger, rasped the flints slightly with the horn handle of his knife, and adjusted the weapons in his belt for convenient use. He did not dismount from his saddle, but took care to place himself in such a position, on the upper edge of the thicket, as to remain unseen from below; while, at the same time, the path was so unobstructed from above as to permit him to emerge suddenly, without obstruction from the undergrowth, at any moment, into the main track. In this position he was compelled to wait something longer than he had expected. But Watson Gray, in the way of business, was as patient as the grave. He was never troubled with that fidgety peevishness which afflicts small people, and puts them into a fever, unless the winds rise from the right quarter at the very moment when they are desired to blow. He could wait, not only without complaint or querulousness; but, he prepared himself to wait, just as certainly as to perform. To suffer and to endure, he had sufficient common sense philosophy to perceive, was equally the allotment of life. On this occasion, he waited fully two hours, with no greater sign of discontent, than could be conjectured from his occasionally transferring his right and then his left leg from the stirrup to the pommel of his saddle, simply to rest the members, as they happened to be more or less stiffened by the want of exercise. All the while, his eyes keenly pierced the thicket below him, and his ears pricked up like his steed's, which he also cautiously watched, with the habitual readiness of a practised woodman. At length the tedium of his situation was relieved. The tramp of a horse was heard at a small distance, and as the traveller came up to the thicket, Watson Gray quietly rode out beside him. “Ha! Watson Gray!” exclaimed the new comer, who was the person expected. “The same, Joe Brydone,” was the answer of Gray, in tones which were gentle, quiet, and evidently intended to soothe the alarm of the other, which was clearly conveyed in his faltering accents, and in the sudden movement of his bridle hand, which made his steed shy off to the opposite side of the road. If his object was flight, it did not promise to be successful, for the powerful and fleet animal bestrode by Gray left him no hope to escape by running from his unwelcome companion. This he soon saw, and, encouraged perhaps by the friendly accents of Gray's voice, was content to keep on with him at the same pace which he was pursuing when they encountered. But his looks betrayed his disquiet. He had all the misgivings of the conscious traitor, apprehensive for his treasonable secret. On this head Gray did not leave him very long in doubt. “I've been looking for you, Brydone.” “Ah! why,—what's the matter.” “Yes!—you're expected at the barony.” “I know:—I'm on my way there now.” “Ned Morton expects you!” “Who: the Captain?” with some surprise. “Yes! a base charge is made against him by that scoundrel Stockton, and he wants you to disprove it.” “What's that?” demanded the other. “Why, neither more nor less, than that the Captain has been making preparations to desert the troop, in violation of his oath.” “Well, but Gray, that's the truth, you know;” said Brydone with more confidence. “How! I know!—I know nothing about it.” “Why, yes you do. Didn't you send me yourself to Isaac Muggs, and tell me what to say and do?” “Brydone, you're foolish. If I sent you, didn't I pay you for going; and isn't it a part of our business that you should keep the secret if you keep the money? You got paid for going, and got paid for keeping the secret; and now we expect you to go up and prove this fellow Stockton to be a liar and an ass.” “I can't do it, Gray,” said the other, doggedly. “And why not? There are more guineas to be got where the last came from.” “I don't know that,” was the reply. “But you shall see. I promise you twenty guineas, if you will swear to the truth, as I tell it to you, on this trial.” “I can't, Gray. I've told the truth already to Captain Stockton, and to more than him.” “But you were under a mistake, Brydone, my good fellow. Don't be foolish now. You will only be making a lasting enemy of Captain Morton, who has always been your friend, and who will never forget your treachery, if you appear in this business against him.” “His enmity won't count for much when they've tried him, Gray. He must swing.” “But mine will count for something. Would you be making an enemy of me, also? If you go forward and swear against him, you swear against me too.” “I can't help it—it's the truth.” “But where's the necessity of telling the truth at this time of day? What's the use of beginning a new business so late in life? You've told Stockton, it seems; go forwards then, and downface him that you never told him a word on the subject, and I will be your security for twenty guineas.” “I can't;—I told Lieutenant Darcy also, and several others.” “Ah! that's bad—that's very bad. My dear Brydone, that's unfortunate for all of us.” “I don't see how its unfortunate for more than him;” said Brydone, with recovered coolness. “Why yes, it's a loss to you; a loss of money, and, perhaps, something as valuable. But there's yet a way how you may mend it, and prevent the loss. You shall have the twenty guineas, if you'll just take the back track down the country, and be gone for five days. I don't care where you go, or what you do in the mean time, so that you don't come within twenty miles of the barony.” “I can't think of it,” said the other obstinately. Watson Gray regarded him earnestly, for a few moments, before he continued. “How a fellow of good sense will sometimes trifle with his good fortune, and risk every thing on a blind chance. Joe Brydone, what's got into you, that you can't see the road that's safest and most profitable?” “Perhaps I do;” replied the other with a grin of the coolest self-complaisance. He was answered by a smile of Gray, one of that sinister kind which an observing man would shudder to behold in the countenance of a dark, determined one. “Brydone,” he said, “let me give you some counsel, —the last, perhaps, I shall ever give you. You're in the way of danger if you go to the barony. There will be hot fighting there to-day. Captain Morton's friends won't stand by and see him swing, to please a cowardly scamp like Stockton. You can save yourself all risk, and a good share of money besides, by taking the twenty guineas, and riding down the road.” “Ah, ha! Gray!—but what would be my share at the gutting of the barony?” “The share of a fool, perhaps, whose fingers are made use of to take the nuts from the fire.” VOL. II. 20 “No more fool than yourself, Watson Gray; and let me tell you to look to yourself as well as the Captain. There's more halters than one in preparation.” “Ah! do you say so?” replied Gray, coolly, as the other jerked up the bridle of his horse, and prepared to ride forward. “Yes! and I warn you that you had better take the road down the country, rather than me. Your chance isn't so much better than that of Ned Morton, that you can stand by and see him hoisted, without running a narrow chance of getting your own neck in the noose. Now, take my word, you've given me what you call good advice; I'll give you some in return. Do just what you wanted me to do. Turn your horse's head, and ride down the country, and don't trust yourself within a day's ride of the barony. By hard pushing you'll get to Martin's in time for breakfast, while I'll ride for'ad and take mine at the barony.” “You are very considerate, Joe—very. But I don't despair of convincing you, by the sight of the twenty guineas. Gold is so lovely a metal, that a handful of it persuades where all human argument will fail; and I think, that, by giving you a sufficient share of it to carry, you will stop long enough, before you go on with this cruel business. You certainly can't find any pleasure in seeing your old friends hung; and when it's to your interest, too, that they should escape, it must be the worst sort of madness in you to go forward.” “You may put it up. I won't look. I tell you what, Watson Gray, I know very well what's locked up in Middleton barony. I should be a pretty fool to take twenty guineas, when I can get two hundred.” Meantime, under the pretence of taking the money from his bosom, Gray had taken a pistol from his belt. This he held in readiness, and within a couple of feet from the head of Brydone. The latter had pushed his horse a little in the advance, while Gray had naturally kept his steed in, while extricating the pistol. “Be persuaded, Brydone:” continued Gray, with all the gentleness of one who was simply bent to conciliate, “only cast your eyes round upon this metal, and you will be convinced. It is a sight which usually proves very convincing.” But the fellow doggedly refused to turn his head, which he continued to shake negatively. “No! no!” he answered, “it can't convince me, Watson Gray. You needn't to pull out your purse and waste your words. Put up your money. I should be a blasted fool to give up my chance at Middleton barony, and Ned Morton's share, for so poor a sum as twenty guineas.” “Fool!” exclaimed Gray, “then die in your folly! Take lead, since gold won't suit you;” and with the words, he pulled trigger, and drove a brace of bullets through the skull of his wilful companion. Brydone tumbled from his horse without a groan. “I would have saved the ass if he would have let me,” said Gray, dismounting leisurely; and, fastening his own and the horse of the murdered man in the thicket, he proceeded to lift the carcass upon his shoulder. He carried it into the deepest part of the woods, a hundred yards or more from the road side, and, having first emptied the pockets, he cast it down into the channel of a little creek, the watery ooze of which did not suffice to cover it. The face was down-wards, but the back of his head, mangled and shattered by the bullets, remained upward and visible through the water. From the garments of Brydone he gleaned an amount in gold almost as great as that which he had tendered him; and, with characteristic philosophy, he thus soliloquized while he counted it over and transferred it to his own pockets. “A clear loss of forty guineas to the foolish fellow. This is all the work of avarice. Now, if his heart hadn't been set upon gutting the barony, he'd have seen the reason of every thing I said to him. He'd have seen that it was a short matter of life and death between us. Him or me! Me or him! Turn it which way you will, like `96,'[3] [3] The two numbers which compose the name of the old State district of Ninety-Six, expressing the same quantity when viewed on either side, suggested to one of the members of the legislature a grave argument for continuing the name, when a change was contemplated—and effected—for that section of country. A better argument for its preservation was to be found in the distinguished share which it had in the Revolutionary struggle. it's still the same. I don't like to use bullets when other arguments will do: but 'twas meant to be so. He wasn't to listen to arguments this time, and I was to shoot him. He was a good runner, and that's as much as could be said of him; but a most conceited fool! Well, our reckoning's over. He's got his pay and discharge, and Stockton's lost his witness. I was fearful I'd have to shoot him, when I set out. The foolish fellow! He wouldn't have believed it if I had told him. With such a person feeling is the only sort of believing; a bullet's the only thing to convince a hard head. He's got it, and no more can be said.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. A SEQUEL TO AN EVIL DEED. The probable and ultimate task which Watson Gray had assigned to himself, for performance, on quitting the barony that morning, was fairly over; but the murderer, by this sanguinary execution, did not entirely conclude the bloody work which he had thus unscrupulously begun. He was one of those professional monsters, whose brag it is that they make a clean finish of the job, and leave behind them no telltale and unnecessary chips which they might readily dispose of out of sight. He had no scruples in pocketing the money which he had taken from the garments of Brydone; but he knew that the horse of the murdered man could be identified, and, accordingly, though with much more reluctance than he had manifested in the case of his master, he decreed to the animal the same fate. He brought him to the spot where he had thrown the body, and despatched him in like manner, by putting a brace of bullets through his head. Then, with all the coolness of the veteran ruffian, he reloaded his weapons where he stood, and, having done so, returned to the spot where his own steed had been fastened. But the report of his last pistol had awakened other echoes than such as were altogether desirable; and he, who had so lately sent his fellow-creature to his sudden and fearful account, was soon aroused to the necessity of seeking measures for his own life and safety. He had left the plain which he had made memorable by his evil deed, not more than half a mile behind him, when he was startled by the mellow note of a bugle in his rear. A faint answer was returned from above; and he now began to fear that his path was beset by cavalry. Could it be that Stockton had got some intimation of his departure from the barony, and, suspecting his object, had set off in pursuit? This was the more obvious interpretation of the sounds which alarmed him. This was the most natural suspicion of his mind. He stopped his horse for a few seconds on the edge of the road, and partly in the cover of the wood; undetermined whether to dismount and take the bushes, or boldly dash forward and trust to the fleetness of his steed. But for the difficulty of hiding the animal, the former would have been the best policy. He chose a middle course and rode off to the left, into the forest, at as easy a pace as was possible. But he had not gone a hundred yards before he espied the imperfect outlines of three horsemen in a group, on the very line he was pursuing. They were at some distance, and did not, probably, perceive him where he stood. Drawing up his reins, he quietly turned about, and endeavoured to cross the road in order to bury himself in the woods opposite; but, in crossing, he saw and was seen by at least twenty other horsemen. The brief glimpse which was afforded him of these men showed him that they were none of Stockton's; but did not lessen, in any degree, his cause of apprehension, or the necessity of his flight. The pale yellow crescent which gleamed upon their caps of felt or fur, and their blue uniforms, apprised him that 20* they were the favourite troopers of Clarence Conway; and the wild shout which they set up at seeing him, too plainly told the eagerness with which they were resolved to dash upon their prey. Gnashing his teeth in the bitterness of his disappointment, he growled, in loud soliloquy, as he drove the spurs into his charger's sides, and sent him headlong through the woods. “Hell's curses on such luck. Here, when all was as it should be, to have him cross the track. It will be too late to get back to the captain!” At this time, the apprehensions of Watson Gray seemed entirely given to his superior. The idea of his own escape being doubtful, did not once seem to cross his mind. He looked up to the sun, which was now speeding rapidly onwards to his meredian summits, and muttered,— “Eight good miles yet, and how many twists and turns beside, the d—l only knows! Would to Heaven that Stockton would only come into the woods now. There could be no more pretty or profitable game for us, than to see his rascals, and these, knocking out each other's brains. Where the deuse did Conway spring from? He's after Stockton, that's clear; but what brought him below? Not a solitary scoundrel of a runner in all last week, to tell us any thing—no wonder when we knock our skulls against the pine trees.” Such were his murmurings as he galloped forwards. The pursuit was begun with great spirit, from several quarters at the same time; betraying a fact which Gray had not before expected, and which now began to awaken his apprehensions for his own safety. He was evidently environed by his foes. There had been an effort made to surround him. This, he quickly conjectured to have been in consequence of the alarm which he himself had given, by the use of firearms, in his late performances. “So much for firing that last pistol. It was not needful. What did I care if they did find the horse afterwards. Nobody could trouble me with the matter. But it's too late for wisdom. I must do the best. I don't think they've closed me in quite.” But they had. The very first pistol-shot had been reported to Conway by one of his scouts, and the troop had been scattered instantly, with orders to take a wide circuit, and contract to a common centre, around the spot whence the alarm had arisen. The second shot quickened their movements, and their object was facilitated by the delay to which Gray was subjected in the removal of the body of Brydone, and in the search which he afterwards made of the pockets of his victim. He soon saw the fruits of his error—of that which is scarcely an error in a sagacious scout—that Indian caution which secures and smooths every thing behind him, even to the obliteration of his own footsteps. He had ridden but a few hundred yards farther, when he discovered that the foe was still in front of him. Two of the “Congaree Blues,” well mounted and armed, were planted directly in his track, and within twenty paces of each other. Both were stationary, and seemed quietly awaiting his approach. A desperate fight, or a passive surrender were only to be avoided by a ruse de guerre. The chances of the two former seemed equally dubious. Watson Gray was a man of brawn, of great activity and muscle. He would not have thought it a doubtful chance, by any means, to have grappled with either of the foes before him. He would have laughed, perhaps, at the absurdity of any apprehensions which might be entertained in his behalf, in such a conflict. But with the two, the case was somewhat different. The one would be able to delay him sufficiently long to permit the other to shoot, or cut him down, at leisure, and without hazard. Surrender was an expedient scarcely more promising. The Black Riders had long since been out of the pale of mercy along the Congaree; and the appeal for quarter, on the part of one wearing their uniform, would have been answered by short shrift and sure cord. But there was a ruse which he might practise, and to which he now addressed all his energies. He lessened the rapidity of his motion, after satisfying himself by a glance behind him, that he was considerably in advance of the rear pursuit. He was now sufficiently nigh to those in front to hear their voices. They charged him to surrender as he approached; and, with a motion studiously intended for them to see, he returned the pistol to his belt, which before he had kept ready in his hand. This was a pacific sign, and his reply to the challenge confirmed its apparent signification. “Good terms—good quarter—and I'll surrender;” was his reply. “Ay, ay!—you shall have terms enough,” was the answer; and the young dragoon laughed aloud at the seeming anxiety with which the fugitive appeared to insist upon the terms of safety. Gray muttered between his teeth— “He means good rope; but he shall laugh t'other side of his mouth, the rascal!” Maintaining an appearance studiously pacific, and giving an occasional glance behind him, as if prompted by terror, Gray took especial care to carry his horse to the right hand of the farthest trooper, who was placed on the right of his comrade, and, as we have said, some twenty paces from him. By this movement he contrived to throw out one of the troopers altogether, the other being between Watson Gray and his comrade. Approaching this one he began drawing up his steed, but when almost up, and when the dragoon looked momentarily to see him dismount, he dashed the spurs suddenly into the animal's sides, gave him free rein, and adding to his impetus by the wildest halloo of which his lungs were capable, he sent the powerful steed, with irresistible impulse, full against the opposing horse and horseman. The sword of the trooper descended, but it was only while himself and horse were tumbling to the ground. A moment more, and Watson Gray went over his fallen opponent with a bound as free as if the interruption had been such only as a rush offers to the passage of the west wind. But a new prospect of strife opened before his path almost the instant after. One and another of Conway's troop appeared at almost every interval in the forest, the pursuing party were pressing forward with wild shouts of rage and encouragement from behind, and a darker feeling, and far more solemn conviction of evil, now filled the mind of the outlaw. “A life's only a life, after all. It's what we all have to pay one day or another. I don't think I shortened Joe Brydone's very much, and if the time's come to shorten mine, I reckon it wouldn't be very far off any how. As for the captain, he don't know, and he'll be blaming me, but I've done the best for him. It's only on his account I'm in this hobble. I could easily have managed Stockton on my own. Well, neither of us knows who's to be first; but the game looks as if 'twas nearly up for me. It won't be the rope though, I reckon. No! No! I'm pretty safe on that score.” The dark impressions of his mind found their utterance, in this form, in the few brief moments that elapsed after the discovery of his new enemy. They did not seem disposed to await his coming forward, as had been the case with the dragoon whom he had foiled and overthrown. They were advancing briskly upon him from every side. He would willingly have awaited them without any movement, but for the rapidly sounding hoofs in the rear. These drove him forward; and he derived a new stimulus of daring, as he discovered among the advancing horsemen the person of Clarence Conway himself. Watson Gray had imbibed from his leader some portion of the hate which the latter entertained, to a degree so mortal, for his more honourable and fortunate brother. Not that he was a man to entertain much malice. But he had learned to sympathize so much with his confederate in crime, that he gradually shared his hates and prejudices, even though he lacked the same fiery passions which would have provoked their origination in himself. The sight of Clarence Conway aroused in him something more than the mere desire of escape. Of escape, indeed, he did not now think so much. But the desire to drag down with him into the embrace of death an object of so much anxiety and hate, and frequent vexation, was itself a delight; and the thought begat a hope in his mind, which left him comparatively indifferent to all the dangers which might have threatened himself. He saw Conway approaching, but he did not now wait for his coming. To remain, indeed, was to subject him to the necessity of throwing away his resources of death and of defence, upon the less worthy antagonists who were closing up from behind. Accordingly, drawing both pistols from his belt, he dropped the reins of his horse upon his neck, and gave him the spur. “Beware!” cried Conway to the troopers around him, as he saw this action—“the man is desperate.” He himself did not seem to value the caution which he expressed to others. He dashed forward to encounter the desperate man, his broadsword waving above his head, and forming, in their sight, the crescent emblem of his followers. With loud cries they pressed forward after his footsteps; but the splendid charger which Conway bestrode, allowed them no chance of interposition. The resolute demeanour, and reckless advance of Conway, probably saved his life. It drew the precipitate fire of Watson Gray, and probably disordered his aim. The bullet shattered the epaulette upon Conway's shoulder, and grazed the flesh, but scarcely to inflict a wound. Before he could use the second, a henchman of Conway's, a mere boy, rode up, and shivered the hand which grasped it by a shot, almost sent at hazard, from a single and small pistol which he carried. In another moment the sweeping sabre of Conway descended upon the neck of the outlaw, cutting through the frail resistance of coat and collar, and almost severing the head from the shoulders. The eyes rolled wildly for an instant—the lips gasped, and slightly murmured, and then the insensible frame fell heavily to the earth, already stiffened in the silent embrace of death. The space of time had been fearfully short between his own fate, and that which the murderer had inflicted upon Brydone. His reflections upon that person, may justify us in giving those which fell from the lips of Clarence Conway, as the victim was identified. “Watson Gray!” said he, “a bad fellow, but a great scout. Next to John Bannister, there was not one like him on the Congaree. But he was a wretch—a bad, bloody wretch;—he's gone to a dread and terrible account. Cover him up, men, as soon as you have searched him. Lieutenant Monk, attend to this man's burial, and join me below. We must see what he has been about there. You say two pistol shots were heard?” “Two, sir, about ten minutes apart.” “Such a man as Watson Gray, never uses firearms without good cause—we must search and see.” Dividing his little force, Conway gave the order to “trot,” and the troop was soon under quick motion, going over the ground which they so recently traversed. The search was keen, and as we may suppose, successful. The body of Brydone and that of his horse were found, but as he was unknown, it excited little interest. That he was a Black Rider, and an enemy, was obvious from his dress; and the only subject of marvel was, why Watson Gray should murder one of his own fraternity. It was midday before Clarence Conway took up the line of march for Middleton Barony, and this mental inquiry was one for which he could find no plausible solution until some time after he had arrived there. Let us not anticipate his arrival.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. BUCKLING ON ARMOUR. It may readily be supposed that the disappearance of Watson Gray caused some uneasiness in the mind of his principal; but when, hour after hour elapsed, yet brought neither sign nor word which could account for his absence, or remedy its evil consequences, the uneasiness of the outlaw naturally and proportionately increased. The fearful hour was speeding onwards to its crisis, as it seemed, with more than wonted rapidity of time. The aspect of events looked black and threatening. Wounded and feeble, wanting in that agent who, in his own prostration, was the eye, and the wing, and the arm, of his resolves, Edward Morton could not shake off the gathering clouds of apprehension which hung heavy about his soul. He had risen at the first blushing of the day, and, with the assistance of a servant, contrived to put on his garments. The sword which he was scarcely able to wield,—certainly, with no efficiency—was buckled to his side;—but his chief reliance, in the event of a last struggle, lay in his pistols, of which an extra pair had been provided by Watson Gray, the moment he discovered the probable danger of his superior. As the day advanced, and Gray did not appear, the outlaw felt it necessary to make those preparations, the chief duty of which now promised to devolve upon him; and with some difficulty, descending to the lower story of the house, he proceeded to drill his men in anticipation of the worst. He had already resolved not to go further, unless Gray made his appearance in season and counselled the measure. He had, from the first, been opposed to the trial; though he could not but acknowledge that the arrangement had been most favourable, at the time, which his confederate could hope to make. He was now more thoroughly confirmed than ever in his determination to keep his defences, and convert the mansion house into a strong hold, which he would surrender only with his life. The surgeon, Hillhouse, was present, with a double share of resolution, to second his resolve. The picture which Watson Gray had judiciously presented to his mind, the night before, of the sacking of his various wardrobe, by the sable mutineers, had been a subject of sleepless meditation to him the whole night, and had imbued him with a bitter disposition, to kill and destroy, all such savage levellers of taste and fortune as should cross his path or come within shooting distance from the windows. His person was decorated with more than usual care and fastidiousness that morning. He wore a rich crimson trunk, that shone like flame even in the darkened apartments. This was tapered off with stockings of the softest lilac; and the golden buckles which glittered upon his shoes, also served to bring “a strange brightness to the shady place.” His coat, worn for the first time since he had reached the barony, was of the rich uniform of the British Guards. Altogether, Surgeon Hillhouse, in his present equipments, made a most imposing figure. His person was not bad, though his face was monstrous ugly; and he possessed a leg which was symmetry itself. He measured at annual periods, the knee, the calf, and the ankle, and by a comparison with every other handsome leg in the army, he had been able to satisfy himself that his was the perfect standard. It did not lessen the military effect of his appearance, though somewhat incongruous with his display in other respects, that he wore a common belt of sable strapped about his waist, in which were stuck half a dozen pistols of all sizes. He had a taste in this weapon, and had accumulated a moderate assortment, most of which were richly wrought and inlaid with bits of embossed plate, of gold and silver; carvings and decorations, which took the shapes of bird, beast, and flower, according to the caprice or fancy of their owner; or, it may be, the artist himself. The more serious and stern outlaw met this display with a look of scorn which he did not seek to suppress, but which the fortunate self-complaisance of the other did not suffer him to see. “You don't seem, Mr. Hillhouse,” he observed, as they met, “to anticipate much trouble or danger in this morning's work.” “Ah sir! and why do you think so?” demanded the other with some curiosity. “Your garments seem better adapted for the ballroom and the dance, than for a field of blood and battle. You may be shot, and scalped, or hung, sir, in the course of the morning.” “True, sir, and for that reason, I have dressed myself in this fashion. The idea of this extreme danger, alone, sir, prompted me to this display. For this reason I made my toilet with extreme care. I consumed, in my ablutions, an entire section of my famous Chinese soap. You perceive, sir, in the language of the divine Shakspeare”—stroking his chin complacently as he spoke,— “`I have reaped the stubble field'—also my chin was never smoother; and, in the conviction, sir, that I might VOL. II. 21 be called upon this day, to make my last public appearance, I have been at special pains to prepare my body, to the best advantage, for the inspection of the fortunate persons who will make the final disposition of it. To die with dignity, and to appear after death with grace, has been the reflection which has occupied my mind this morning, as I made my toilet. If these rogues are to inherit my wardrobe, let me make as much use of it as I can. I may probably secure this suit to myself by dying in it like a man.” The outlaw scarcely heard these forcible reasons— certainly he did not listen to them. He was already busy in disposing, to the best advantage, of his half score of muskets. The house was one of comparatively great strength. It was of brick, built for service, and had been more than once defended against the assaults of the Congarees. With an adequate force it might have been held against any assailants, unless they brought artillery. But the little squad of Edward Morton was wretchedly inadequate to its defence, even against the small force of Stockton. It required all of his skill, courage and ingenuity to make it tolerably secure. He now more than ever felt the absence of Watson Gray. The readiness of resource which that wily ruffian possessed, would, no doubt, have been productive of very important assistance. Even if the garrison could hold out against assault, they could not hope to do so against famine. The provisions of the plantation were already at the mercy of the Black Riders. The outlaw surveyed his prospects with sufficient misgivings. They were deplorable and discouraging enough. But he never once thought of faltering. His soul felt nothing but defiance. His words breathed nothing but confidence and strength. He laughed—he even laughed with scorn—when Hillhouse said something of a capitulation and terms. “Terms, sir! ay, we'll give and take terms—such terms as lie at the point of these bayonets, and can be understood from the muzzle of gun and pistol. Terms, indeed! Why do you talk of terms, sir, when we can beat and slay the whole gang of them in twenty minutes! Let them approach and give us a mark at all, and what chance can they have, with their pistols only, against these muskets? Really, Mr. Hillhouse, for a gentleman of high rank in his majesty's army, I am surprised that you should hold such language. If you dread the result, sir,—you are at liberty to leave the house this very moment. Go, sir, to a place of safety, if you can find it; or make your own terms with our enemies, as you or they please. Try it, and you'll find that your fine clothes will be one of the best arguments for hanging you to the first tree;—the Black Riders have long since learned that the finest bird is to be first plucked. We shall remain where we are, and probably inherit your wardrobe after all.” The surgeon was abashed and confounded for the moment. He had not often been compelled to listen to such language; nor did the outlaw intend it so much for the ears of the person whom he addressed as for those who listened around him. He knew the value of big words and bluster, in a time of doubt and danger, to the uninformed and vulgar mind. He felt that nothing could be hoped for, at the hands of his small party, if any of them were suffered to flinch or falter. He knew the importance of all that he himself said; but the surgeon did not once suspect it. He recovered from his astonishment, and, after a brief delay, his wounded pride found utterance. “Really, sir,—Mr. Conway, your language is exceedingly objectionable. I shall be constrained to notice it, sir; and to look for redress at your hands at the earliest opportunity.” “Any time, sir—now,—when you please—only don't afflict me with your apprehensions. If you cannot see, what is clear enough to the blindest mule that ever ploughed up a plain field, that these scoundrels stand no sort of chance against us, in open assault,—no words of mine, or of any man, can make you wiser. Like Rugely, you would surrender, I suppose, at the enforcement of a pine log.” A hearty laugh of the soldiers attested the inspiriting which they had imbibed from the confident bearing and words of Morton, and their familiarity with an anecdote which, but a little time before, had provoked much mirth in both parties at the expense of a provincial officer, in the British army.[4] [4] Colonel Rugely had command of a British stockade near Camden, which was garrisoned by an hundred men. It was summoned by Colonel William Washington. “Washington was without artillery; but a pine log, which was ingeniously hewn and arranged so as to resemble a field-piece, enforced, to the commander of the post, the propriety of surrendering, at the first summons of the American colonel. This harmless piece of timber, elevated a few feet from the earth, was invested by the apprehension of the garrison with such formidable power, that they were exceedingly glad to find a prompt acceptance of their submission.”—History of South Carolina, p. 187. It may be supposed that this burst of merriment did not diminish the anger of Hillhouse; but he contented himself with saying that he should “bide his time.” “You are right, sir, in this respect;” said Morton— “we have neither of us any time for private squabbles. Do your duty manfully to-day, Mr. Hillhouse, and if we survive it, I shall be ready to apologize to you to-morrow, or give you whatever satisfaction will please you best. But now to work. These shutters must be closed in and secured.” The lower story was completely closed up by this proceeding. The shutters, of solid oak, were fastened within, and, ascending to the upper story, Morton disposed his men in the different apartments, with strict warning to preserve the closest watch from the windows, at every point of approach. Having completed his disposition of the defences, he requested an interview with the ladies of the house, which was readily granted. The outlaw and surgeon were accordingly ushered into an antechamber in which, amidst the stir and bustle of the events going on below, they had taken refuge. The gentlemen were received with kindness At such moments—moments of sudden peril and unexpected alarm—the human ties assert their superiority, over the forms of society and the peculiar habits of education, through the medium of our fears; and even the suspicions which the ladies might have had, touching the character of Edward Morton—whom they knew only as Edward Conway—and the contempt which they felt for the fopperies of Hillhouse, gave way entirely before the pressing and mutual necessities which prevailed to the probable danger of the whole. But, in truth, the appearance of the outlaw, at that moment of his own superior peril, was well calculated to command the admiration even of those who loved him not. Man never looks so noble as when he contends calmly with the obvious danger—when, aware of all its worst characteristics, he yet goes forth to the encounter with a stern deliberate purpose, which sustains him unshrinking to the last, and suffers him, at no moment, to seem palsied, weak or indecisive. Edward Morton wore the aspect of this firmness, in the presence of the ladies. They knew that he was the destined victim whom the Black Riders professed to seek, and seek only;—they knew not exactly why—but their conjecture, naturally enough, in the absence of more certain reasons,—assumed it to be in consequence of his Americanism. Whatever might be the cause, to be the foe of the Black Riders was, in all likelihood, to be the friend of virtue and the right; and as he stood before them, erect for the first time after weeks of painful sickness and prostration,—more erect than ever—with a demeanour that did not presume in consequence of his situation,—nor challenge, by doubtful looks and tremulous tones, that sympathy which might well be asked for, but never by, “the brave man struggling with the storms of fate;”—he insensibly rose in the estimation of both, as his person seemed to rise nobly and commandingly in their sight. His voice was gentle and mournful—in this, perhaps, he did not forbear the exercise of some of his habitual hypocrisy. He did not forget for a moment that the keen glances of Flora Middleton were upon him; and like most men of the world, he never forgot that policy which casts about it those 21* seeds which, as they ripen into fruit,—whatever the degree of probability,—the same hand may gather which has sown. “Ladies, I am sorry to tell you that my presence has brought danger to your house.” The venerable lady replied promptly,— “I trust, Mr. Conway, that with the assistance of your followers you will be able to keep the danger from it.” “Alas, madam! I must not disguise from you the truth—we are as one to ten only;—we may slay many of the assailants, but if they are led by ordinary courage, they may eat through these walls in our despite. I have one hope that Watson Gray, who left the house last night, will return in season, with a sufficient force to baffle them in their attempts. All that can be done now will be to keep off the moment of danger—to parry for awhile, and protract as long as we can, the storm which will come at last.” “Mr. Conway,—I would not disparage your judgment or your valour,—but, the late General Middleton, when scarcely at your years, beat off three hundred Congarees from the very threshold of this dwelling.” The outlaw replied modestly with a bow of the head,— “We will do what we can do, Mrs. Middleton, but we have a poor squad of ten men in all, not including Mr. Hillhouse and myself. I have no doubt Mr. Hillhouse will do his duty as becomes him—” “As becomes a gentleman fighting in the presence of the fairest lady—” Morton continued his speech in season to interrupt some stiltish common-place of the surgeon, which could only have been digusting to the ladies. “As for myself, you know my condition. I can die —I need not, I trust, say, that no man could feel it hard to do so, under such circumstances as prevail over us at present—but I have little strength to make my death expensive to our enemies. There is one thing, Mrs. Middleton, that I have deferred speaking to the last.” He hesitated, and his eyes were fixed sadly for a moment upon the face of Flora, then, as he met her glance, they were instantly averted. “What is that, sir?” demanded the old lady. “It is this, madam:—there is one proceeding by which it is yet possible to avert from your dwelling the strife which will shortly threaten it.” “In God's name, sir, let it be resorted to—” “If it be right,—if it be proper, only, mother;” cried Flora earnestly, putting her hand upon the wrist of her grandmother. “Certainly—surely, my child;” was the reply. “Peace and safety are to be purchased only by just conduct. Speak, Mr. Conway, what is the alternative?” “Professedly, madam, these ruffians seek me, alone, of all this household. I am the sole object of their hate —the victim whom they have singled out for their special vengeance. Were I in their hands—” “Surely, Mr. Conway, you would not think so meanly of my mother and myself,” was the hasty interruption of Flora Middleton, “as to fancy that we could be pleased at your giving up any security, however partial, such as our house affords you, because of the possible annoyance to which we might be subjected on account of this banditti. I trust that you will be able to defend the house, and I hope that you will do so to the last.” The outlaw seemed to catch fire at the manner of the generous girl. Her own flashing eyes were full of a flame to impart enthusiasm to the dullest spirit; and he exclaimed with a more genuine feeling of zeal than was usual with him— “And, by heavens! I will! You have stifled the only doubts which I had of the propriety of making your house my castle. I need not say to you that the hostility of these scoundrels to me, is, perhaps, little more than a pretence. Even were I given up to them, and in their hands, they would probably sack your dwelling. They are, just now, I suspect, released from nearly all restraint and subjection, and about to fly the country. Lord Rawdon has gone, or is on his way below, by another route, with all his forces; and the men of Sumter, Lee, and Marion, are pressing at the heels of his lordship. Perhaps, I speak with literal accuracy when I say that your safety depends on mine. If I fail to make good the house against these Black Riders—you already know their character—I tremble for you! Your safety shall be no less in my thoughts during this conflict, than my own; and I repeat, once more, my readiness to die before outrage and violence shall cross your threshold.” “We thank you, sir,—from the bottom of our hearts, we thank you, Mr. Conway—” Morton bowed, as he interrupted the strain of feminine acknowledgment: “Let me now beg you to seek the garret—there you will be in tolerable safety. If we do not again meet, do me the justice to believe that I spared neither limb nor life, in your behalf. I may fall, but I will not falter.” “God be with you, Mr. Conway!” was the ejaculation of both ladies. A blush tinged the cheek of the outlaw, a tremulous emotion passed through his veins. When before had the pure of the purer sex, uttered such an invocation in his behalf? “Can it be an omen of ill,”— such was his reflection—“that it is spoken, as it would seem, in the last moment of my career?” “I thank you, Mrs. Middleton—I thank you,”—to Flora, but he did not speak her name. The direction of his eye indicated the person to whom he spoke. His look and air were not unadroit. He still remembered his policy; and Flora Middleton fancied, as she turned away, that she had not often seen a nobler-looking personage. The contrast between himself and Mr. Hillhouse, perhaps, helped to strengthen this impression. A grave monkey is of all objects the most lugubrious, and the plain statements of the outlaw had suddenly made the surgeon very grave. He really did not imagine that things were in so deplorable a condition. Thinking over them rendered him forgetful of his fine sayings, and the attempt which he made to throw some pathos into his parting address to the ladies, was ridiculous, without being easy, and elaborate and strained without being flowing or graceful. When they had gone, Mr. Hillhouse found a more ready tongue, and once more began to intimate the propriety of terms and a flag of truce. “In India once, an affair of the Sepoys,—very much like the present—a sort of meeting and insurrection—” “No more of this nonsense,” said Morton, with the old habit of command which belonged to the captain of the fierce banditti by which he was now threatened. “It's time, Mr. Hillhouse, to be a man, if you ever hope to be like one. Do you hear that trumpet, sir? It is a summons! It opens the business! You talk of terms and overtures! How do you like the idea of making them from the balcony of yonder porch? What?—it does not please you? Yet it must be done. Musketeers, to the windows! Cover the approach to the porch, and shoot as I bid—see that no man comes within pistol-shot. I, myself, will parley with those scoundrels.” The door of the great passage way which divided the dwelling centrally, was thrown open, and the outlaw presented himself in the balcony to the eyes of the Black Riders, who had assembled, some thirty or forty in number, in detached groups, about fifty yards from the building. A yell of ferocious exultation hailed his appearance from below, and attested the excited feelings of malicious hate with which they had been wrought upon to regard their ancient leader.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. THE SIEGE AND STORM. A smile of mixed bitterness and derision passed over the lips of the outlaw as he hearkened to the rude but mighty uproar. “Dogs!” he muttered, “there was a time when I would have made you crouch beneath the lash to your proper attitude!—and I may do so yet. I am not wholly powerless even now!” As they shouted, an involuntary movement was made by several among them. They rushed towards him, as if their purpose had been to approach him with determined violence. Several of these were dismounted, and these, waving their pistols aloft, were evidently disposed to bring themselves within the necessary distance which should permit of the certain use of their weapon. But Morton, in the intervals of their clamour, suffered them to hear his brief, stern command to the musketeers, whom they might behold at the windows, in readiness and watchful. “Shoot down the first scoundrel that advances with arms. Take good aim and spare none, unless I bid ye!” This order produced a pause in their career. Some incertitude seemed to prevail among them, and, at length, Morton distinguished, beneath a tree in the distance, the persons of Stockton, Darcy, and two others, who were evidently busy in the work of consultation. He, himself, quietly took his seat upon one of the benches in the balcony, and patiently waited the result of this deliberation. His pistols, broad-mouthed and long, of the heaviest calibre, were ready in his hand and belt, and all well loaded with a brace of balls. Meanwhile, his resolute appearance, placid manner, and the indifference which his position displayed, were all provocative of increased clamours and commotion among the crowd. They were evidently lashing themselves into fury, as does the bull when he desires the conflict for which he is not yet sufficiently blinded and maddened. Cries of various kinds, but all intended to stimulate their hostility to him, were studiously repeated by the emissaries of his successor. Not the less influential were those which dilated upon the spoils to be gathered from the contemplated sack of the barony— an argument which had most probably been more potent than any other in seducing them away from their fealty to the insubordinate desires of Stockton. Morton watched all these exhibitions without apprehension, though not without anxiety; and when he turned, and gave a glance to his few followers within the house —drilled men, stubborn and inflexible, who could easier die, under the command to do so, than obey the impulse to flight, without hearing the “retreat” sounded—but who had no other resources of mind and character beyond the dogged resolution taught by their military life —his heart misgave him. He felt what he himself might do in command of the Black Riders against such defenders as he then possessed; and he did not deceive himself as to the probable result. One hope yet remained. It was that Watson Gray was somewhere busy in his behalf. His eyes often stretched beyond the park, in the direction of the high road, in the vain hope to see his confederate, with some hastily gathered recruits, marching to his rescue. At that very moment Gray was quivering in the few brief agonies of death, which he endured under the sabre of Clarence Conway. The deliberations of Stockton and his confederates were soon at an end, and, with them, the doubts of the outlaw. Stockton himself made his appearance in the foreground, bearing a white handkerchief fastened to a sapling. His offensive weapons he ostentatiously spread out upon the earth—at some distance from the mansion —when he came fairly into sight. His course, which was intended to inspire confidence in himself, among his followers, had been dictated by Darcy. “They must see that you're as bold as Ned Morton. He comes out full in front and you must do no less. You must go to meet him. It will look well among the men.” There were some misgivings in Stockton's mind as to the probable risk which he incurred; nor was Darcy himself entirely without them. Morton, they knew to be desperate; and if he could conjecture their intentions toward him, they could very well understand how gladly he would avail himself of the appearance of Stockton to extinguish the feud in his blood. The idea, in fact, crossed the mind of Morton himself. “That scoundrel!”—he muttered as Stockton approached him—“is the cause of all. Were he out of the way—and a single shot does it!—but, no! no!—he has put down his arms; and then there's that base scoundrel Darcy in the background. Were I to shoot Stockton, he would bring out another of these bloodhounds to fill his place. I should gain nothing by it. Patience! Patience! I must bide my time, and wait for the turn of the die.” Meanwhile, Stockton advanced, waving aloft his symbol of peace. Morton rose at his approach, and went forward to the railing of the balcony. “Well,”—he demanded—“for what purpose does Lieutenant Stockton come?” “Captain Stockton, if you please. He comes to know if you are ready to deliver yourself up for trial by the troop, as was agreed upon by Watson Gray yesterday.” “Let Watson Gray answer for himself, Captain or Lieutenant Stockton. He will probably be upon your backs with Coffin's cavalry in twenty minutes. For me, sirrah—hear the only answer I make. I bid you defiance; and warn you now to get back to your covert with all expedition. You shall have five minutes to return to your confederates; if you linger after that time—ay, or any of your crew—you shall die like dogs. Away!” The retort of Stockton was that of unmeasured abuse. A volume of oaths and execrations burst from his lips; but Morton, resuming his seat, cried to the musketeers— “Attention—make ready—take aim!” Enough was effected, without making necessary the final command, to “fire.” Stockton took to his heels, in most undignified retreat; and, stumbling before he quite regained the shelter of the wood, fell, head foremost, and was stretched at full length along the earth, to the merriment of some and the vexation of others among his comrades. The fury of the conspirator was increased by this event; and he proceeded, with due diligence, to commence the leaguer. His corps were suddenly commanded to disappear from the open ground; and when Edward Morton saw them again, they were in detached parties, preserving cover as well as they could, along the edges of the park, the avenue, a small thicket of sassafras and cedar that lay along the northern skirts of the mansion-house, and such of the outhouses and domestic offices, as could bring them near enough to act upon the defenders without exposure of themselves. The body thus distributed was formidably numerous when compared with that of Morton. His estimate made them little less than sixty men. Immediately in front, though beyond the sure reach of musketry, Stockton, himself, prepared to take his stand, surrounded by some half dozen of his troop; and among these, to the increased annoyance of Morton, he saw one who unslung a rifle from his shoulder. At this sight he at once withdrew from the balcony, secured the door, and commanded his musketeers to sink from sight, and avoid unnecessary exposure. The warning was just in season. In the very instant while he spoke the glass was shattered above his own head, and the sharp, clear sound which accompanied the event attested the peculiar utterance of the rifle. “A little too much powder, or a young hand,” said Morton coolly. “Give me your musket, one of you?” He took his place at the window, detached the bayonet from the muzzle of the gun, and handed it back to the soldier. “But for the steel”—meaning the bayonet—“the smooth bore would be a child's plaything against that rifle. But I have made a musket tell at a hundred yards, and may again. We must muzzle that rifle if we can.” The gun was scarcely lifted to the eyes of the speaker before its dull, heavy roar was heard, awakening all the echoes of the surrounding woods. The men rushed to the window, and as the smoke lifted, they perceived that the party of Stockton was dispersed, while one man stood, leaning, as if in an attitude of suffering, against a tree. The rifle, however, appeared in another hand at some little distance off. Morton shook his head with dissatisfaction, as he recollected that while there were fifty men in the ranks of the enemy, to whom the VOL. II. 22 rifle was a familiar weapon, to disarm one, or a dozen, was to do little or nothing for his own and for the safety of his party. In a few moments after sudden cries and a discharge of firearms from the opposite quarter of the building betrayed the beginning of the strife where Mr. Hillhouse commanded. “Keep as well covered as you can, men; but watch well that they do not close in with you. You are but twelve feet above them, and at that distance a pistol is quite as dangerous as a musket. I leave you for an instant, only, to look at the rear.” There, he found Hillhouse, doing his duty as bravely as if he had no fine uniform at hazard. “You take a needless risk,” said Morton, as he beheld him flashing one of his pretty, but trifling weapons, at the invaders, and exposing, the while, his entire person to their aim. “There will be time enough for that when they are pressing through the breach.” “They are at it now,” said the other, with a momentary forgetfulness of all his circuitous phraseologies. “They've got ladders, and are trying to mount.” “Indeed!” cried the outlaw, drawing his sabre from the sheath, and pushing Hillhouse aside, with a seeming forgetfulness of his own wounds and infirmities. He approached the window, and saw the truth of the surgeon's representations. A squad of the Black Riders had, indeed, pressed forward to the wall sufficiently nigh to plant against it, the rack, which they had taken from the stables; and which furnished them a solid and sufficient ladder to carry up two men abreast. Hillhouse, in his haste, had suffered the four musketeers who had been allowed him, for the defence of the rear, to fire simultaneously, and, in the interval required by them to reload their pieces, the ladder had been planted, and half a dozen sable forms were already darting upward, upon its rungs. “Reload, instantly!” Morton cried to the musketeers. “Keep your small pistols for close conflict, Mr. Hillhouse—they are fit for nothing better.” The now cool, observing outlaw, receded a moment from the window, while a blaze of pistol-shot from without, shivered the glass. He awaited this discharge, only, to advance, and with better aim, to level a brace of pistols at the same moment, among his foes, just when the ladder was most darkened, and trembling, with their forms. Of the foremost assailants, when the broad muzzles met their glance, one dashed resolutely forward up the ladder, but received the bullet through his brain and tumbled headlong backwards; while the other, with less audacity, endeavouring to retreat, was forced onward by those behind him. He had the alternative only, of throwing himself over, which he did at the risk of a broken neck; and the bullets of the remaining pistol, which Morton had drawn from his belt, were expended upon the rest of the scaling party, by whom they were utterly unexpected. This discharge had the effect of clearing the ladder for an instant; and Morton, commanding two of the musketeers, who had now reloaded, to keep the enemy at a distance, by a close watch from an adjoining window, endeavoured, with the aid of the remaining two, to draw the ladder up, and into the window, against which it rested. But the weight of the massive frame was infinitely beyond their strength; and the outlaw contented himself with cutting away the rungs, which formed its steps, with his sabre, as far as his arm could reach. He had not finished this labour ere he was summoned to the front. There, the enemy had also succeeded in drawing the fire of the musketeers; and then, closing in, had effected a permanent lodgment beneath the porch below. This was a disaster. Under the porch they were most effectually sheltered from any assault from above, and could remain entirely out of sight, unless they themselves determined otherwise. How many of them had succeeded in obtaining this cover, could not be said by the soldiers. Their conjecture, however, represented it at ten at least—a force fully equal to that which was engaged in the defence. The brow of Morton grew darker as he discovered this circumstance. The net of the fates was evidently closing around him fast; and, for a moment, he gazed anxiously over the distant stretch of the road, in the fond hope to see Watson Gray riding in to his succour. But he turned away in hopelessness at last. His despondency did not, however, lead to any relaxation of his courage, or of that desperate determination, which he entertained, to make the fight as terrible to his foes as their hostility threatened to be terrible to him. A momentary cessation of the strife appeared to have taken place. The outlaws, who were beneath the balcony, remained perfectly quiescent. “They can do nothing there, unless we let them. Now, men, do you keep your arms ready. Throw away no shot at the cracking of a pistol. What should it matter to you if the fools snap their puppies at you all day at a distance of fifty yards. Let no more of them join these below the porch, if you can help it—let none of these get away if bullets can stop their flight; but do not all of you fire at once. Keep one half of your muskets always in reserve for the worst.” While giving these instructions, Morton was prepared in getting his own weapons in readiness. The strife once begun, with the loss of men to the assailants, could not, he well knew, come to an indefinite or sudden conclusion. There was to be more of it, and his chief apprehensions now arose from the party which had found lodgment under the portico below. To the lower story he despatched one of his soldiers, whom he instructed to remain quiet, in the under passages of the house, in order to make an early report of any movements which might take place in that quarter. He had scarcely adopted this precaution before the clamours of battle were again renewed in the part where Hillhouse was stationed. Twenty shots were fired on both sides, without intermission, in as many seconds, and, in the midst of all, a deep groan and the fall of a heavy body in the adjoining room, struck cold to the heart of Morton. He could ill afford to lose any one of his small array. He hurried to the scene of operations, and found that one of the soldiers had fallen. He still lived, but the wound was in his bosom; and a hurried inspection showed it to be from the fatal rifle. The ragged orifice, wrought by the peculiar revolutions of the deadly twist, was large enough to have received a small fowl egg. The dying man looked up to the outlaw, as if to ask if there was any hope. So Morton understood the appealing inquiry in his eyes, and he answered it with soldierly frankness. “Make your peace with God, my good fellow; it's all over with you. You'll be dead in five minutes.” The man groaned once, shivered fearfully, then turned upon his face. His arms were once stretched out—his fingers endeavoured to grasp the floor, then relaxed, then stiffened, and he lay unconscious of the rest. He was dead. Morton stepped over his body and took a hurried glance at the window. “We have shot three of them,” said Hillhouse. “Would it were thirty! But all will not do. Are you loaded, men, and ready?” “Yes!” was the answer of all. “Then keep ready, but keep out of sight. Wait till they mount the ladder, expend no more shot, but rely on the push of the bayonet. There are four of you, and they have but the one ladder. The rifle cannot be used while they are on it, and at no other time need you show yourselves.” Such were the hurried directions of the outlaw, which were interrupted by the renewal of the conflict. Once more they were upon the ladder, but this time the clamours arose also in front. “Oh, for twenty muskets, but twenty”—cried the now thoroughly aroused Morton, as he made his way once more to the little squad which he had left in front—“and dearly should they pay for this audacity! Nay, if I only had my own strength!”—he murmured, as he leaned, half fainting, against the door lintel in the passage. A new assault from another quarter, aroused him to the consciousness of his increasing dangers, and stimulated him anew with the strength to meet it. The thunders of an axe were heard against the lower door of the entrance, and from the portico where the party had previously found a lodgment. “This was what I feared! The trial, the danger, is 22* here at last! But the game is one at which both of us may do mischief. I must be there to meet them. Heaven send that Stockton may be the first to find entrance!” The soldier now appeared from below giving him the information, which he no longer needed, of the dangers that threatened from that quarter. The cheering reply of Morton sent him down again. “Ay, ay, back to your post! You shall have help enough before they get in—before you need it.” From the upper part of the house he drew all the soldiers with the exception of three. One of these kept his place in the front, the other two in the rear, where the attempt had been made to force an entrance by means of the ladder. These stations were left under the direction of the surgeon. The greater danger was now below. He regarded the efforts of those above to be feints simply. “Mr. Hillhouse, you have only to be wary. Your two bayonets, with your own pistols, will keep down all your enemies. But, should you apprehend otherwise, draw the musket from the front of the house to your assistance. There is perhaps less likelihood of assault from that quarter. Below, the struggle must be made hand to hand. The passage is narrow, and six stout men may be able to keep it against twenty. Farewell, sir—be firm—I may never see you again.” The surgeon had some tender philosophy, gleaned from his usual vocabulary of common-places, to spend, even at such a moment, and Morton left him speaking it. He hurried down stairs with the six soldiers, whom he stationed in the passage-way, but a little in the background, in order that they should not only escape any hurt from the flying fragments of the open door as it should be hewn asunder, but that a sufficient number of the banditti might be allowed to penetrate and crowd the opening. Meanwhile the strokes of the axe continued with little interval. The door was one of those ancient, solid structures of oak, doubled and plated with ribs which, in our day, might almost be employed for beams and rafters. It had been constructed with some reference to a siege from foes who used no artillery; and its strength, though it did not baffle, yet breathed not a few of the assailants, before it yielded to the final application of the axe. As the splinters flew around them, Morton wiped the heavy and clammy dews from his forehead. Cold chills were upon him, and yet he felt that there was a burning fever in his brain. The excitement was too great;—the transition from the bed of wounds and sickness, he felt, must work the most fatal effects even if he survived the struggle. But the solemn conviction had at length reached his soul that he was not to survive. The awful truth had touched his innate mind, that in a few hours he must be a portion of the vast, the infinite, the strange eternity. “Surely! I shall not find it hard!” was the audible speech which this conviction forced from him. He started at the sound of his own voice. Thought was painful and torturing. The pause which had been allowed him, left him only to agony; and he longed for the coming on of the strife, and the reckless conflict, to relieve him, by their terrible excitements, from thoughts and feelings still more terrible. This relief, dreadful as it threatened to be, was now at hand. The massive bolts which secured the frame-work of the door were yielding. Some of the panels were driven in—and the soldiers were preparing to lunge away, through the openings, at the hearts of the assailants. But this Morton positively forbid. In a whisper, he commanded them to keep silent and in the background. Their muskets were levelled, under his direction, rather under breast height, and presented at the entrance;—and, in this position, he awaited, with a stillness like that which precedes the storm, for that moment when he might command all his bolts to be discharged with the unerring certainty of fate. Moments now bore with them the awful weight of hours; the impatient murmurs deepened from without; the strokes of the axe became redoubled; and the groaning timbers, yielding at every stroke, were already a wreck. Another blow, and the work was done! Yet, ere the dreadful certainty yawned upon them—ere the chasm was quite complete—a wild chorus of yells above stairs—the rush of hurrying footsteps—the shrieks and the shot—announced to the gloomy outlaw, below, the occurrence of some new disaster. His defences were driven in above! A troop of the outlaws had, in fact, already effected their entrance. They had literally clambered up the slender columns of the portico in front,—the sentinel placed in that quarter having been just before withdrawn to the rear by Hillhouse, who deemed that he would be more useful there, and under his command, which he wished, with natural vanity, to make as respectable as possible. Lifting one of the sashes, without being heard in the din which prevailed below, they had found their way silently into the apartment. Stealing cautiously along the passage, they had come upon the surgeon, while himself and little squad were most busy with the assailants from without. The skirmish between them had been short. The first notice that Hillhouse had of his danger, was from the pistol-shot by which he was stricken down. His men turned to meet their new enemies, and in the brief interval that ensued, other foes dashed up the ladder, through the window, into the apartment, and put the finishing stroke to the conflict there. Hillhouse was not so much hurt as not to be conscious, before sinking into insensibility, that the outlaws were already stripping him of his gorgeous apparel. His scarlet coat had already passed into the hands of a new owner. Meanwhile the work was going on below. Morton, when he heard the uproar above, readily divined the extent of his misfortune. But he was not suffered to muse upon it long. His own trial was at hand. The door was finally driven from all its fastenings, there was no longer any obstruction, and the living tide poured in, as Morton fancied they would, in tumultuous masses. Then came the awful order from his lips to “fire!” It was obeyed by the first file of three men, kneeling; the remaining three followed the example a moment after; and yells of anguish ensued, and mingled with the first wild shouts of triumph of the assailants! It was a moment of mixed pain and terror! Perhaps, if they could have recoiled, they would have done so. But this was now a physical impossibility. The crowd in the rear pressed forward and wedged their comrades who were in the foreground; while the bayonet plied busily among them. But what could be done, in that way, by six men in a hand to hand conflict with six times their number. The strife was dreadful, but short. Man after man of the outlaws, was spiked upon the dripping steel; but the mass, unable to retreat, were driven forward, mad and foaming, under the feeling of desperation which now filled their hearts, they ceased to think or fear, and they rushed like the wild bull upon the ready bayonets. The soldiers went down under the sheer pressure of their crowding bodies. The Black Riders darted among and over them, searching each heart separately with their knives; and the only strife which now remained was from the unavoidable conflict among themselves of their jostling and conflicting forms. The hoarse accents of Stockton were now heard, pre-eminent above the uproar, giving his final orders. “Take Ned Morton alive, my merry fellows. He owes a life to the tree and timber. Save him for it if you can.” Morton had reserved himself for this moment. “Ye have tracked the tiger to his den!” he muttered, in the shadow of the stairway, where he had taken his position, partly concealed in the obscurity of the passage. The crisis of his fate was at hand. The party from above were now heard hurrying downwards, to mingle in the melée below; and he levelled his pistols among the crowd in the direction of Stockton's voice, and fired —not without effect. He was now too deliberate to throw away his bullets. One of them passed through the fleshy part of the shoulder of his inveterate enemy, who was in the advance; while the other prostrated in death one of his most forward followers. Stockton screamed with mingled pain and fury, and with sabre lifted, darted upon his foe. Feebly shouting his hate and defiance, Morton also lifted his sword, which he had leaned on the steps beside himself, for greater convenience; and advanced gallantly to meet the ruffian. They met, and the whole remaining strength of Morton, treasured up for this very crisis, was thrown into his arm. But the tasks through which he had already gone had exhausted him. The limb fell nerveless by his side, and ere the blow of Stockton descended, he had sunk down in utter insensibility, at the feet of his opponent. The conflict was ended. The pledge made to the ladies of the mansion had been amply redeemed by its defenders. Not one of them remained unhurt; and the greater number were already stiffened in the unrelaxing grasp of death. The outlaws had paid dearly for their victory. No less than sixteen of their number had been slain; and the arts of Stockton, which had originally won them over to his designs, and made them hostile to their ancient leader, now derived additional support from the sanguinary feeling which had been induced by the bloody struggle in their minds. They were now reconciled to that decree which determined that Morton should be their victim. They needed no more persuasion to resolve that he should die upon the gallows. The first impulse of Stockton, as he straddled the inanimate body of the man whom he so much feared and hated, was to spurn it with his foot,—the next to make his fate certain by a free use of his sword upon it; but the cold malignity of his character prevailed to prolong the life and the trial of his enemy. The utter impotence of Morton to do further harm, suggested to Stockton the forbearance which he would not otherwise have displayed. It was with some pains only, and a show of resolution, such as Morton had usually employed to hold them in subjection, that he was enabled to keep back his followers, who, in their blind rage, were pressing forward with the same murderous purpose which he had temporarily arrested in his own bosom. With a more decided malignity of word, he gave a new direction to their bloody impulses. “Away,” he cried, “get a hurdle, or something that will take him out without much shaking! He has life enough in him yet for the gallows!” A shout seconded with approbation the dark suggestion, and the crowd rushed away to procure the necessary conveyance. A door, torn from an outhouse, answered this purpose; and the still breathing, but motionless form of Edward Morton, was lifted upon it. Unhappily, he wakened to consciousness in a few moments after leaving the threshold of the dwelling. The purer atmosphere without revived him; and his eyes opened to encounter the biting scorn, and the insulting triumph, everywhere apparent. His ears were filled with the gross mockeries of those whom his bloody resistance had stimulated to new hate and a deeper ferocity of temper. A bitter pang went keenly through his heart; but he had still a hope. He had kept one hope in reserve for some such occasion. Long before, when he first commenced that dark career of crime, the cruel fruits of which he was about to reap, he had provided himself with a dagger—a small, stout, but short instrument—which he hid within his bosom. This instrument he devoted to the one particular purpose of taking his own life. He had decreed that it should be sacred— not to employ language illegitimately—to the one work of suicide only! But once, indeed, he had almost violated his resolve. The same instrument he had proffered to poor Mary Clarkson, in a mood, and at a moment of mockery, scarcely less bitter than had fallen to his own lot. The remembrance of the circumstance touched him at this instant; and humbled, in some degree, the exulting feeling which was rising in his breast, at the recollection of his resource. But he did exult, nevertheless. He felt that the dagger was still about him, hidden within the folds of his vest; and, with this knowledge, he was better able to meet the vindictive glance of his foe, who walked beside the litter on which the outlaws were bearing him to the wood. “Bring him to the Park!” commanded Stockton. “He will hang there more conspicuously, as a warning for other traitors.” “No! No!—not there,” said Darcy, interposing, “the ladies can see him from the house.” “Well, and a very good sight it is too;” replied the other, brutally, “they've seen him often enough dancing on the earth, I fancy; it may be an agreeable change to behold him dancing in air awhile.” A few serious words, however, whispered in his ears by Darcy, prevailed with Stockton to effect a change in his brutal resolution; and the cavalcade took its way in the direction of the woods where the encampment of the Black Riders for the night had been made. It was intended that there the crowning scene of hate and punishment should take place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. HATE BAFFLED BY JUSTICE. Meanwhile, what had been the condition of mind of the ladies in the dwelling? They had heard the greater part of the bloody struggle going on below—the shots —the shouts, the groans and shrieks, and all the infernal clamours of that strife of moral feelings and physical passions, in which man, alone, of all the animals, is permitted to indulge. The rending of bolt and bar had also been audible, and they readily conjectured all the rest. They finally knew that the barriers were forced, and when the first rush of the strife was over, and the silence of death prevailed for the first time below, then did they feel assured that death himself was there, surrounded by all his melancholy trophies. How terrible was then that silence! For the first time during the whole period of their suspense, did Flora Middleton yield herself up to prayer. Before, she could not kneel. While the storm raged below, her soul seemed to be in it,—she could not divert it to that calmer, holier contemplation which invests the purpose with purity, and lifts the eye of the worshipping spirit to the serene courts of Heaven. Her father's spirit was then her own, and she felt all its stimulating strength. She felt that she too could strike, should there be occasion; and when at one moment the clamour seemed to be approaching, her eye kindled with keener fire, as it looked round the dim attic in which they had sought refuge, as if in search of some weapon which might defend it. “It's all over!” at length she exclaimed, when the silence had continued the space of half an hour. “They have left the house, mother.” “Do not trust to go out yet, my child,” was the answer of the grandmother. “I fear some trick, some danger;—for why should they leave us undisturbed, so long.” “Hark! mother—there is a noise below.” “Yes,—I think so! I hear it!” “A footstep,—I should know that footstep!—a voice! It is,—it must be the voice of Clarence Conway.” The keen sense of the interested heart had not deceived the maiden. Clarence Conway was, indeed, within the dwelling. With limbs that trembled, and a heart that shuddered as he advanced, the young commander trod the avenues of the dwelling which bore such bloody proofs, at every footstep, of the fearful conflict which we have faintly endeavoured to describe. The victims were all unknown to him, and their uniforms, those equally of the British and the banditti, did not awaken in him any sympathy in their behalf. On the contrary, it would seem that enemies alone had fallen, and the inference was natural enough that they had fallen by the hands of those who were friends to the country. But how should the patriots have assailed the enemy in the dwelling which, hitherto, among all the Americans, had been considered sacred. Even though it had been made their place of retreat and refuge, such, he would have preferred it to remain, sooner than its peaceful and pure sanctuary should have been dishonoured by such unholy tokens. But the more serious concern which troubled him, arose from his apprehensions for Flora and her grandmother. He hurried through the several chambers, calling on their names. Well might his voice thicken with a husky horror, as he heard the responses only of the deserted VOL. II. 23 apartments, in so many mocking echoes. At length, when he was most miserable, and when, in his further search in the upper chambers, he dreaded lest he should happen on their mangled remains, his ear recognised, or he fancied, an answer in those tones which were then doubly dear to his senses. “Flora, dear Flora!” he cried aloud, but with a rapidity of utterance which almost made his syllables incoherent, lest he should somehow lose the repetition of the sweet assurance which he had so faintly heard before. The door of the attic was thrown open in the next instant, and the voice of the maiden summoned him to her presence. He clasped her in his arms with a fervour which could not be put aside; which no mere looks of reserve could discourage or repulse; nay, under circumstances of relief which wrought in her mind a momentary forgetfulness of his supposed perfidy. “Thank God, you are safe!” was his fervent ejaculation; “but tell me, dear Flora, what means the horrible carnage which has taken place below?” “Oh, Clarence—your brother! Is he not there—is he not among the slain?” “No! he is not among them—what of him? I see none among the slain but British and sworn enemies.” “Then they have made him prisoner—the Black Riders—they made the assault upon the house because he was in it; their avowed purpose being to execute death upon him as a rebel.” A sad smile passed over the lips of Clarence, as he heard these words, and his head was shaken with a mournful doubt. “He has nothing to fear from them, Flora!” he replied, “but where are they? How long is it since this dreadful affair took place.” “Scarce and hour. The horrible strife I seem to hear now. To my senses it is scarcely ended.” “Enough! I must believe you then. I must fall upon these bloodhounds if I can. Farewell, dear Flora, —farewell, for a little while.” “But your brother—remember, Colonel Conway, that he is your brother!” “Colonel Conway!” exclaimed the young soldier, with a surprise that was greatly increased as he beheld the looks of the speaker, now suddenly cold and frozen. “There is something wrong, Flora, I perceive; and it all comes from that same brother, whose relationship you are so anxious to have me remember. Would to God that he had remembered it. But I will save him if I can. You may be right—he may be in danger. Those bloody wretches would not make much difference between friend and foe, in their love of strife and plunder. But meet me not with such looks when I return.” “Fly, if you would save him. I tremble, Colonel Conway, lest you should be too late!” “Colonel Conway, again! Flora Middleton, you have again listened to the voice of the slanderer. There must be an explanation of this, dear Flora.” “There shall be, but fly now, if you would be of service,—if you would lessen the difficulties of that explanation.” “Be it so! I leave you, Flora, but will leave a few trusty men to rid your dwelling of these bloody tokens. Meanwhile, spare yourself the sight; keep your present place of retreat, till you hear my voice. Farewell.” “Farewell!”—the word was uttered by Flora with emphatic fervour. From her heart she wished him, of all others, to fare well! She looked with a longing, lingering gaze after his noble form, so erect, so commanding, so distinguished in all its movements, by the governing strength of a high and fearless soul within. “Can such a presence conceal such baseness!” she murmured, as she returned to the attic. “Can it be, dear mother?” was the apparently unmeaning expression which fell involuntarily from her lips, as she buried her face in bitter anguish, in the bosom of the maternal lady. Clarence Conway immediately set his troop in motion. He detached his more trusty scouts in advance. At the moment of leaving the house, he had no sort of intelligence which could designate the position of the Black Riders, or even assure him of their near neighborhood. Not an individual was to be seen around the dwelling. The slaves of the plantation, at the first approach of the conflict, took flight to the swamp-thickets; and in these they would remain until long after the strom had overblown. Conway moved forward therefore with the greatest caution. He might be entering an ambuscade, and certainly had reason to apprehend one, in consequence of the sudden flight of the banditti from the mansion-house before they had sacked it. The idea that Edward Conway had any thing really to fear from those whom he too well knew to be his confederates, was something of an absurdity, which he found little difficulty in dismissing from his mind. He rejoiced, at the first moment of receiving the intelligence, that his brother lived—that he had survived the fiercer conflict which had taken place between them. But, an instant after, and he almost regretted that such was the case. It was his duty to pursue him as a public enemy, and one of a cast so atrocious that he well knew, if taken, his life would probably be required by the hands of the summary avenger. The stern justice which in those days required blood for blood, had long since selected the fierce chief of the Black Riders as a conspicuous victim for the gallows; and Clarence Conway, as a means to avoid this cruel possibility, issued the sanguinary orders to his troop to show no quarter. The tenderest form of justice called for their extermination in the shortest possible manner. This resolve was made and the command given, after he had been advised by the scouts that the enemy were collected in force upon an open ground on the river bluff, a short mile and a half above. The scouts reported that a good deal of confusion appeared among them, but they could not approach sufficiently nigh to ascertain its particular occasion; having returned, in obedience to orders, as soon as they had traced out the enemy's place of retreat. They also conveyed to Conway the farther intelligence that they might have gone much nearer with impunity,—that the foe, so far from forming an ambush, had not, in fact, taken the usual precautions against attack,—had not thrown out any sentinels, and might be surprised with little difficulty. Upon hearing this, Clarence Conway gave orders for a division of his force into three equal parties; one of which was despatched to make a circuit, and gain a point above them upon the river, a second was ordered to traverse the river banks from below, while he, himself, leading on the third division, was to burst suddenly upon them from the forest—the nearest point from which the attack could be made. These orders had scarcely been given, before the sound of a rifle was heard, in the direction of the spot where the outlaws were assembled, and this was followed by a confused clamour, as of many voices. This hurried the movement. What was the meaning of that shot? Did it indicate alarm among the enemy? Were they apprised of his approach? Clarence Conway, in all his conjectures, made no sort of approach to the real nature of that one rifle-shot, and yet it was of some importance to him and to his feelings. It rendered a portion of his task less irksome, and far less difficult. Silently, he led the way for his division—not a bugle sounded—scarce a word was spoken, and the parties separated on their several courses, with no more noise than was unavoidable, from the regular and heavy tread of their horses' feet. It was fortunate for them, perhaps, that the banditti which they sought were only too busy in their own purposes to be heedful of their foes until it was too late. But let us not anticipate. The Black Riders had borne their victim, with slow steps, upon his litter, to the spot which had been chosen for his last involuntary act of expiation. Their advance was preceded by that of our old friend, the watchful scout, John Bannister. Anxious, to the last degree, for the safety of the ladies of the barony, he had tracked the steps of the outlaws to the assault upon the dwelling,—following as closely upon their heels as could be justified by a prudential regard to his own safety. He had beheld so much of the conflict as could be comprehended by one who was compelled to maintain his watch from a distant covert in the woods. The cause of the 23* fight, and the parties to it, were equally inscrutable to him; and this, too, added not a little to the anxiety which filled his mind. This anxiety grew to agony when he discovered that the defences of the dwelling were broken down, and the house in the possession of the banditti. The fate of Flora Middleton was in their hands, and he was impotent to serve or save her. His anguish was truly indescribable, as it was nearly insupportable. But he was suddenly aroused from its indulgence, when he beheld the crowd, as, leaving the house, it advanced through the grounds to that very spot in the woods in which he had made his hiding place. It became necessary to decamp; and as he sped back to the place where he had left his canoe in the custody of the landlord and Jacob Clarkson, he was somewhat surprised to find that they continued to follow in his footsteps. Somewhat wondering at this, and at their brief delay in the dwelling which they had entered after so obstinate a conflict, he ordered Muggs to put himself, Clarkson and the canoe, into close cover, while he, himself, advancing somewhat upon the higher grounds before them, could, from a place of concealment, observe the movements of the enemy, and prescribe the farther conduct of his own attendants. He had not long to wait. The Black Riders brought their prisoner to the very spot where the body of Mary Clarkson lay buried. The fainting form of the outlaw chief was leaned against the head-board which the devoted Bannister had raised to her memory; and, as the anguish following the transfer of his body to the ground from the door on which it had been borne, caused Morton to open his eyes, and restored him to consciousness, the letters “M. C.” met his first glance, but their import remained unconjectured. He had not much time allowed him for conjectures of any kind. His implacable foe, Stockton, stood before him with looks of hate and triumph which the prostrate man found it difficult to endure, but utterly impossible to avoid. “It is all over with you, Ned Morton,” said the other. “Will you beg for your life—will you supplicate me for mercy?” A smile of scorn passed over the lips of the outlaw. “My life is not in your hands;” he replied, “and, if it were, it should be thrice forfeit before I should acknowledge your power and ask your mercy. I bid you defiance to the last; I look upon you without fear, though with unsuppressed loathing, as I quit the world, and, in this way, do I baffle all your malice.” As he spoke these words, he drew the little stiletto suddenly from his bosom, and plunged it desperately, and with an effort of all his strength, full at his own heart. But the blow was baffled. The hand of Darcy, who had placed himself behind Morton without his knowledge, was extended at the moment, and grasped the arm which impelled the weapon. “Not so fast!” cried Stockton, as he wrested the weapon from his hand, and flung it from him, “there's no cheating the halter. It's a destiny!” The baffled outlaw writhed himself about, and looking round upon Darcy, with a bitter smile, exclaimed— “May your last friend fail you, as mine has done, at the last moment!” A faintness then came over him, his eyes closed, and he sank back exhausted upon the little hillock which covered Mary Clarkson. Little did he at that moment conjecture on whose bosom his body temporarily found repose. “Up with him at once;” cried Stockton, “or he will cheat the gallows at last.” An active brigand then ran up the trunk of a huge water oak that stood nighest to the spot. The rope was flung to him and fastened; and two of the banditti, stooping down raised the fainting outlaw upon their shoulders, while the noose was to be adjusted. As his form was elevated above the level of the rest, the crowd shouted with ferocious exultation; and brought back to the eyes of their destined victim, a portion of their former fire. He recovered a momentary strength. He looked round upon them with scorn. He felt his situation, and all the shame, and all the agony,—but his glances were full of life and defiance, and his cheeks were utterly unblenching. “He'll die game!” muttered John Bannister, who, at length, as he recognized the features of Edward Conway, began to conjecture the truth, and to comprehend the circumstances, which were lately so inscrutable. “He'll die game; he's got some of the good blood of the Conways in him, after all. But it's a mortal pity he should die so, for the family's sake. It's a good name, and he's the blood-kin of Clarence.” The scout lifted his rifle, as he thus soliloquized. The evident desire to interpose, and save the victim from one fate by the substitution of another, was strong and anxious in his mind. “But, no!”—he said, after he had drawn his sight upon the pale brow of the outlaw.—“If it's to be done at all, Jake Clarkson's the man to do it. He's got a sort of right to Ned Conway's life. Jake! Jake!” He called up the desolate old man, who, on the lower ground by the river had not seen these proceedings. “Jake!” he said—“is your rifle loaded?” “Yes!” “Then look, man!—there's your enemy—there's Ned Conway—it's him that they're a-lifting up among them there. I 'spose they want to do him some parti'lar kind of honour, but it's jest over poor Mary's grave!” The words were electric! The old man grasped and raised his weapon. He saw not the purpose of the crowd, nor did he pause to ask what was the sort of honour which they were disposed to confer upon the outlaw. He saw him!—his face only! That he knew, and that was enough. A moment elapsed— but one!—and the report of the rifle rang sharply along the river banks. In the same moment the men who were lifting Edward Morton to the tree, dropped the body to the ground. The work of death was already done! Their efforts were no longer necessary, as their design was unavailing. The bullet had penetrated the forehead of the outlaw, and his blood streamed from the orifice upon the still fresh mould which covered the victim of his passions. The Black Riders turned to the quarter whence the shot had come, but the boat of John Bannister, with his associates, were already at some distance from the shore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CONCLUSION. The rage of Stockton, at being thus defrauled of his prey, at last, though violent, was of no effect. He discharged his own pistol at the boat which contained the fugitives; an idle act, which was followed by a like discharge from some twenty of his followers. They might as well have aimed their bullets at the moon. John Bannister answered them with a shout,—which, to their consternation, found an echo from twenty voices in the woods behind them. They turned to confront an unexpected enemy. Clarence Conway was already upon them. His little band, in advance of the other two divisions, began the fray as soon as it had reached within striking distance; and the sudden effect of their surprise compensated well for the inadequacy of their numbers. The broadsword was doing fearful execution among the scattered banditti, before Stockton well knew in what direction to turn to meet his enemy. But the power which he had thus so lately gained, was too sweet, and had called for too much toil and danger, to be yielded without a violent struggle: and, if mere brute courage could have availed for his safety, the outlaw might still have escaped the consequences of his indiscretion. He rallied his men with promptness, enforced their courage by the exhibition of his own; and his numbers, being still superior to the small force which had followed Conway through the woods, the effect of his first surprise was overcome, and the issue of the conflict soon grew doubtful. But it did not long remain so. The division from below soon struck in, and the outlaws gave way. They broke at length, and endeavoured to find safety by flying up the banks of the river; but here they were met by the third division, and their retreat entirely cut off. Hemmed in on every side, assured that no quarter would be given them, they asked for none, but fought and died upon the ground to which they had been forced. It was the fortune of Stockton to fall under the sabre of Clarence Conway; while Darcy, leaping into the river perished beneath a blow from the clubbed rifle of John Bannister, whose boat, a moment after, touched the shore. Nothing could exceed the rapturous expressions of his wild whoop of joy at this unlooked-for meeting,—meeting with his friend and leader, in a moment of such complete victory, amply atoned to him for all the trials, risks and anxieties to which he had been exposed, from the night of their separation. Not one of the Black Riders escaped the conflict. The greater number fell beneath the swords of their conquerors; but some few, in their desperation, leapt into the Congaree, which finally engulfed them all. Clarence Conway, after the close of the conflict, devoted a few painful moments to the examination of the bloody field. But John Bannister threw himself between his commander and one of the victims of the day. The eye of Clarence, searchingly fell on that of his follower; and he at once divined the meaning of the interruption. “It's here then, that he lies, John? How did he die?” “Yes, Clarence, there he is;—a rifle bullet kept off a worse eending. He died like a brave man, though it mou't be, he didn't live like a good one. Leave the rest to me, Clarence. I'll see that he's put decently out of sight. But you'd better push up and see Miss Flora, and the old lady. I reckon they've had a mighty scary time of it.” “I thank you, John. I will look but once on the son of my father, and leave the rest to you.” “It's a ragged hole that a rifle bullet works in a white forehead, Clarence; and you'll hardly know it;” said the scout as he reluctantly gave way before the extended hand of his superior. Clarence Conway gazed in silence for a space upon the inanimate and bloody form before him; a big tear gathered slowly in his eyes, but he brushed away the intruder with a hasty hand; while he turned once more to meet his followers who were slowly gathering in the back grounds. He felt, even at that moment, a cheering sensation, as he knew that his brother had fallen by another hand than his. That pang, at least, was spared him; and for the rest, the cause of sorrow was comparatively slight. “He could have lived;” he murmured as he turned away from the bloody spectacle—“He could have lived only as a dishonoured and a suspected man. His path would have been stained with crime, and dogged by enemies. It is better that it is thus! May God have mercy on his soul!” Our story is on the threshold of the conclusion. We have little more to say. Flora Middleton and her lover were soon reconciled, and the misunderstanding between them easily and promptly explained. Jacob Clarkson and John Bannister were living and sufficient witnesses to save Clarence Conway the necessity of answering for himself, and of denouncing his late kinsman. Between unsophisticated and sensible people, such as we have sought to make them appear, there could be no possibility of a protracted session of doubts, misgivings, shynesses and suspicions, which a frank heart and a generous spirit, could not breathe under for a day, but which an ingenious novelist could protract through a term of years, and half a dozen volumes. In the course of a brief year following these events, the British were beaten from the country, and Clarence and Flora united in the holy bonds of matrimony. The last was an event which nobody ever supposed was regretted by either. John Bannister lived with them at the barony, from the time of their marriage, through the pleasant seasons of a protracted life. Many of our readers may remember to have seen the white-headed old man who, in his latter days, exchanged his sobriquet of Supple Jack, for one more dignified, though, possibly, less popular among the other sex. He was called “Bachelor Bannister,” towards the closing years of his life, and, in the presence of the ladies, did not quarrel with the designation. His long stories about the Revolution, of his own feats and those of Clarence Conway, were remembered and repeated by him, with little variation, to the last. In this he differed considerably from ordinary chroniclers of the old school, simply, perhaps, because his stories were originally more truthful, and his memory, in spite of his years, which were “frosty but kindly,” was singularly tenacious to the end. Our narrative has been compiled from particulars chiefly gained, though at second-hand, from this veracious source. John Bannister lived long enough to see the eldest son of Clarence Conway almost as good a marksman with the rifle, and as supple a forester, as he himself had been in his better days; and his dying moments were consoled by the affectionate offices of those, whom, with a paternal wisdom, he had chosen for his friends from the beginning. It may be stated, en passant, that one exquisite, Mr. Surgeon Hillhouse, neither lost his life nor his wardrobe in the conflict at Middleton Barony. He survived his wounds and saved his baggage. His self-esteem was also preserved, strange to say, in spite of all his failures with the sex. He was one whom Providence had wondrously blessed in this particular. Of self-esteem he had quite as many garments, if not more, than were allotted to his person. He certainly had a full and fresh suit for every day in the year. THE END.</field>
