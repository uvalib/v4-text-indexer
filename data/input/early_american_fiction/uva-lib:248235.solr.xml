      <field name="fulltext">HERMAN DE RUYTER: BY PROFESSOR J. H. INGRAHAM. Entered according to act of Congress, in the year 1844, In the Clerk's Office of the District of Massachusetts, by H. L. Williams. CHAPTER I. The Book-man's Stall. It was a few minutes past nine o'clock three evenings previous to the sudden disappearance of the beautiful `Cigar-Vender,' whose adventurous life, up to that time, has afforded us the subject of a former Tale, when the keeper of a miserable book-stall situated in a narrow thoroughfare leading from Pearl into Chatham street, prepared to close his stall for the night. His stall consisted of some rude shelfs placed against the wall of a low and wretched habitation, with a sunken door on one side of the shelves by which he had ingress from the side-walk into a dark narrow apartment that served him as a dwelling-place. There were shelves against the street wall on both sides of his door, a board placed in front of which, encroaching about two feet upon the pavement formed a sort of counter. It was supported at each end by rough empty boxes, in the cavity of one of which, upon a bundle of straw as it stood on end, facing inward, lay a small, ugly shock-dog with a black turn-up nose, and most fiery little gray eyes. In the opposite box, vis-a-vis to the little spiteful dog crouched a monstrous white Tom cat, with great green eyes, and a visage quite as savage as that of a panther. Thus with the counter and the boxes supporting it, the keeper was enclosed in a sort of ingeniously constructed shop, which he had contrived to cover by a strip of canvass, which served as a shade from the sun as well as a shelter from the storms. The contents of his shelves presented to the passer-by a singular assemblage of old books, pamphlets, songs, pictures of pirates and buccaneers hung in yellow-painted frames; two-penny portraits of murderers and other distinguished characters in this line, with ferocious full lengths of General Jackson, and Col. Johnson killing Tecumseh! Rolls of ballads, piles of sailor's songs of the last war, last dying speeches and lives of celebrated criminals, were strewn upon the counter, to which was added a goodly assortment of children's picture books and toys. Cigars and even candy were displayed to tempt the various tastes of the passers-by, and even gay ribbons, something faded, exposed in a pasteboard box were offered as a net to catch the fancy of the females who might glance that way. The whole stall with its treasures, was lighted by a tin lamp suspended by a piece of twine from a nail above the door which gave admittance to the little dark room behind the stall. The light fell full upon the person and features of the keeper, as he lifted his face while removing from their places some of the prints which had garnished the rough wall of his tenement, preparatory to restoring them to a box in his room from which he had taken them when he opened and arranged his stall in the morning. This man was low in stature and squarely framed, with a high protuberance between his shoulders, nearly level with the top of his head. He was also lame, his left leg being shrunk and drawn up so that for the most part when he stood, he stood on but one leg, with difficulty touching the ground with the toe of the other when he walked. The man's head was finely shaped, and its expression intelligent. His hair was a soft brown, and curled with a grace and beauty about his neck that singularly contrasted the unsightly aspect of his figure. He seemed to be proud of this, for it was trimmed and oiled with the greatest care, and arranged about his high, white forehead with the most fastidious taste. The features of the man were finely cut, were even noble in their cast; but a bitter sneer, a sinister, dark expression of in-dwelling malignity deformed them, and made them repulsive, and himself feared. Yet this man had been born with a heart as gentle as an angel's and he grew up with feelings overrunning with benevolence, and the love of his species. A fairer, purer, holier spirit of universal love never inhabited the human bosom. His eye beamed sweetness and tenderness upon all, and his heart, filled to the brim with love, sent forth a hundred streams to irrigate and enrich everywhere the soil of human affection. He loved all, and yearned for that sympathy with his love, which is love's nourishment! But as he grew from boyhood to manhood, as the dear, domestic circle which had surrounded him, with a chain of tenderest affection, link by link dropped away into the grave, and he was at length left exposed without the covered shield of a mother's or a sister's love, to the cold gaze and unfeeling mockery of the outer world, how like the sensitive plant, his heart shrunk up and folded itself within itself! how his spirit withered as the flower withers before the sudden frost. Then he learned his deformity! Then he learned that men despised him! Then he felt that he was not loved! How bitter was the anguish of that conviction! From that hour a change came over the amiable and loving spirit! His love gradually grew to hatred as he grew to manhood, and he felt that he was at feud with his kind. Yet, at times, as he struggled on for subsistence, for he had been left poor, he strove to find some one to love— some one to love him! His heart was yearning daily in secret for a soul kindred with his own! His only solace was books. He read, read, read that in the world of other's minds he might become oblivious of the dark thoughts of his own. When he was thrown upon his own exertions, and found every avenue to honorable exertion closed to him on account of his de formity, when he found that men turned from him with contempt, he ceased to mingle with men: he resolved to be independent of their favor. With a little money, but a dollar or two, which he possessed, he purchased a few books and placed himself near the Park to sell them. He had no other stall than a basket. He read constantly. He asked no one to buy of him; he solicited no man's favorable attention to his little stock. Yet he sold a few books daily, and by degrees increased his store. He then opened a little stall in the quarter of the town in which Herman de Ruyter had lived, where he is first introduced to the reader. Time passed on, and we now find him where he is again brought to our notice in an obscure lane, in the act of closing his little stall. He had still yearned for the love of some one of his kind in vain. But he had found none, and then he sought the love of the brute creation; but even the noble dog he would have won to his side to love him with that attachment peculiar to his race, shunned his advances. At length one day the ugly little shock-dog which now lay in the box by his side, being persecuted for its very ugliness by boys, fled for shelter under his stall. He extended to the miserable creature his protection, and from that hour the grateful animal remained with him and showed towards him the profoundest gratitude and most touching affection. Not long afterwards he saw a man passing his stall with a hideous and fierce looking cat with a stone tied to its neck. The pitiable condition of the animal moved him to save her; for he felt that, like himself, she was an outcast. He prevailed on the man to surrender her to him, although warned that the fierce creature was too savage to be suffered to go loose. But from the day the Deformed Book-man took her she manifested towards him only the kindest attachment. Thus the three had lived together many months, being the whole family of the stall-man. By day they sat on either side of him, as he read in his books, or waited in silence on his customers, at night they shared his little room, one sleeping at his feet the other at his head. Such was the character, person, profession, companions, and domestic arrangement of Rolfe Brant, or `the Book-man,' as he was most generally called. He was in the act of removing his last parcel of musty books from his counter into his rear room, in which at night this outcast of his kind safely locked up his goods, himself and his two favorites, when a young man in the dress of a seaman who was passing by, stopped and gazed full and intensely upon the form of Brant, whose back was towards him. The light of the stall lamp shone full upon the stranger, who was well dressed in a blue sailor's round-about open before, with full white trowsers, a black handkerchief loosely knotted in front and was without a vest, better to display his fine blue shirt, which lay in careless folds across his manly chest. He was tall and symmetrical, with a bold free bearing, which was sustained by a fine dark countenance, shaded by locks of raven black hair that swept his shoulders. A mustache darkened his upper lip, and gave strength and energy to the expression of a face as determined as it was handsome. He stood gazing upon the Book-man with a look partly of recognition, partly of surprise. At length Brant turned half-round to call to his dog and cat to follow him into the house. As he did so, and the features of his countenance were strongly revealed in profile under the lamp, the young man uttered an exclamation of recognition and pleasure. With a light curled rattan which he carried he reached over the counter and struck the stall-keeper lightly upon the shoulder to draw his attention. At the act the shaggy shock-dog bristling up his back and showing his teeth sprung from the box, uttered a fierce yelp of rage and vindictiveness and flying at him fastened his sharp fangs in his leg, while the huge Tom cat leaped like a hyena upon hi breast and clung there mouthing and spitting like an enraged ape, and savagely tearing at his bosom with her sharp claws. The Book-man had, also, at the same moment turned to see who gave the blow. `Rolfe! man! Brant! What the devil! Call off your cats and imps!' cried the young seaman as he struggled to free himself from these assailants. `Do you mean an old friend shall be torn to pieces in this way?' And as he spoke he seized the huge cat in both hands by the throat and with difficulty disengaged him, bringing away with his claws bleeding portions of his blue checked shirt. He was about to dash him to the pavement and then liberate himself from the dog which still vindictively tugged at his leg, when Rolfe cried, pressing forward and grasping the cat also, `Herman, hurt him not' He is all I love, or that loves me save Pest! Away, Pest! Let go and into your house, sir!' he cried to the shock-dog; which, giving another sharp bite to the tendon he had fastened upon with his teeth, sulkily retired as far as the door and there sat on his haunches and with his long hair bristling like a porcupine's quill's, contented himself with growling in a most snappish and ill-natured way. In the meanwhile the young man had released his hold on the Tom-cat and Brant had dropped him upon the ground saying kindly, `Go in, Snowy! You are too quick, you and Pest both of you!' `Quick as the flash of a gun, Rolfe! What the devil do you keep such impish beasts about you for?' he demanded staunching the trickling blood that flowed freely from the scratch in his breast, and stooping down to examine his ancle. `Confound that little black brute! His teeth are like needles! The fellow has met his jaws through the skin.' `I am sorry you have met with such a reception, Herman,' said Rolfe, in a tone of more gentleness than was his wont. `Come in, and I will try and see what I can do for you?' `Never mind. They are mere scratches! Musketoe bites! They are sharp but they are little fellows those friends of yours, Rolfe, and are not worth noticing! The scratches will be well enough in a day or too. I am too impatient to think about any thing till I hear where and how my mother is. I have just now, within the last hour got in from two years absence at sea, and was hastening up to the Post Office to see if there was any letter from her there for me. When I sailed she was living in Boston, and I have had letters regularly from her or Maria, until six months past, since when I have not had a word.' `You need not go to the Post Office to-night, Herman, as the hour for keeping it open has passed. Besides your mother is in New York!' `In New York?' exclaimed Herman with surprise. `Yes. She has been living here three months at least!' `How do you know this?' `I have seen her pass here often in that time, and always with such things in her hands as leads me to know she keeps house and is not visiting!' `And—and—my friend who gives such good news, tell me is she well? Looked she well?' asked Herman earnestly. `I have now closed my stall, and your wounds are troublesome to you. Come into my little room and with some cotton I have there I will staunch the blood and then we will talk more at ease!' Herman looked suspiciously at Pest and Snow who sat on their haunches on either side of the door, when Brant, catching the direction of his glances, made a motion of his hand. Both obeyed by retiring from the door and seating themselves at the foot of a low truckle bed, one at one post, the other at the other post, from which respective positions they kept up a most vigilant watch upon the intruder, from time to time exchanging glances with each other of the most unmitigated suspicion of the intentions of the stranger; for many a month had past since human foot step had crossed the threshold of their solitary master. Herman stooped to enter the door of the low apartinent and the book-man having taken down his lamp from the nail outside, closed the door and turned a ponderous key in an enormous lock. There was no chair in the room, and Herman seated himself upon a heap of books, while his host occupied the side of the bed. The lamp stood upon a low mantle, beneath which, in a broken fire-place, were a few utensils for cooking. `It is a long time since we met, Herman,' said Brant after surveying the young man closely. `Yet you knew me at the first glance!' `I never forget the faces of men,' said Brant, with emphasis. `You recognised me at once!' he added with severe irony. `Yes, Brant! I —' `Enough. You need not tell me what I know, that God has given me Cain's mark! So you are returned from sea! You have grown. You are tall and noble looking, Herman! Such as you are now you promised to be when you were a boy!' `You have not changed, Rolfe,' said Herman looking at him closely. `Do you remember that it was you who first told me about my father's being in prison? From that day, Brant, the seeds of the devil's wickedness were sown in my heart. A recklessness seized upon me, and I felt a wild joy in making shipwreck of all the good and virtuous principles my mother, my good and noble mother had so carefully instilled into my heart —hoping that if I could be kept ignorant of my father's crimes I might grow up an honest man!' `I remember that time! I pitied you then, Herman, when I saw the anguish with which you heard the tale of your father's criminal deeds. I told it you not in malice, boy, for I was not then so profoundly the hater of my species as I am now. Yet I hate not all men. I find that kindly feelings are still in my heart when I see you. You did me a kindness then, and I have never forgotten it. You did me the only kind act man has done me since my sister and mother died and left me a blot on God's earth for every heartless being, perchance, who stands erect to spit his venom on!' The dark, deep sunken eyes of Brant glowed as he spoke and thought of his wrongs from his kind. `You take it too much at heart, Brant. People don't hate you, so much as you think. It is most in your fancy! But what of my mother? When did you see her last?' `On Monday morning.' `How did she look? Well?' `Thin and poor!' `Poor? It is impossible. She had means!' `Yet she looked poor and sad!' `I hope not! Did you speak to her?' `I speak to nobody first, Herman?' `Was she alone always. Did you not see any one with her?' he asked eagerly. `Tell me quickly, Brant? `But once have I seen her pass with any one,' aaswered the Deformed, his countenance changing, and an extraordinary expression passing over it. `And who—who was this? was it Maria?' Who do you mean, Herman? Once before you spoke of Maria, as having written you? Of whom do you speak?' This question was put in a tone of calmness, so calm that it was plainly assumed to conceal any opposite emotion that his voice might betray. `Of — but you do not know, either! We left the city directly, and he could not know,' said Herman to himself, the dark, intellectual observing eyes of Brant resting upon his face the while with the closest scrutiny. `Why it my sister!' he answered after a moment's hesitation and deeply coloring; for he saw at once that any other confession would be imprudent. `I never knew you had a sister. I knew your father, that is as I knew other men, and I knew no tthat he had two children. It may be so!' `May be so? Do you doubt my word, Brant?' cried Herman, his handsome countenance darkening, and the indications of his fiery nature, manifesting themselves in every lineament. `No, Herman,' answered Brant, a smile scarcely perceptible, creeping about the corners of his sarcastic mouth. `No Herman, I doubt not but that you had a sister! Doubtless, she has another mother than thine, eh?' `Was the person you saw with my mother young and beautiful and about—let me see— about seventeen she must be by this time!' asked Herman letting the suspicion pass. `Such was her description. Both young and beautiful,' answered the Dwarf, with a look of extraordinary melancholy and feeling. `I saw such a maiden passing once with your mother!' `Had she blue eyes and fair hair, with a sweet look and gentle smile?' `You have described her, Herman,' replied Brant sighing, then recovering himself, and frowning, and biting his lips. `I saw her once, only once! Till now,' he continued with animation, I knew not who she was! Thy sister! It is good, Herman. I thank thee for thy news.' As he spoke the last words, his face assumed an expression of singular decision of inward purpose, and he seemed to have spoken absently to himself, rather than addressed them to Herman. The young man did not regard the expression of his countenance, being at the moment busily watching the furtive manœuvres of Pest, who had left his bed-post and seemed to be stealing around the room for the purpose of making, as he supposed, further demonstrations of hostility. The eye of his master, however, arrested him, and he turned and went snapping his teeth back to his place. `What an imp of Satan you have there, Brant! Well, I am glad to hear from my mother. I can't imagine what can have brought her back to New York, But for meeting you I should have posted off to Boston to-morrow. Thanks, good Ralfe; now if you can tell me how to find her out, I shall be your debtor doubly!' `That I can't do, Herman; though she lives in this neighborhood I am confident. I have wished to ascertain since the —' here the Dwarf suddenly checked himself, and added, `since I saw she looked so poor; for I would gladly have assisted her for your sake, Herman. So she is his sister?' he added to himself, with a glowing cheek, and an eye and lip eloquent with some strange and deep emotion of the soul within, `So she is his sister! It may be, and may be not? 'Tis strange!' `Well, Rolfe, good night! You can't assist me farther, and I must go where I can get information. Yet I dont know where to take the first step forward?' `Herman,' said Ralfe suddenly, `do you recollect your father?' `I? No!' `Would you like to know that he was free? Would you like to see him?' The young man stood and looked at his interrogater with intense surprise for several seconds. `Is my father still living?' he demanded hoarsely. `Yes. I ask you would you like to see him?' Herman was silent a moment, and then replied; `Brant I ought not to wish to see my father but to curse him; for, but for his crime I should not have been the man I am? I do not know,—I cannot say whether I would like to see him or not! Is he at liberty!' `I saw him pass here this very day!' `My father?' `Yes.' `How looked he?' `As he did fourteen years ago, though gray hairs were mixed with his black locks. He was something bent, yet his frame was strong and his step bold!' `How was he clad?' `Illy.' `He is my father too! I should like to see him, not to be known to him,' answered Herman thoughtfully. `How has he become free?' `His sentence was for life; but after serving fourteen years the Governor has pardoned him. I knew he was out for I saw it in the papers last week!' `I would give much to see him!' answered Herman with thoughtful earnestness. `I would give much to behold my father!' he added with a deeper tone that seemed to come from the depths of his chest. `You will find him, doubtless at the Saracen's Head, for I saw him in company with a rare villain who haunts there!' `I will see him, then,' answered Herman decidedly. `Think you my mother has met him?' he inquired with a flashing eye. `No, Yet 'tis possible through him, you may learn where she is, as he would be likely to seek her out!' `Then I go at once to the Saracen's head,' he answered going to the door, which the stall-keeper opened for him. `When you have made the discovery let me know, Herman? now, good night. I have entertained you as my guest which I would never do for any other man!' `No man would come to visit you often, to have such a reception as your imps gave me. You must have a strange fancy for ugliness, Rolfe, to keep such savage brutes about you. But no matter, the scars are done bleeding, and I don't mind it, if they are not poisoned! Well, good night. I will drop in to see you to-morrow' Thus speaking Herman de Ruyter went up out of the low den which served the Book-man for a habitation, and rapidly took his way up the street in the direction of the Saracen's Head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. The Saracen's Head. The `Saracen's Head,' towards which Herman directed his step after quitting the wretched stall of the Book-man, was situated at the head of the narrow street he was traversing, and in the neighborhood of the City Prison, the dark Egyptian, walls of which towered high and frowningly above it. It was at the corner with a door on either side, and above the angle projecting over the narrow side-walk was a rude sign-board on which was pictured a rude representation of a Turk's Head in a green turban and an enormous blue beard, The building was two low stories in height, with a hip-roof and dormer windows; the roof steep and much broken in places, and the windows set with very small bull's eye panes The house was sunken several feet below the pavement, partly from age and partly by the gradual elevation and levelling of the streets that it faced upon. It had once been red but was now a dingy brown and had the appearance, altogether, of a tavern of the lowest order. It had originally been square, but various additions to its length on either wing had given it a rambling over-laden look; and as these additions were in every possible variety as suited the purse or taste of the owner of the tenement, they added much to its picturesque aspect, as well as increased his income; for the apartments, some under ground, some above ground, and some stuck upon the roof like one cage placed a-top of another, being let out to various tenants, added not a little to the income of the economical landlord. The renter of this rambling row of tenements was the hostes of `Saracen's Head,' who not only kept on the corner a famous tap-room, which she styled a `Coffee House,' in red letters on a pinkground, placed over the principal door, but let `furnished lodgings' at eleven York shilling's a week, or `a single bed' for ninepence. Dame Dilley, or as she was better known, `Dirk Dilley,' from her habit of carrying a dirk sheathed in her girdle, did not only let rooms to lodgers, but she rented by the week and month, apartments in the more remote quarters of her habitation attached to the Saracen's Head. Thus she had under her miscellaneous union of roofs no less than nine families who rented rooms of her independent of the `Coffee House,' poor people who furnished their own quarters, such furnishing as it was, and lived as they could, whether by theft or honest industry, Dirk Dilley never made it her business to inquire so that she got her weekly dues for rent.— Some of these families got to their apartments by a door on the street in a line with the `Coffee House; others reached them by going in a narrow passage a few steps and clambering up a damp, miserable flight of steps, here and there one of the decayed boards missing; while others passed from the side walk through a cellar door, and traversing a sort of underground passage, dark at noon-day, emerged in the rear of the tavern into the yard of the house. This yard or court was narrow, and closely built round by wooden sheds two stories high, the lower portion being used for wood and washroom, while the upper story was let out to her tenants; a narrow platform which was reached by a flight of steps at one end running around beneath the second row of windows, with half a dozen doors opening from it into the rooms occupied by them. Such was the character of the externals of the Saracens Head. As Herman approached this rendezvous of vice, poverty and crime, he instinctively slackened his pace; for he did not know but he might the next moment meet his father, and the thought made his blood flow quicker while it produced a certain emotion of reluctance and awe. Around the door were four or five persons smoking cigars and talking together. Two men muffled about the chin and mouth, and wearing hats pushed down over their brows, evidently for disguise, stood beneath the dull lamp which hung above the door of the `tap,' conversing apart secretly. As Herman came up they lowered their voices and turned their faces away, shaded as the spot was where they were standing. He knew one of them, nevertheless, disguised as he was, and approaching him he laid his hand suddenly upon his arm. The man started back, and throwing himself into an attitude of defence, half unsheathed a knife, the steel of which flashed on the eyes of De Ruyter. His companion at the same moment drew from beneath his jacket a short, loaded cudgel and held it above his head. `Wilkins, is this the way to welcome an old acquantance,' said Herman in a lively tene and a pleasant laugh, without betraying the least fear at their menacing demeanor. `Who the deuce are you?' demanded the man he addressed, slowly shoving back his knife into its sheath and eyeing him closely. `If you know me, you ought to know it is dangerous for a man to come up and lay a hand upon me in that way by surprise. I might take his life before I knew whether he was friend or foe! Who are you?' `Herman de Ruyter,' he answered, firmly. `Herman!' cried the burglar captain with a recognition of surprise and pleasure. And seizing him by the extended hand he warmly shook it. `You are the last man I expected to see here! No wonder I didn't know you You were but seventeen when we last met and now you are full three and twenty! But your way of carrying yourself is just the same, and you have an eye no man could mistake who had once seen it! You knew me readily. If I have been so easily detected I am not safe here!' `I heard your voice first, and then looking at you closely I recognised you. Perhaps I houldn't have noticed you if I had not heard you speak!' `Softly,' said the burglar captain, lowering his voice. `Come into the tap, Herman, my boy, and let us know where you've been! You are the very man I would rather see than all others! By the by, this is my particular friend Napes!' Herman shook Mr. Napes by the hand and then followed his two friends into the coffee house, by descending four well-worn steps, the tap being three feet lower than the level of the street. The door was carefully closed by Wild, and being half glass was habitually guarded by a faded red curtain drawn across the panes. The door on the other street was arranged with an under curtain in the same manner; thus the orgies going on within, could not be overlooked, or rather looked down upon by those passing on the walk. The apartment into which Herman descended was a large sized room, remarkable for its time-worn and smoky aspect, and for the lowness of its blackened ceiling. Its floor had been sanded, the time when being doubtful, but the sand had now united with the dirt brought in by the feet of Dirk Dilley's guests and covered the boards with a hard cement not unlike a macadamised surface. Over this was strewn bits of half-smoked cigars, fragments of refreshments, and around the bar at the opposite end it was damp with water and other liquids spilled or dashed upon it. There were little blue tables ranged around the sides of the room, and every one of them was occupied by hard looking characters, some card-playing, others drinking and puffing at short pipes or detestable cigars, others with their heads bent close together conversing in low, cautious tones. A steady buzz, mingled with oaths of the most horrible character and language singularly vile, filled the room, alternated with loud calls for glasses of wine or tumblers of spirits. Dame Dilley stood behind her bar the presiding genius of this bacchanalian scene. Her appearance presented a striking contrast to all around her. She was a young woman not more than five or six and twenty, and still remarkably handsome, with a clear hazel eye, dark shining hair, and a superb figure. She was dressed in a tight-fitting black velvet spencer, with a green silk skirt, and a necklace of sparkling stones encircled her well-turned neck. She was at once beautiful and wicked; for the seal of vice was impressed upon her fine face in lines that could not be mistaken. In a word the hostess of the Saracen's Head was Isabel Wild, once the wife of the burglar captain. After his sentence to seven years in the States Prison**, her marriage with him was, by the law, annulled. She passed through various vicissitudes the past two or three years of her separation, but in all her circumstance was remarkable for her bold, daring and independent spirit, and a propensity to defy the law by engaging in lawless enterprizes. Indeed, she took for a time the position Wilkins Wild had held and was virtually the head of a band of burglars for whom she planned enterprizes, being artful, bold and most accomplished in the management of conspiracies against the property of honest citizens. One of these, by the name of Dilley, she married; but he was shot not long afterwards in breaking into a Doctor's house in Washington square. Avarice grew with her acquisitions and her depredations through the skilful persons she had in her employ at length rendering her discovery and arrest an object of great importance to the police, she resolved to abandon her career as a successful female burglar, and invest her money, while she could do it safely in a way that would enable her to enrich herself. At first she opened a boarding house for the friends of `the art,' as she termed burglary, charging them a high price for the advantages she could afford them by her protection, as well as by her advice; and ultimately she got to eharging a fee for consultation upon nice points touching any contemplated `descent.' But she carefully kept herself from all participation in the acts themselves. By degrees her boarding house assumed the character of a tavern, and finding the Saracen's Head to rent, she removed there about three years after Wilkins had been sentenced to Sing-Sing, and gradually increasing the number of her rooms, she had at length got under her domestic government quite a colony to which she was a most exacting and uncompromising governor. In the collection of her rents, or bills for lodging or board, Isabel Dilley knew no pity. The last loaf of bread or the last blanket that appertained to her poor tenants she would seize without mercy if the hour of her dues came and there was not money enough to pay. As she stood now in her bar, not serving herself so much as overseeing the movements of a young girl who was in the bar with her, her hard cold, yet handsome eye, betrayed to a close observer all the iron-coldness of her nature. Yet it was not her nature. Isabel Wild was not always such as she now was; and under other circumstances might have made a noble woman. But early temptation and fall had reversed her character, and from a high-spirited girl, made a dangerous and guilty woman! As Herman followed Wild up to the bar, she fixed upon him her quick glance, and a look of surprise and searching scrutiny of his features followed. He at once recognized her and turned to Wilkins, exclaimed, `There is your wife—Isabel?' `Not my wife now,' answered Wild laughing, yet looking confused and displeased. `The state's prison gave us a bill of divorce! She has recognized you, and beckons to me to bring you there!' Wild led Herman by the side of the bar into a small setting room, into which Isabel instantly came. `Is it possible,' she exclaimed with a smiling countenance, as she stopped a moment to survey Herman, `is it possible Wild, you have brought little Herman here! It is he! That smile and glance no body can mistake! How handsome and tall you've grown! she added as she approached him, and laid her hand upon his shoulder. `Where have you been?' `At sea!' `Under the free flag, hey?' she said laughing. `No,' replied Herman. `I have been part the time in a merchantman, and a part of the time in a man-of-war. I only got back from my last cruise to-night, and I want you to tell me, Isabel, where I can find my mother?' `Isabel! I like that! You remind me of old times, Herman;' she said as if pleased. `How very fine looking you are! Your seaman's dress is truly becoming, and you wear it with such an air! Come, we must be good friends again, now you have got back. So you were kind to come and see me first! Have you been to supper?' `Yes, before I came ashore!' answered Herman, gratified at the warm reception by her. `I cannot stop a moment either, as I am anxious to see my mother!' `Your mother! Bless me, you are too old to ask after your mother, Herman, she said laughing. `She is n't living is she?' `Yes, and is in the city!' `Well, I did not know it! Besides I never saw her in my life! Where are you going to stop while you are here? You must remain at the Saracen! I have a neat room for you, and you will feel perfectly at home!' `Well, I will accept your kind offer,' said Herman, `until I ascertain where my mother is!' `Bel,' said Wild in an imperious tone, `bring us in three glasses of your best. We will drink together in here, where it is private!' `Who do you order in that manner, sir?' asked the hostess of the Saracer, her large eyes flashing, and her fine lip curling with contempt. `Your old tones wont do with me now, Wilkins? If you wish me to be your friend, you will be less haughty. We are two now! If I suffer you to lodge here for old acquaintance sake till you can do better, it is not for you to think that I am your wife!' `Dont be angry, Isabel,' said Wild trying to laugh, though his brow darkened. `We will keep friends! Come, my dear, get us the three glasses, and a fourth too, for yourself!' `No, I will take a glass, with a cup of tea, by and by alone with Herman!' `Alone with Herman, eh!' repeated Wild in a sarcastic tone, and with a look that showed, that notwithstanding his present relative position with regard to her, he was jealous of her very apparent regard for Herman. She smiled with wicked triumph in her eye, and entering the bar, in a few moments returned with the glasses and placed them upon the table before them. As she retired from the room, Wild rose up and followed her to the door of the bar. `Isabel!' `Well, Wild?' `I see how the wards lay, and have a key in my eye that unlocks all your thoughts! I understand what you mean to be at!' `Well, what is it?' `You know Herman is rich, and will soon have his money. You see he is devilish good looking. So you mean to play a double game; getting him fascinated with you to gratify your vanity, and then work him out of his money!' `If I thought it would make you jealous, nothing would please me more, Wild, than to fall in love with him. The truth is I am almost in love with him; and I tell you plainly if I can catch him I will marry him!' `Do as you please, only beware!' said Wild, his fine, yet vice-hardened face glowing with anger. `But look you, woman! About his money, there are two to play at that game!' `How do you mean?' `If you make me jealous of him, I will so manage my cards, that you shall not touch a dollar of his money. I know your avarice is stronger than your love, and so take heed! I do not, you well know, threaten lightly! If you wish to profit by his return, you must make me your friend!' `Well, Wilkins, I will not do any thing to vex you! The truth is I do love you still; but then my hatred of you for deceiving and degrading me in the first, is so much stronger than love, that sometimes it will come to the surface; and then I feel as I could do any thing to make you suffer in soul and body!' `Never make me jealous, Isabel!' said Wild in a stern tone, depressed so as not to be overheard by Herman and Napes. `If I can be nothing more to you again than another man, no other shall share your affections. Dont touch your dirk! It will not intimidate me! I am as desperate and determined as hell itself on that point. So if you would not make me your enemy, beware!' He then turned away from her, while with a pale cheek yet flashing eyes she entered her bar. `You and Dirk Dilley seem to have been at words,' said Napes, as Wild sat down by the table and raised his glass. `You seem to have been listening,' retorted Wild ill-humoredly. `But let us drink,' he said his brow clearing up. Come, Herman, here is to your health!' `Wilkins,' said Herman as he sat down his glass, can you tell me if—' and here looking doubtfully at Napes he lowered his tone and and added—`if my father is in the city!' `Bless me! I never thought of it before! That is true sure enough! What a meeting it would be! I should like to be present at it!' `He is here then?' Yes. But talk freely; don't be afraid of Napes. He knows all about you and the old 'un too! He's served his three years!. `Have you seen him?' `Not half an hour ago. I dare say he is about now! I will see!' `No—by no means!' cried Herman catching him by the arm and detaining him. `I have not seen my father since I was a lad. I do not wish him to know me when we do meet! Yet I would like to see him!' `You shall see him. He lodges here. He has a room with Napes in the court-yard right over the arch. We will go up all three to his room soon and see him. I will call you Corney. He has heard me speak of such a person and won't suspect!' `Thank you, Wilkins,' said Herman with an earnest voice. `I don't want him to know me, at least, yet!' `Well, now let us have a little talk together. How are you as it regards the old trade?' `I have done with all that, Wilkins! I had enough when I was a boy in that way to serve me!' `Yes, you used to do service! By the by, was Shears killed before or after you left the city? Oh, I remember it was about the time; for you were together a night or two before! That was the strangest affair!' `It was,' responded Napes with emphasis. `I would give a hundred dollars to know how the poor fellow came by his death!' `Has the person never been suspected?' asked Herman with as much composure as he could assume at such a moment. `Never! unless it was a little girl whom he was known to take into the carriage with him. It seems impossible it could have been this child; and that afterwards she should cut her way through the leather at the back of the coach. Yet the child disappeared at the same time as if guilty; and her father or uncle, Mr. Carrol, used every means to ascertain what had become of her. It is a confoundedly mysterious affair!' `So it is,' warmly answered Napes, who was a young, slender, pale faced man of thirty, in a gray jacket buttoned to his chin, with black, straight hair, cut very short to his head, and eyes large, green, and consumptive looking. His countenance was expressive of the most hardened villany, Every feature seemed to be attenuated and sharpened by duplicity and cunning. He spoke through his nose, and had a habit of jirking the corner of his mouth towards his left ear; and a look of cautious watchfulness was so habitual to him that one could not behold him without irresistably thinking of a cat. Herman kept his countenance with remarkably coolness, and said quietly. `It is very singular. I heard of the facts before I left.' `Shears was one in a thousand,' said Wild with admiration in his tones, as he recalled the many virtues of the skillful burglar. `I would not have lost him for a good deal of money. Well, Herman, I suppose you are soon to be rich! I am not mistaken, hey?' `I was to have about twenty thousand dollars when I came of age, which was nearly two years ago. I hope it is now safe; though if I hear rightly my mother is in the city and in poverty.' `It can't be true! But you will find her tomorrow, by dropping a line in the office. So you will cut us all after you get your money, I dare say.' No, I shall not cut you,' he answered smiling; `but there will be no need I should take a hand with you.' `Ah, the same old frank, bold spirit, I see! You are Herman still! Going to sea hasn't spoiled you.' `It has made me reflect a good deal. I intend to stay ashore quietly, marry and live as happily as I can.' `Here's to your good resolutions,' cried Wells filling his glass. At this moment a noise without and a loud shriek caused them to rise and rush precipitately into the tap-room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. The Forget-me-Not. Before explaining the scene that met the eyes of Herman and the others upon entering the tap-room, we will first take the reader to the tenement occupied by Mrs. de Ruyter and her young friend, the lovely cigar vender. This abode was situated upon a narrow street, or rather alley, not far distant from the `Saracen's Head,' and in a quarter where the poor congregated on account of the lowness of the rents, though such places as they inhabited scarcely were decent enough to bring any rent at all to their avaricious landlords. Upon the second floor of an old black wooden house, Mrs. de Ruyter had hired a room for herself and her protege. It was furnished in the humblest manner, and one bed in the room served for her and the maiden. In spite of the poverty which manifested itself in the chamber, there was an air of neatness that pervaded the whole. Maria had been then a few weeks in the cigar store, and her little wages had been cheerfully contributed towards the comfort of her fostermother; and the appearance of things was now quite genteel, though indigent still, compared with what they had been before the young girl obtained this uncertain situation. There was a small mirror over a table covered with neat white dimity, and a white coverlid to the bed, and clean curtains to the two low windows; all of which were presents from Maria, made out of the avails of her weekly wages. It was a little after nine o'clock in the evening, and about the time that Herman had entered the tap of the Saracen's Head, that Mrs. de Ruyter was seated at table sewing by a small lamp. Upon a seat a little lower and close by her side sat the lovely girl, whom we have chosen as the heroine of our tale. The rays of the lamp fell softly upon her pure forehead, on either side of which the fair brown hair was modestly parted, and put behind the ears, fell in two or three natural curls upon her neck. She was reading a letter aloud; and, as at intervals, she would lift up her eyelids from the paper, and fixed her deep blue eyes upon the face of her maternal friend, to listen to some remark she made upon the contents of the epistle, the expression was heavenly from its innocence and purity. As she read, a sweet ever-dwelling smile played about her mouth. She was very beautiful; but it was the beauty of the retiring daisy, rather than of the glowing rose. She was attired with great simplicity in a muslin dress, with a pink flower in it, and in her bosom was stuck a sprig of myrtle and forget-me-not. As she read, she rested her arm upon the lap of Mrs. de Ruyter, and seemed to nestle by her, as if she were her mother indeed. Her voice as she read was sweetly toned, and, at times, was slightly tremulous; for she was reading over again, at Mrs. de Ruyter's request, the last letter received many months before from Herman, dated at Valparaiso, and there were passages in it breathing the most passionate tenderness towards her. `Nay, read that passage over again, dear,' said Mrs. de Ruyter, laying down her work upon her knee, and fixing her eyes upon the letter, `read it again, my child!' `Never forget, my dear mother,' obeyed the maiden, and blushing as she obeyed, `that Maria must be regarded by you as your own child, as you promised me when I parted from you. She is very, very dear to me! I love her as a sister, as more than a sister; and it is only the hope, that one day I may be united to her by a bond still tenderer than that of brotherly love, that leads me onward in my career of usefulness! But for her I feel I should, forover, have cast myself away on learning my father's crime. But I feel differently when I think of Maria. Her image—' `Why do you stop, my child? These words are very sweet to my heart, and I know you will rejoice to be so loved by my boy! See what you have done, my dear, by your gentle and silent influence! Herman confesses he owes his safety from the gulf of crime to you! If any thing could make me love you more than I do, my child, it is this reflection!' And the grateful mother of the wandering boy, placed both her hands upon the head of the sweet maiden, and raising her eyes to Heaven, called fervently for its blessing upon her! Maria sat pale and silent. She looked distressed and said hurriedly, `I will not read any more to-night, dear mother, if you will excuse me. The light is dim and I do not feel quite well.' `Then fold up the dear boy's letter. I know you have to work hard all day and stay until eight o'clock and sometimes later in the evening. I don't wonder your head aches. The smell of so much tobacco would make mine ache constantly. Besides you have'nt been home long enough to get rested. There, the lamp is going out! I forgot to get any oil to day, and I must have this gown finished to night for Mrs. Gillin's little girl to put on in the morning. Will you remain here, alone dear, while I go to the store on the corner over against the Saracen's Head.' `You must not go, mother,' said Maria rising quickly, and taking the little oil pitcher from her hand.' `But you are too tired walking all the way from the shop in Broadway down here, and only been in about twenty minutes.' `No, I can go very well. It is but a step,' she said cheerfully; and throwing her shawl over her head was going out when the forget-me-not fell out of her bosom upon the floor. She stooped to pick it up when Madam de Ruyter anticipated her, and as she took it in her hand before returning it to her, she said, `This is beautiful, Maria. Where did you find such a sweet flower? It is a rare sight for me to see a flower in these days. It reminds me of my garden at the old place. Where did you get it?' `It was given to me,' answered the maiden, colouring, and rubbing her eyelids. `I hope you did not receive it from any of the young gentlemen who frequent your shop. I cannot caution you too closely, my sweet child; about the society you are under the necessity of seeing there. Nay, don't look grieved! You are a good girl, and know propriety as well as I do. There it is, dear Maria! If you don't care to tell how you came by it, I will not press you,' added Mrs. de Ruyter kindly. `I know you would not have received it from any young man, especially after Herman's letter.' `I am afraid the lamp will go quite out before I can get back with the oil,' said Maria, placing the flower in her bosom beside the sprig of myrtle; and, without making any further reply, she left the room and closed the door. With difficulty she found her way down a crooked and dilapidated staircase, and as she reached the street door, she said internally to herself, `This is the last night I shall have to go in and out of this wretched place. The two pretty rooms in Nassau street I have engaged, and secretly furnished with my wages, will be ready tomorrow afternoon; and then how I shall surprise my dear Mrs. de Ruyter by taking her there to see them, and then telling her they are her own! I can almost see her happy and grateful countenance beaming upon me with thankfulness and love. Ah, this flower! I wonder if she suspected truly the truth! Oh if she knew, she would be very angry with me! But how could I refuse him? so noble in looks, so agreeable, so handsome! and I know he is so generous and good! And how should I have answered my mother, when I know not even his name myself?' With these pleasant thoughts of some one who is yet a stranger to us, but of whom the maiden knew more than she was willing to confide to her, from whom, up to this time, she had kept no emotion of her heart; she tripped lightly along the murky side-walk, her delicate features nearly concealed by the shawl which she drew closely down over her forehead, and round her chin; for the walk was thronged with idlers of all classes who were lounging about, or coming in and out of the low lodging-houses and tippling-cellars that lined the way. She proceeded very rapidly along on her errand, fearing to be accosted by some rude person, and was passing the long row of tenements composing the `Saracen's Head,' when the door of the tap-room opened, and a man was coming out, when the glare falling directly upon the face of Maria as she tripped past, revealed to him a glimpse of its beauty. `Ha, my bright eyes!' he cried with drunken triumph, as he sprung and seized hold of her shawl, `let us have a sight of that pretty face.' The maiden alarmed uttered a half-cry, and releasing the shawl to his grasp, fled towards the grocery. As she was leaving the curbstone to cross the street to it, another person who had seen the act of the man, suddenly placed himself in her way, and with outspread arms tried to receive her flying, form. She turned from him, now fairly affrighted, and was about to escape by turning down the street, up which a little before Herman had come from the bookman's stall, when a third person, seeing her terror, intercepted her course, and attempted to pass his arm around her graceful waist. At this instant, when all hopes of avoiding the rude insults of these desperadoes seemed gone, the other door of the tap was thrown open by a woman, who was coming out with a bottle in her hand. At the sight of one of her sex, and the open door, the alarmed girl sprung towards her. `Protect me, good woman, from these wretches!' she cried, clinging to her. `Och, and what is it ye fare from the min'?' demanded the woman coarsely in a strong Irish brogue. `Don't be afther claverin' me wid yer hands!' and thus speaking, she drew back from her. At the same moment the man who had first alarmed her came up, and was laying his hand upon her arm, when she pushed past the unfeeling Irish woman into the tap, and sprung down the two steps through the still open door into the smoky and crowded room. No sooner did she discover the character of the place she had sought shelter in, than she trembled with renewed apprehensions, and was about to fly through the door again past the men who were entering after her, when she was caught by the wrist, and drawn forcibly back into the room. `Here is a canary bird that has broke loose from its cage!' cried the fellow who had seized her. `Don't sing so loud, pretty one, nobody is deaf here!' But the voice of the terrified girl rose louder, shriek after shriek, for three cut-throat looking villains had hold of her, and knives were already drawn above her head in fierce rivalry for the possession of her. It was the shrieks of the trembling girl that reached the ears of Herman, the burglar Captain and Napes in the little back room of the tavern, and which led them to leave their glasses, and rush out to ascertain the cause. The room being illy lighted, and its atmosphere thick with tobacco smoke, and the inmates of the tap thronging towards the door to see what was going on, Herman at first was unable to discover the cause. But being one of those ready spirits that are ever foremost in a quarrel or a scene of excitement, he pressed his way through the crowd, imperiously saying, as he did so, `Stand aside, fellow! Clear the passage here! Give me room, villains!' And in this way helping his words with strong arms, he soon reached the scene. There was a battered japan lamp hanging just above the door, and casting its light down upon the spot where the maiden stood pale as marble, and trembling with apprehension. Two men now only had hold of her, one grasping each arm, while with knives brandished in the air, they stood eyeing each other with fierce and murderous hate. `By Heaven I will kill the girl unless you let go of her, Plymp!' vociferated one of them, and he lowered his knife till the point hung just above her bosom. `Let go of her yourself, Flash,' cried the other furiously. `She is mine, for I first saw her. Let go her, or I will kill you!' Herman came at this near enough to see the features of the young girl, over whom this desperate quarrel was going on; and instantly all the blood in his heart rushed to his brain. Could it be possible? The features pale and alarmed as their expression was, were those which he had carried with him in `in his heart of hearts,' during all his wild wanderings. Changed and far more beautiful they were, but they were the same as those of the lovely child who had so generously saved him from arrest by concealing him in her closet! the same, but more matured, of the sweet maid of fifteen whom he had two years before parted from with tenderness, and in tears. The situation of any young and lovely female in such peril, would, under any circumstances, have called forth the chivalrous interference of the young sailor. How much more when he recognised in her the features of the one he loved best on earth! The recognition acted upon his brain with the force of a blow being given upon the temples. He staggered a step backwards! but instantly recovering himself as he saw the dreadful situation she was in, he uttered a loud cry, so loud and terrible that those around him started aside; and as a lion leaps upon his prey, he leaped— bounded upon these men. He had no weapon in his grasp! He seized a hand of each of them, heedless of their knives, and bending the wrists till they relaxed their brutal hold upon her shoulders, he hurled them both from him, one to this side, and the other that, as if they had been children in his grasp; and with the same act he threw his arm around the half lifeless maiden and drew her closely to his side, and with the other arm presented in fierce defiance, he cried, `Stand back, ruffians, both of ye, all of ye! He who lays a hand upon this young girl is a dead man!' The two men recovering themselves, and seeing him unarmed, sprung at him together with their gleaming blades, when Wild and Napes caught their hands and held them, each securing one of them. `How is this, Plymp—Flash! Put up your knives, would you kill the best fellow that ever worked a clasher?' `He?' cried Plymp, in a tone of contempt. `He a clasher?' `Yes, and one of us, and the girl is his sister! So quit this game, and be hanged to you!' `Just as you say, Wilks,' answered Plymp, sheathing his weapon, and followed in the act by Flash, while both closely regarded Herman. `Who is he, Wild?' asked Flash, a short, fat young man of five or six and twenty, dressed in a torn bottle-green coat worse for wear; a soiled claret-velvet waistcoat, and buff cassimere pants much too tight for his legs, and a threadbare greasy blue broadcloth cap, jauntily worn to one side, with a faded gold tassel dangling over his left ear. `Aye, who is he, Wilks? I'm blowed if I knows him!' repeated the other gentleman, shutting up his left eye, and eyeing Herman inquisitively with the right. This interrogator was endowed with a bright red complexion, sandy hair, and two monstrous whiskered warts on his chin, which otherwise had no beard. His nose was half gone, a mouthful having been taken from its extremity by a bull-dog which had seized him by that member, as he was entering through a store window in the way of his profession, which was that of a burglar. Plymp, for that was the name of this personage, had also but a part of an ear, the residue having been left on a post, to which he was nailed in Virginia for slave-stealing, and from which durance he escaped minus the portion of cartilage in question. He was a savage-looking fellow, tall and ill-jointed, with a huge red freckled hand, that looked as if it could fell a horse with a single blow of it clenched. The attire of this ruffian consisted of a stout drab box-coat, cut very close in the skirts, and buttoned to his chin, the collar standing up above his ears; and a pair of blue check trowsers, rolled up over the top of thick-soled boots. A cap not unlike a fireman's, save that it wanted the capo, was lowered over his assassin-like eyes, and gave him at once a revolting and wicked aspect. `Come to Napes' room both of you, and I will tell you, boys,' answered Wild in a conciliating tone, speaking low `Depend upon it he is one of us, and you will find it for your interest to be friends with him. You have seen already he has the courage of an eagle, and that he would make a dangerous foe!' `Well, if you say so, Wilks, I am content! I can't go to Napes' room to-night, as Flash and I have a little fancy work cut out, and I was going to look after it when I saw this pretty wench, who has made such a muss, tripping by like a kitten going wisitin' of a Sunday afternoon. If she is his sister, then I'm sorry. So, comrade, give us your flipper!' he said, addressing Herman, who had all this time been soothing and encouraging his recovered treasure; for she seemed to him ready each moment to sink to the ground, being yet ignorant who her timely friend was, and fearing still that she was in the grasp of one from whom she had quite as much to fear as from the others; for, in the confused state of her faculties, she had been hardly conscious of what actually passed around her while Herman was rescuing her. `Revive, and speak for my sake, dearest Maria!' he said, with anxiety and deep tenderness, as he gazed upon her marble and still features. `It is Herman who speaks to you! Herman who holds you!' `I say, friend, give us your fives,' repeated Plymp, in a louder tone. `No harm meant, and none done, I hope!' `Stand back, fellow, and don't friend me!' cried Herman angrily. `When I cross hands with thee, it shall be as thy foe, and with a knife in them; for I mean yet to wipe out the insult you have put upon this fair girl, by laying your savage grasp upon her person! Away, I want nothing with you! Throw open the door some of you and give her air!' He was obeyed, and bearing his burden to the open passage, she felt the night-air upon her brow and lifted her eyelids. He bore her in his arms out of the sunken tap, and gained the side-walk with her. Flash and Plymp would have rushed after him, but Wild placed himself against the door which he had shut the instant Herman had got out. `This game won't do, master,' cried the burglar, with a terrific oath. `Give back and leave the way free, or I will pin you to the door as I would a beetle!' Wild fixed his eye steadily upon those of the burglar, and said with a firm voice, `Plymp, I do not fear your knife, so put it up. The young man who has gone out came in with me, and I will not suffer him to come to harm. If you want me to serve you again, or to be friends with me, you had best let this matter pass in a quiet way. It is true I am not your Captain as I once was; but you know that I am preparing to organise again, and that you are to be my `first.' So be peaceable. This stranger you will yet say is a trump!' `Who is he, then?' asked Plymp, sullenly. `Aye, who is the chap, Captain?' echoed Flash, in a swaggering way. `He is a lad who served his aprenticeship with me, and has to-night just got back from a long cruise in other lands. That girl is his sister,' added Wild, who, however, only guessed at this conjecture from Herman's manner towards her. He had seen her features, and was struck not only with their finished beauty, but also with a startling resemblance to somebody or other he had seen before; a resemblance that greatly perplexed him, and with which something or other was associated which he could not clearly and distinctly recal from the past. After a few more words interchanged aside between the two burglars and Wild, the former left the tap together, as they said, to proceed on a private burglarious expedition of their own; while the latter following them out, said he would go and see how his friend got home with his sister, and give him a helping hand if it were needed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. The meeting and interview. The night air served to revive the lovely girl whom Herman had so courageously rescued from the ruffians in the tap-room of the Saracen's Head; and after he had supported her a few steps along the side-walk with his arm around her, she stopped, and drawing back, said faintly, `Sir, you are very kind, but I can proceed alone. It is but a few steps. You are very good to do what you have for me.' `Maria, is it possible you do not know me,' exclaimed Herman with suspicion. `It is me —Herman.' `Then it was not a confused dream of my bewildered brain as I was in that horrible den. I thought I heard and knew your voice,' she cried with joy. `Herman it is you,' she added, looking up into his face as the street lamp fell upon it and revealed the look of tenderness and love with which his eyes were bent on her. And taking both his hands between hers she pressed them with the warmth of sisterly affection. `How happy you will make your mother.' `Is she well, Maria?' he asked eagerly. `Yes, and lives but a few steps off.' `I will hasten to see her. But how is it I found you there! How is it I have met you in this situation? Why is it you are in New York at all?' he asked with a tone of anxiety. `In a few words she told him the object of her errand and how she had been insulted and driven into the Saracen's Head for shelter and protection.' `Sad protection you were likely to find there,' he said as she ended. `Thank God I was near you to save you from these villains.' `I can never be too grateful to you Herman, she answered with warmth. `Come, here is the door.' `This? What a wretched abode! Is my mother so poor?' he exclaimed with pain as he surveyed the wretched exterior of the habitation. `Yes, Herman, she is very poor! But you shall know all when you have seen your mother. Let me go first in and break the news or her heart will break for joy on seeing you.' `That is right and prudent, just like yourself, dear Maria,' he said pressing a kiss upon her brow as they stood together in the doorway. She shrunk instinctively from him so that he could not but observe and speak of it: `You did not once shrink from my kiss, Maria?' `We were children then, Herman! But let us not quarrel now,' she said with a pleasant laugh. `I will run up and tell mother the good news.' `And I will go into the next shop and purchase some candles as you say there is no light up stairs.' `You are very kind, dear Herman,' she said as she tripped lightly up the dark stair way. `Dear Herman,' he sottly repeated to himself. `That little phrase makes all square again! I had began to fear she might have found somebody during my absence she loved quite as well as Herman! Her refusing a kiss was only maiden coyness; and as she says, she is not a child now, she is a lovely girl indeed! She has grown taller and fairer! I begin to think she is too far above me she looks so lovely and pure and good.' Thus reflecting within himself he went and purchased the candles, and having lighted one he returned to the door where he found Maria waiting for him. `Have you broken it to her?' he asked eagerly. `Yes; gently as I could.' `And where is she?' `On her knees in prayer waiting for you.' Herman felt his bosom glow with the fire of filial devotion and awe when he heard these words and reverently ascended the stairs preceded by Maria carrying the lighted candle. She opened the door and standing aside let him enter. Mrs. De Ruyter rose from her knees and unclasping her hands stood gazing an instant and then rushed towards him. `My son! my boy! my Herman.' `Mother, dear mother.' For a few moments mother and son stood locked in each others arms in silence, and both in tears, while Maria freely wept for joy. At length composure was restored to each and the three sat down, the mother by her long absent boy's side, his hand in hers her eyes on his, and the maiden upon a low stool a little removed from them, and gazing upon both with looks of equal affection. They listened to his brief account of his voyage home and his arrival that even ing in port and then how he happened to meet with Maria so singularly while he was searching for them without any clue to direct his steps. `But it was certainly very imprudent, dear mother, for you to let Maria go out at such an hour in a neighborhood like this.' `I would have gone, Herman dear, but she would not suffer me to.' `And I am used to being out after dark, Herman,' said the maiden smiling. `How and for what?' `Because Maria has a place, Herman, and she seldom leaves it till eight o'clock and sometimes stays later.' `A place! I don't understand you! But now I think again where I am and look at this wretched chamber I begin to comprehend! Is it possible Maria works out as a servant.' `Not that, oh no, Herman,' exclaimed his mother. `Then do explain one of you,' he cried impatiently, and looking from one to the other. `How is it you are in New York! How is it you are so poor—so utterly destitute! I learned something of this from Rolfe the Book-man!' `Rolfe the Book-man,' repeated Maria in a voice of surprise and a look of alarm, while her color fled. `Yes. He first told me that you were here, dear mother, in this city, though I could hardly believe it, and had seen you pass in the garb of poverty; and he also described a young girl who I know now was Maria.' Herman did not take notice of the effect his words in allusion to Rolfe had upon Maria, being too deeply interested to have an answer to his inquiries. `There is a long and sad story, Herman, my son! You must make up your mind to suffer a great disappointment.' `There is but one thing that can be a subject of disappointment to me in this life, mother,' he said bending his warm glance upon the maiden, who feeling it dropped her eyes and looked distressed. `Let your story be short and let me hear the worst. So it does not affect you and Maria I am careless of the consequences.' `Then know, Herman, that Mr. Waldeigh has proved unfaithful! He has failed and become bankrupt, and every dollar of your money with the income you reserved for my use is lost. It was this that led me to come to New York and which has reduced us to the indigence you find us in.' `Is this man living?' demanded Herman after a few moments severe thought; for the intelligence produced no other effect upon him than darkening his brow and compressing his lips. `Is this man—this Mr. Waldeigh, my trustee, living.' `Yes; and rumour says he is still rich. I have been several times to see him, but could never gain admittance. He did leave the city at one time, but returned again.' `Very well, dear mother, let him drop just now,' he said in a quiet manner. `Something must be done to make you and Maria more comfortable! This house will never do. Fortunately I have six hundred dollars of my own with me, and this is yours, mother? Tomorrow I will have you out of this hole!' `Now then, I will tell you, Herman and mother, also, what I have been doing,' said Maria with a brightening smile, and blushing at the reflection of her own good act, `I meant to surprise dear mother, but as you have come I may as well tell!' `Ah, something good I know that, my beloved child,' said Mrs. de Ruyter with kindly praise; `You are always trying to make me happy. Well, child, God will reward you! You will never suffer while you love so to provide for the happiness of those around you!' `You think too much of the little I can do for you, mother! I have received since my tenth year all I have had from you! I can repay you nothing in all that I can do. But I see brother Herman is impatient to know what great thing I have been doing!' `I am most impatient to know where you have a place, and why you have got one!' answered Herman. `You shall soon hear! What I have been doing is to hire two pleasant rooms in Nassau street with my wages, which I have furnished neat and comfortably, and got every thing ready for dear mother to go with them tomorrow!' `There, Herman!' cried Mrs. de Ruyter with the deepest admiration and gratitude, looking first upon Herman and then upon our heroine, `that is Maria perfectly! You see from this what she is to me, and what she has been to me since you left! But for her life would been dreary. She has been an angel beneath my roof!' `You cannot say one word that will cause me to think more of Maria than I do now;' said Herman enthusiastically, and endeavoring to pour into her eyes the floods of affection (more than brotherly) that flowed from his heart to her own. But she reservedly cast down the lids, and with a deep blush, said, `Now, Herman, I will tell you about my place. I hope you will not blame me if you do not like it; but then—' `But then what, my daughter? Why do you begin with an apology? We should have perished, but that you took this place at the greatest sacrifice of feeling, from a sacred sense of duty.' `Let Maria speak, mother! My heart bleeds for the suffering that has driven either of you to any sacrifices.' `I will speak for her, Herman, for I can speak best of her good and noble conduct,' answered Madam de Ruyter. `We were so reduced, and I being sick, that I had no means except what Maria's needle earned; and soon the confinement affected her health; when she would either have had to give it up, or seek something else. Well, she saw a place advertised in a paper, and thinking, perhaps, she would just suit it, she applied, and engaged herself in it without my knowledge. She has been there now about three months and received good wages, and the people are respectable and kind to her. The only drawback is that it is very public, and she has to encounter the gaze of young men, and to stay out late, for she is wanted evenings as well as in the day. She doesn't, however, go till ten in the morning, and so she helps me much at home. You have seen already what she has done with her wages over what we don't need to consume.' `What place is this, mother? a milliner's?' `No, Herman!' `Why this hesitation? Is it a tailor's?' `No!' `I will tell you, brother,' said Maria calmly, seeing him surprised and impatient at the apparent reluctance of his mother to reveal the character of the situation she held. `I will tell you, Herman, and perhaps you may blame me, as a modest girl, for taking it; but I had no alternative, and you may be assured that in no instance have I been treated by any one who has entered the shop otherwise than with that respect modesty and a pure heart always command! The place I am in is a retail cigar-store!' `A retail cigar-store!' he repeated, starting from his chair. `Maria in a place like that!' `It is very respectable, Herman,' said his mother. `It is on Broadway, and only resorted to by the most genteel company!' `Worse and worse, worse and worse!' he repeated with an angry brow. `I don't know what else would not have been better!' `But how could it be helped?' said his mother sternly. `How could it be helped, when we were perishing for food?' `But consider, mother, this young pure girl! consider Maria so guileless, so beautiful placed in a situation surrounded with such great dangers. Consider the peril to her reputation! Were she fair as the lily, the breath of slander would blast her fair fame forever! Oh, Maria! would to God you had reflected, ere you had taken this step!' `But, Herman, there was no bread in the house—nay, no house to shelter us. You are unreasonable.' `Yes, yes, I know it. I know it, mother,' he said despondingly and sadly. `I know it. You were poor, and I your protector was away. I must blame only myself. But this is the last day she remains there!' he cried with determination. `Nay, dear Herman,' answered Maria mildly, and laying her soft hand gently upon his shoulder, for he had reseated himself, and sat with his forehead pressed upon his hand; `I have yet four days more to complete my first term of engagement, which was for three months. Then, if you desire it, prove but your wishes to me as those of a brother, then if you wish it I will leave. I should break my agreement and do Mr. A—an injury by not going tomorrow.' `Well, tomorrow and the other three days, and then no longer,' he said, taking her hand in his. `You have no idea, Maria, how dear you are to me, and how fondly I have cherished your image in my heart. The idea of your being exposed to slanderers, surmises, and the rude impertinence of fashionable fops, almost makes me mad. But I know you have conducted yourself like yourself, and as I would wish to have you under such trying circumstances. But in a few days it will be past. Pardon my quickness. Instead of censuring you, I ought to kneel to you for your goodness to my mother. I ought to kneel to you as the preserver of her life!' `Nay, Herman, your feelings with reference to the exposed situation I hold are natural. Any brother, and are you not my brother! would feel as you do on making the discovery. I have had much to try me there; but the consciousness that I was serving her who had been as a mother to me, kept me from yielding to the tears that a hundred times a day gushed upwards to my eyes!' `Then you have often been insulted, or your feelings have been wounded. They must have been, though you have said to the contrary. I wish I knew of one who had dared to—' `Herman, be calm!' said Mrs. de Ruyter in a kind tone. `I know that you have no reason to be suspicious in this way. Who, seeing Maria's pure face, and looking into her heavenly blue eyes, where modesty and virtue dwell as if in their own home, would presume to insult her?' `I know it, mother; but there are brutes!' answered Herman, in a deep tone. `But let this pass. We will have all things smooth again soon. In four days more—nay, perhaps, tomorrow, for I can buy off your time, Maria, I dare say.' `I would rather remain till it is out,' said Maria. `Mr. A—has been very good to me, and I ought to give him time to get some person to supply my place.' `You are right, Maria, I dare say. Then let things remain as they are. Tomorrow I will assist mother to move into your nice rooms. I can go for you at night to come home with you. You have not come alone, and into such a quarter as this, I hope?' `No, sometimes Mr. A—came with me, and sometimes—sometimes—' here Maria hesitated, and then added, `a friend walks with me to the door.' He loved Maria with the deepest passion. Herman was of a quick, jealous temperament. He did not like the word `friend,' and was about to put some searching inquiry to her touching her friends, when a low tap was given upon the window; for, although the room was in the second story of the house, the street had been so raised that one passing on the walk, could with ease rap upon the window-panes with a stick. It was in this way the knock was given. `Who can that he?' said Herman rising, and looking out. By the faint glimmer of a street lamp in the next corner, he recognised the figure of Wilkins Wild who had followed him from the Saracen's Head Wild beckored to him on seeing him. `Excuse me, I will return in a moment,' he said, and went down to meet him. `Ah, me! How that secret knocking outside reminds me of old times when Herman was at home,' sighed Mrs. de Ruyter. `I trust he has not already fallen in with any of his old associates. Ah, Maria, I look only to you to save him from temptation! You heard now he said he had never ceased thinking of you, and how your image was graven on his heart, and how the thought of you kept him from wickedness when he was tempted to it! I am so happy to see that he loves you so. This love for you will be his salvation! All I wish is to see you married and happy before I am removed! Did you see how calmly he took the loss of his money, when I thought he would rave and storm; and then how beautifully he said, only one thing would disappoint or make him unhappy; and, while he spoke, he fixed his eyes on you full of hope and love. I am glad you both love each other, and that you will, for your own sake too, try to keep him from temptation now he is back again.' `I love Herman as a brother, dear mother!' said Maria, evidently pained at the words of Madame de Ruyter, and looking distressed. `I trust he only regards me as a sister.' `Yes, as a sister, dear, and also as a wife!' `I can never love Herman other than as a sister loves a brother, dearest mother!' said the maiden firmly, but very pale. `If I thought he regarded me with any tenderer emotions than should find a place in a brother's bosom, I should feel unhappy. But, alas! I fear he does, and that I shall find unhappiness and sorrow follow from his error!' `But Herman looks upon you only as his future wife, dear Maria! He loves you devotedly. He believes you love him!' `Then he must be deceived, mother,' answered she, with calmness and decision. `Never breathe it to him, never! If your feelings are such, never let Herman know them, child! It would be terrible! I don't know what he might not do! The idea that you love him is all that, with his fierce and intractable nature, that keeps him under any restraint. But for this belief, I have no doubt he would have become a pirate in distant seas! but for it to cheer him now, he will be a desperate man! To hear you say what you have said makes my heart bleed, and wrecks all my hopes! But, perhaps, you will feel differently by and by!' `Never, dear mother! I love Herman as a brother! I am grateful to him for his kindness and attachment to me. But I can only return him a sister's affection!' `Then, if you love me, child, keep Herman ignorant of this. To know it would drive him to some desperate act! But have you not another in your heart, Maria?' she asked, with sudden questioning of the lovely and embarrassed girl. She was about to make some confused reply, when Herman entered and said he had to go away on some business, and as he could not be lodged there, he would return and see them early in the morning. He then hurriedly departed, and the next moment the steps of two men were heard moving up the street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. The Highwayman. The person who had knocked upon the window, to draw the attention of Herman, was Wilkins Wild. When Herman went down to him he was standing upon the side-walk, close by the door. `Herman,' said he in an eager tone, `you say you would like to see your father? He has just gone by towards the Saracen. He was hurrying so that he did not see me. If you come with me I can show him to you, and introduce you as my friend Corney!— He will be in his room, for that is his strong hold.' `Thank you, Wilkins. I wish of all things to meet my father;' answered Herman with deep emotion. `I will just go in and tell my mother and sister good night!' “Then that was your sister and your mother who lives here!' observed Wild, after Herman had gone up stairs and returned and taken his arm. `Yes, I found her through my sister whom I met so strangely!' `Then that was your sister. Do you know I think I have seen her before, and under circumstances that made a deep impression upon me! Yet it could not be her, but somebody very like! Whether it was, in truth, a person or a picture, I am not certain; but the face haunts me!' At his first speaking Herman thought he might have seen her in a cigar-store, but when he mentioned a picture, his heart leap-to his mouth; for he recollected that Wilkins' account of the picture of the lovely child he had seen at Mr. Carroll's, first led him to be himself interested in her. And he trembled at the thought that he might, by some accident, make his memory perfect, and fully identify Maria as the original of the picture, and, of course, as the young girl who had so mysteriously disappeared at the time of Shears' murder, and whom Wild had hinted might have been, possibly, its perpetrator! To prevent him from dwelling upon this dangerous subject, which, if pursued and Maria identified by him, would place her wholly in Wild's power, if he chose to use his information, Herman said quietly: `How did my father look? Was he well clad?' `He looked pretty hard used, my boy! But you will see him for yourself. Here we are at the Saracen! Come in! Not that door; but by this private entrance down through the cellar! He always goes strait to his room first, and then if he finds the tap is clear he goes down. Take care of your head as it is low, and lay your hand upon my shoulder, as it is as dark as a dungeon! There we are into the light again in the court! Now mount these stairs and step carefully, for they are ricketty. It is the third door along the plat-form!' `Whose room?' `Your father's!' Here Wild struck upon a door twice heavily. `Who is it?' demanded a deep voice within. `The Captain!' `Aye, aye! come in,' answered the voice; and the sound of a bar removed from the door was heard, and the door cautiously opened a little ways and the occupant peeped out. `Two of you!' he said in a surprised tone, pressing the door closer! `Who is the other?' `A friend! Corney. You have heard me speak of him!' `Yes, yes. Come in both of you.' And opening the door he let them in, and carefully closed and barred it after them. `You are cautious to night, Ruyter!' said Wild in a careless tone. `I have been at work and made a miss of it, and the hounds are abroad!' `Ah, that is bad! But you are safe enough here! What have you been doing?' `I bade a gentleman stand at the corner of Barclay street, and he gave me his purse with one hand, knocked me down with the other, and sung out for the Watch. But I got to my feet and rolled two of the Charlies into the gutter, and so got clear!' `With the purse?' `Yes! Here it is!' he answered jingling in his hand a handsome scarlet silk purse.— There is in all thirty dollars in it!' While he was talking Herman was silently regarding his father's features. He was seat ed by a rude table on which burned a tallow candle in a wooden socket. The light struck upwards against his features and gave to them a sharp sinister cast that was revolting. Yet he could trace in that dark countenance, disfigured by uncontrolled evil passions, remains of manly dignity and beauty. He was a man about five and forty, heavily framed, and wearing long grey or black hair flowing upon his shoulders. His eye brows were thick and bushy black, and beneath them glowed dark eyes of the most viciously hardened expression. Crime and years of imprisonment, during which he brooded over revenge, had made the man a demon. Sweet humanity with all her gentle train seemed banished from his lineaments. He wore a shaggy green box coat and a red woollen sash was wound about his neck without a collar. Upon the table by him was a short club, a pistol, and an old glazed leather cap, a pair of soiled thick deer-skin gloves lay by the cap and upon one of them were stains like blood. See illustration, page 1. Herman silently saw all this and then glanced his eye around the narrow apartment occupied by his father. It contained a rude double cot-bed, three chairs, a chest and table, all of the meanest description. There were two square windows in the room, one looking towards the street, the other into the court yard. Each window contained but eight small panes of glass, and was heavily barred with oaken beams let into sockets. There were two heavy bars also for the door, one of which was now only in its place, the other standing by its side. `Do you know this man, Ruyter?' `No. I saw him coming out of the Astor House and as he looked like a gentleman and a foreigner I thought I would make a lift by following him!' `Here is a name on the silver clasp,' said Wild taking the purse. `It is Delorme! He was an Englishman, for this is an English name and a good family too!' `Then he ought to have had more money about him,' said the foot-pad growling. `I will do better next time!' `Your way of raising a revenue upon the sovereign people, isn't so safe as mine,' said Wild laughing. `You had best give up the high ways and take to picking locks.' `That is beneath me,' answered Ruyter.— `If I have been in States' prison, I am at least a gentleman in blood.' `Every man to his taste. Now here is Corney here, a man I dare say of as good blood as you are, Ruyter, who has not disdained to play the clasher on one occasion.' Here Ruyter directed his gaze inquisitively towards Herman whose sensations at such a moment it would be difficult to describe. He had seen his father only to despise him; and as he sat before him he internally resolved that he would never acknowledge him or be made known to him. As his father kept his gaze upon him Herman dropped his eyes and tried to assume an indifference that he was very far from feeling. He trembled each instant lest by some means he should be recognized by him. But his father after regarding him steadily for a few moments looked away with this remark, `Your friend is young, Wild, and may do better by and by than pick locks. If he will come under my teaching I will made a gentleman of him in my way!' `I dare say he is very much obliged to you. But by the by, have you found your wite yet?' `No,' answered Ruyter with a deep oath. `I am persuaded she is in the city, for I have found out that much. But where she conceals herself, I can't yet find out!' `What do you want to see her for? You knew she is nothing to you now! State's prison divorces!' `I know that! But I mean to see the woman! I know her well, and that I can intimidate her to give me a home and money, too, if I am short run!' `What money has she?' carelessly wishing to get all he could out of his friend. `None of her own I reckon, for the person who saw her said she was poor-looking! But she has the control of my boys's twenty thousand, and it is to get the possession of this I would see her. This one idea has been uppermost in my mind ever since I first entered Sing-Sing.' `Ah, yes! you had a son, I now remember!' `Yes; a fine little fellow when I saw him last—a boy of some six or seven years! And he is living now if he hasn't been shipwrecked; for I have heard he has grown up a fine looking man and gone to sea. This money was given him by his mother after she sold her old rookery and the land, and it is in trust now with somebody; but who I can't find out!— Now if I can fall in with her I can get it all out of her before he returns from sea; and once in my possession, he may whistle for it! If he or she are troublesome, I have a settler here!' And he laid his hand significantly upon his knife. Wild looked aside at Herman's face, which he saw was deadly pale, while his eye was fearfully black, save a bright, intense star of indignant light, blazing in the depth of its centre. He was about to make some remark to Ruyter, but the expression of Herman's face checked his words. He saw that he was about to speak, and he resolved to wait the result. `Sir,' said Herman, with fearful calmness, and bending his eyes upon him, while he smiled with an appalling aspect, `what would you give to him who told you where you could find Madame de Ruyter?' `What would I give?' cried he eagerly, and leaning earnestly forward upon the table; I would give him one hundred dollars, so that he did it!' `What security have I, if I give you this information, that you will pay me?' `My word! Do you doubt it?' `No. I will take your word. Come with me and I will take you to her abode!' `You will! Do you know it?' `Yes. I have been there this very night and seen her!' `You are my man!' cried Ruyter rising up placing his cap on his head. `The only condition I require is, that you go with me unarmed! Leave your weapons here!' `A trap!' `Do you fear? Then I am not bound to show you!' answered Herman with a smile of contempt. `Then I will go without my weapons. I can trust him—can I?' he asked in an under tone of Wild. `Yes, by all means! He is trump!' Then puzzled at Herman's course, he, in his turn, asked the latter in an under tone, `what in the deuce he intended to do with the hoary old villain?' `Leave him to me,' answered Herman, `and keep my secret!' `I will!' `Are you ready?' said Herman in a commanding tone as he rose and approached the door, the bar across which he took down with his own hand. `Yes, quite. But —' `But what? Why do you hesitate?' `I'm blamed if I like your looks, and suspect a trap. If Wild was not here I should believe you were an officer?' `Then I will go without you. Come, Wilkins, we will depart!' `Nay, then, here goes with you, Mr. Corney!' answered his father, who by no means relished the singular tone and air of the young stranger; and, under other circumstances, his aroused suspicions would have deterred him from committing himself to his guidance; but his strong desire to see his former wife, for whom he had been diligently on the look-out since he had been out of prison, led him to overcome his suspicious fears of a plan to arrest him, and to accompany the young man on the expedition before him. He therefore followed him to the street, and here Herman, after saying a few words to Wild, who left and entered the tap of the Saracen's Head, took the direction towards his mother's abode, his father walking by his side with the silent, watchful air and manner of a man who expects each moment to be betrayed. `Herman has taken a strange way of acting,' said Wild as he entered the tap, after looking down the street until they disappeared; `he says it is all right, and bids me wait for him in the little room where the good dame Dirk is to have his supper ready. Well, Herman is a devil of a fellow! The old man has got into a scrape now, I will wager! It was capital that he should have divulged his whole plan right before Herman! If he knew how I cheated him, passing his son off for Corney, he'd put a knife into me! So, I only pray Herman may keep him safe, whatever he is going to do with the old rogue!' When Herman reached the door leading up the narrow and dark stair-way leading to his mothers' room, he turned and addressed his father in these terms. `The woman you seek lives here. I will go up first and prepare her for such an unlooked for visitor. You say you were once her husband, and the sudden sight of you might affect her! Remain you here, while I go up. But come into the entry and let me close the door. Ruyter obeyed though not without hesitation; and when he saw the door shut upon him he felt a little trepidation; and after he saw Herman turn the key and place it in his pocket, he became satisfied that he had been trapped. He was about to spring upon the young man and seize him by the throat, charging him with treachery, but Herman had already ascended the stairs and opened the door at the top of the flight and entered the room. `This place looks confoundedly suspicious, and I don't by any means like this young fellow's looks. He eyes me with an evil eye, and means me no good! But perhaps he is right in saying the woman lives here, and means honestly. I will wait and see what comes of it. I don't like his locking me in here in this fashion. Let me see if one of these panels is not loose! I would get out if I could. Yes, the door is old and one gives way! The fresh air enters! I'm out of my trap!' He was about to yield to his fear and escape, when he heard the sound of a female voice above stairs, which at once arrested him! `Yes, that is madam! The young fellow is right! I would know that voice in Patagonia!' he exclaimed with satisfaction, and hurriedly replacing the panel, he eagerly half ascended the stairway. All was the next moment still. He listened with the most intense attention. `Mother,' Herman said on entering suddenly, as he did just as she about retiring for the night, `mother, I have news of a painful nature to communicate. My father is pardoned out of prison!' `I knew it, Herman, and have trembled lest he should seek me!' answered his mother with alarm visible on her countenance and taking him by the hand with fear. Maria was not visible, but a slight motion of the curtain that concealed the bed, and a look which Mrs. de Ruyter cast that way showed him that she had already retired, fatigued with the duties and events of the day. `He does seek you! Nay—hear me with firmness. `I have met him, but he knew me not, knows me not! I was introduced to him under the name of Corney. Such you must call me before him, for you will see him in a few moments!' `See him! Oh, Herman, Herman, have you brought your father hither?' she cried, clasping her hands. `Yes, mother! I did it from a laid plan. I heard him say to a friend and to myself, supposing me to be Corney, that he sought you to get my property from you (knowing me, as he said, to be at sea) and to get a home and asylum with you by intimidating you. He said he would give a hundred dollars to any one to show him where you were. A scheme entered my mind suddenly, and I said that I would show him, for I knew where you lived. He is now below in the entry! When you see him meet him carelessly, and firmly, for I shall be present. Be guided by me in the progress of the interview; for this night I mean to relieve you from all future fears from him. I have thought it best if he was resolved to see you, he had best see you once for all in my presence. Now be calm, and I will bring hin in! Be firm, dear mother, for I am with you, and remember!' Mrs. de Ruyter stood pale and confounded, with her hands clasped upon her bosom, and her eyes lifted to Heaven in prayer for strength. Herman tenderly embraced her, repeated his injunctions to be firm, and then went towards the door. `Come up, sir, the lady will see you,' said Herman, opening the door and calling below. When Ruyter entered and beheld his wife standing, calm and self-possessed, though very pale, in the centre of the room, he remained a moment gazing upon her without motion. Her matronly air and lady-like dignity, abashed him, and made him feel the inferiority to which crime had degraded himself. Herman advanced a few steps, and stood not far from his mother, giving her a look of encouragement. But how could the poor lady gather encouragement from such a source, against such a danger! How could she gather strength from the assurance that the son would protect the mother against the father! Her heart sunk within her; though she strove to sustain herself, feeling that she had need! At length the returned convict spoke: `So,' he said, with a half smile, that on his features was a leer of the grossest hardihood of character, `so wife we have met again!' `I am no longer your wife, sir,' she answered firmly. `That is as we may agree, madam, he answered with irony, and advancing a step nearer to her. `I say young fellow,' he added, turning to Herman, here is the purse I took, you know when! Take it in part pay and go. To-morrow I will pay you the balance of what I agreed to!' As he spoke he tossed the purse to Herman. Take it and go back to the Saracen! I have some little private affairs with this lady to talk over!' `I keep the purse but shall not leave until I receive the balance,' answered Herman, placing the purse in his pocket. `There are thirty dollars in it,' answered the convict with a savage glance!' `There should be seventy more. Till I receive it I shall not leave you,' answered Her man with positiveness. `Say what you say before me if you cannot pay me what you owe!' `Then go to the devil for the balance,' answered Ruyter with a brutal oath. `Listen if you will, I care not!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. The Conviction. When the convict had thus spoken he turned to Madame de Ruyter, who, pale and trembling had listened to their words, and said to her. `Madam, I should judge you were not very glad to see me by your looks, but I am determined to make my home here! What has become of Herman's money?' `It is all lost!' she answered faintly. `Lost? I do not believe a word of it! How lost?' `The banker who had it in trust failed?' `'Tis false! who was he?' he cried advancing, and was about to lay his hand upon her; but Herman's arm intervened and knocked his upward, while he said to him in a very positive tone, `Speak to the lady, and lay not a finger upon her!' `Ah, younker, you are home here it seems! what is the woman to you! She is my wife, and I'll thank you to keep yourself at a distanced!' `Who I am, you shall know in good time. I shall see the lady is not rudely treated. What you have to say, say to her, for the hour is late!' His father fixed on him a glance of rage and hatred, but seeing the tall well-limbed young man stand composed and resolute, he feared the encounter with him, he meditated; and then he remembered that he was without his weapons. `Well, I'll find time and a way to be quits with you, young fellow,' he said sullenly. `Now, wife, let us hear about the money you put in bank for your son!' `I have told you it was all gone! The banker has failed and both Herman and I are impoverished You see my abode. This should convince you!' The convict glanced his eyes around the wretched abode, and then said— `Very well, it may be so, but I doubt it.— Who was this banker?' `Mr. Waldeigh!' `Oh, aye! I remember his name. I can find out the truth of this matter for myself then to-morrow. Where's Herman?' `He, he went to sea two years ago,' answered his mother catching Herman's cautioning glance. `Yes, so I heard! When do you look for him home?' `He wrote me he should be here about this time!' `Well, I'm glad he will find his money all gone,' said Ruyter with an oath; `he is a confounded high spirited fellow I'm told, and don't fear the devil! I hope he'll come soon, for when he finds he's poor he'll take easily to training for the profession I follow; and I'd like to have the teaching of the boy. If he's so smart as I hear he is, he'll cut me all out! Now, old woman what have you got for supper?' `Nothing!' `Nothing—I must have something. I havn't eaten since my dinner, and that was a slim affair. You may as well stir for I mean to sup and lodge here to-night!' As he spoke he was about to sit down in a chair, when Herman removing it from behind him cast it to the farther side of the room, saying at the same time, `Now, sir, if you have said all you wish to this noble and virtuous lady whom you have so long disgraced by your crimes, it is time you should take your leave, for be assured here this night you neither sup nor lodge!' `Who the devil are you?' asked de Ruyter after gazing with surprise upon him as he stood eyeing him with calm and resolute eyes. `I am the bearer of the name you have disgraced and degraded! I am the inheritor of your infamy. My name is Herman de Ruyter like thine own!' `What?' exclaimed the astonished father starting back and fixing his confounded stare upon the features of his son. `Are you Herman? Are you my son?' and he trembled with fear as he put the interrogation to the indignant and stern young man. `To my disgrace I am thy son, man of crime! In me behold the child for whom it was your duty to have lived an honorable and virtuous life! But instead you turned your red hand to guilt, and brought woe upon your wife, my mother, and entailed dishonor upon me! For this I might forgive you, but for your wrongs to her I love and honor, I curse you! Vile wretch! not satisfied with the deep wrongs you have done her, you would now come crawling like the slimy serpent from your filthy den of crime, and coiling yourself upon her threshhold, poison all the air around you! No!—I am here to be her protector, and, if need be, her avenger! To me you are only a convict of the State's prison! As a father I never knew you or your love! I have only known my mother.— Therefore beware my vengeance, for no filial emotion lies between it and thee! That thou mightest hear me speak, and that I might know all thy purpose towards my mother, I brought thee here myself, lest you should creep hither unawares and do mischief! I thought it best you should see her in my presence. You have seen her, and in the interview betrayed to us both the deep depravity of your base heart. Now, sir. the interview is ended! From this moment be a stranger to this lady! See her house again, dare to lift a recognising look in the street, dare to approach her in any way, and I swear to you by the God that made me, that that hour shall be your last!' `Herman, Herman!' cried Mrs. de Ruyter in the deepest anguish, `Not one word to me, dear mother, now.— Come, sir, take up your cap and leave this place, and never cross its threshold again! I shall watch your movements from this time with a jealous eye. Leave the house, wretched and guilty man! Seek your den and never crawl from it again to meet the eyes of the wife and son you have so deeply wronged!” Thus speaking Herman opened the door.— Abashed, humbled and subdued by fear, the guilty wretch turned and silently left the chamber and descended the stairs. He spake not a word, nor even looked again upon the face of her who had once been his wife; but with his cap over his eyes and a shuffling, crouching air he went out of the room. What was in his heart will be better known in the progress of the tale. Herman went before him to unlock the outer door. His father passed out into the open air. Neither of them spoke. Herman locked the door after him and then rejoined his mother, whom he found fainting upon the floor, with Maria in her night-dress bending over her. In a few minutes their united efforts restor ed her, and after a while Herman took his leave promising to breakfast with them in the morning. On his way up the street, he reflected upon the course he had pursued with reference to his father, and felt satisfied that he had taken the only one which would effectually protect his mother from his persecutions. This subject was succeeded in his thoughts by the lovely image of Maria. He thought he had never seen her so beautiful as when bending over her mother in her snowy night-dress, her oval face looking sweetly and gently forth from her narrow bordered cap. But there was something in her look and manner that troubled him. They were kind, frank, sisterly; yet there was something wanting; semething in her glance to answer to his own deep loving one. She met his eye too freely, too unreservedly, too openly. It was not that timid, faltering glance which he looked for, and which he felt she would manifest if she thought of him with a tenderer love than a sister's. Herman was troubled as he thought, and vague surmises began to fill his bosom, that possibly Maria never thought of him with the same feelings with which he regarded her. `Still,' said he impetuously within himself, `still if she loves not me who else does she love! Certainly, knowing I am not her brother, she would never drive my image from her breast to replace it by another! Yet I must confess I tremble lest it should be so!' At this stage of his reflection he reached the door of the Saracen Head and entered.— The tap was nearly deserted; but two or three persons who were strangers drinking together at a table near the fire-place. Dirk Dilley was seated in her bar reading a newspaper.— Her toilet was improved by a coquettish cap worn upon the back of her head, and by fresh curls on either check. She looked up on seeing Herman enter as if expecting him, and smiled. `Ah,' said she with a smile, `so truant you come back! I was getting jealous of that pretty girl till I knew who she was! I heard all about your affair from Wilk'. So you've found your mother and sister! Well, I am glad of it, for you can let me have some of your company now! I was afraid they would keep you; but Wilk' told me you'd soon be in. Your supper is all ready in the little back parlor, and let us go in to the table; for it is going on to twelve o'clock. It isn't every body I'd keep up so late for, Herman!' `You are very good, Mrs. Wild—that is, Mrs. Dilley!' `Call me Isabel, as you did at first! Here is the door through the bar. Betty stay in the bar till those men have done drinking what they have, and thou shut up!' Thus giving her orders, the handsome young hostess of Saracen's Head preceded her guest into her tea-room in the rear of the bar. `Where is Wilkins?' asked Herman, looking round. `He is coming; for, as he begged hard, I invited him to supper with us! Wilk' is a good fellow, keep him under proper government. It's the way I began with him at first, when he came out of Sing Sing. If I had'nt been firm as I was, he would have come into my house and taken the helm!' `As my father would have done. I have seen him, but we met and parted as enemies!' `Well you have a great deal to forgive, Herman, if you forgive him at all,' said Dame Dilley, placing the hot-water pot upon the waiter. `Ah, here is Wilk' all in good time,' she said, as she heard the tap door open. `I knew his step! But it sounds as if he was in bad humor!' The next moment the door into the tearoom from the bar opened, and Wild entered. He smiled slightly, and expressed, in a brief word or two, his gratification at finding Herman there; and throwing aside his hat and coat, he took a seat by the table at which Herman had just placed himself. Wild's countenance worked dark and gloomy, and he seemed to find it difficult to enter into the conversation as the supper progressed. `What the deuce is the matter, Wilkins?' asked dame Dilley, after looking at him steadily. `Well the truth is, I have met your father, Herman, and he assures me that your property is all gone by the board!' `So it is. Waldeigh has become bankrupt!' `You take it very coolly!' `It would seem more coolly than you yourself, Wild!' `I — that is I feel confounded sorry for you!' answered Wild, embarrassed; for the news he had heard from Ruyter had dashed his hopes to the ground of sharing the twenty thousand dollars with Dirk Dilley. Her countenance immediately fell; but she had full command over its expression. `Is it true, Herman?' she asked. `So my mother tells me. I am sorry rather on her account, than my own. But I have a few hundred left.' `Have you seen this Waldeigh?' `No! But he is in the city!' `I dont believe all is lost, Herman! I know a way by which he can be compelled to disgorge; for this same Waldeigh lives now in good style in the upper part of Broadway!' `In what way?' `I cannot now explain. But if you will promise to give me one quarter I get out of him, I will undertake it!' `I will do it,' answered Herman. `The matter is then settled,' answered Wild with a cheerful tone. By and by Herman left the table, and was shown to his room by Dame Dilley, who bade him good night, but less frankly than she would have done had he been worth the twenty thousand dollars she was fishing for. She closed the door and then returned quickly, and with an anxious look to the tea-room, where she had left Wild. On entering it she closed the door carefully, and sitting down fixed her eyes upon his face. `Well, this game is up,' she said gloomily. `No, Isabel,' answered the burglar-captain. `I want to hear your plans?' `And share in the spoils?' `I do. Mr. Waldeigh, who was the trustee of this money failed, it is true. But he now lives in good style, and must have money. I have no doubt that every dollar of Herman's money is safe in his hands!' `How will you get it, if it is?' `By my genius,' Bel! I shall go the first thing to-morrow and sound the premises. I will have Waldeigh in my power in less than twenty-four hours. You know I have four good men I can trust. I shall want the `Black Hole.' `Ah, I see your plan. You are like yourself again, Wild! The spirits of old times has come over you! Now I will tell you what I will do If this Waldeigh has the money and you get it out of him, I will promise, if you pay down half of it to me, to marry you! `If I had half of it, I should choose a wife where I liked best, Bel! But dont look dark Let us be friends. I can't let you have half, as I claim only a quarter of what I may get Herman must have the balance!' The widow reflected a few moments, and then said, as if yielding, `Well, Wild, as you say. Go to work and when you have got the money we can talk about its division! Now to your room, for its after midnight. To-morrow night let me know what you have done. The burglar captain then took his leave after taking a glass of brandy, which she offered him. She let him out by a door into the court, for his room was on the same gallery with that occupied by Napes and Ruyter. Seeing a light glimmering beneath the door of their apartment, he knocked and giving his name to Ruyter was admitted, and the door closed upon him. In about twenty minutes he came forth again, having detailed to both his plan, with reference to Mr. Waldeigh, and secured their aid; of Ruyter he was sure of from the first, for he had learned the result of the meeting between Ruyter and Herman, from the lips of the former, when he saw him outside the Saracen's Head on his return from Madame de Ruyter's, though the convict did not give him the account until he had first cursed him for having introduced his son to him under the name of Corney. As Wild was taking his departure from their chamber, after his secret interview with the two, Ruyter said softly, so that Napes did not hear, `Does Herman lodge here to-night?' `Yes.' `Is he in bed?' `Yes.' `In what room!' `Ah, do you mean him harm?' asked Wild, quickly. `No, by my soul. He is my boy. Only I wished to know. `He is in the first room on the lower floor!' `Thank you! I dont mean him harm! good night.' Ruyter closed the door and waited till all was still, and then taking his knife and pistol up from the table, he wrapped his over-coat around his shoulders and was going out, when Napes, who had thrown himself upon the bed, asked him where he was going so late?' `A little private expedition of my own!' he answered with a scowl. `Well, don't disturb me when you come in!' said Napes turning over sulkily with his face against the wall. The gray-bearded convict closed the door noiselessly behind him, and descending the stairs to the court-yard stood a moment to listen. Finding all still he crossed it to the room which Herman occupied. He came to the door and looking through the key-hole saw that all was dark. He is safe there for to-night at least. Now for my revenge on her!' He turned quickly away and with a rapid step proceeded to a sort of court-gate which opened into a narrow alley. This being locked on the inner side he easily opened and passing forth into the alley, he was soon in the street in front of the tavern. He now took his way with a stealthy air towards the abode of Madame de Ruyter. As he came to it he paused beneath the window and listened. All was still. He placed his hand upon the door and found it fast. `I know as good a way,' he said stooping down and slipping aside the pannel which he had loosened two hours before on being left in the entry by Herman Looking carefully round to see that he was not watched he pushed his body through the opening, and disappeared within.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. The Consul's Ball. Leaving the convict Ruyter to proceed on his secret midnight expedition, we will now refer to an event of our story which has only yet been hinted at in connection with the little affair of the `Forget-me-not' worn by Maria in her bosom. The history of that little flower is the history of a pure and deep love. We have said that Maria's extreme beauty and her propriety in the exposed situation she had taken in the cigar mart, attracted many admirers. Some of these were young men of respectability, who, while they admired her beauty, greatly respected her virtue and modesty. Yet she manifested to one and all the same graceful propriety, in no instance overstepping the limits of the most perfect propriety. But the maiden's heart was not made of ice. The bulwark of reserve and insensibility which she had from the first thrown around her, was not strong enough to keep out the little god Love, who laughs at bars and barriers. There happened two gentlemen, an elderly man and a younger one to pass along Broadway one evening as she was standing in her place behind the counter.— Maria never looked lovlier than she did that evening. The light of the gas burner fell brilliantly upon her face, and softened, while it enriched its charms. The young man caught sight of the beautiful girl and arresting the progress of the elder gentleman, turned with him into the shop. With eyes fixed upon her in the deepest admiration the young man, who with his companion were evidently high-bred English people, asked her for cigars. While with a gracious smile and a grace that was inimitable she presented to him the small rose-wood boxes containing the most fragrant ones, he could not keep his eyes from her. At length their deep, passionate gaze was felt by her and with a blush of confusion she dropped her eyes to the ground, and while he remained did not once direct them towards him. `My lord, did you notice the extreme beauty of that lovely cigar-girl!' asked the young man with admiration in his tones, as they left the mart and resumed their walk. `Yes. She was remarkably lovely; and somehow her face has awakened in me a strange interest.' `Ah, my lord!' cried the young man coloring; `do you confess this much. I myself was about confessing that I had felt something of the same myself! We must be rivals!' `Your interest is widely different from mine my young friend; I felt a sad and gentle interest awakened in my bosom as I gazed on her. I thought, too, how many temptations so young a girl must be exposed, and—' `No doubt felt very philosophical and parental my lord,' answered the young man laughing. The interest which he felt in the lovely cigar-vender was not wholly upon one side.— She had met and felt the passionate yet respectful ardor of his glance, and it awakened in her bosom, emotions pleasing yet agitated. After his departure she did not forget him with the next customer, but the image of his fine face, for he was very handsome, and tall and noble in height and air, lingered in her thoughts and was carried home to her humble pillow where it mingled with her dreams. The first thought she had the next morning on awaking, was if she should see the noble young stranger again that day! and a hundred times her heart bounded as she lifted her eyes at an entering foot step which she thought sounded like his. Just at twilight she saw him slowly pass the door and look in. Her heart trembled with emotions of hope, fear and joy. He passed onward and disappeared, and she sighed and felt a pang of disappointment. The next moment she heard a step and looking up saw the subject of her thoughts entering the shop. She trembled like a leaf. She was afraid to look up, and stood covered with blushes which she tried to conceal, for she feared he would discover the interest he had awakened in her heart. She was alone in the shop. In the same breath she wished and did not wish the proprietors were present! With ease and self-possession he approached the glass case behind which she stood and in a tone that betrayed a feeling stronger than mere gallantry asked her for cigars. While she was waiting upon him he continued to regard her intently, and with increasing admiration. In a quiet conversational tone, and in a manner calculated to win her confidence (for he saw how embarrassed and confused she was) he began to speak with her. By degrees and in the most delicate way he succeeded in learning from her something of her history, that is so far as the poverty of her mother, as she called Mrs. de Ruyter, rendered it necessary for her to take such a place to aid in her support. He was charmed with the frank ingeunousness of her replies, and she with the kind interest he seemed to take in her. `I assure you, Miss,' he said to her `that the interest I have shown in these inquiries is sincere, and not mere curiosity. I have had you in my thoughts, nay, if I dared to speak it, in my heart, ever since I saw you yesterday. I resolved to visit you again and converse with you. You are very good to suffer me to talk with you. Do you live far from this?' `But ten minutes walk, sir,' she answered, dropping her eyes. `And do you walk alone?' `Not always, sir!' `Will you permit me to wait upon you this evening when you close your shop?' `Sir, you are very kind! but you will see the impropriety of my admitting it. I have only my fair name, which the least breath of slander will defame! The proprietor usually accompanies me; and sometimes I run all the way alone!' `I will not urge you,' he said pleasantly; `but I regret that you are compelled by circumstances, to be placed in such a situation. Will you permit me, as a friend, to take steps to render your mother's condition better, so that you can remain altogether with her?' `Indeed, sir, you are a stranger, though a kind one. I feel grateful for your proposal, but I must decline it!' At this moment some persons came in, and the young Englishman took his leave. An hour afterwards, as it was a moonlight night, Maria left the shop at eight o'clock to proceed homeward. She went tripping along with a rapid step and with a happy heart, for she was thinking of the young stranger, when suddenly she found a gentleman walking by her side, and his hand laid lightly upon her arm. `Do not be alarmed!' She knew the tones of the voice and restrained the impulse to fly; yet she trembled, though not with fear. `I have watched you that I may see you safely homeward,' said the foreigner in the gentlest cadence of his voice. `I thank you, sir, I am very grateful to you, but I had rather go alone!' `Then suffer me to walk a little ways behind you,' he said respectfully, and dropping back a step. She felt his consideration for her feelings, and instinctively yielding to the generous impulses which this conduct aroused in her bosom, she gradually walked slower, until he was again by her side. She felt a sweet sense of protection as he walked along by her, and her heart was filled with joy as he discoursed to her in the tender accents of a pure devotion. He accompanied her to the door, and there took leave of her, pressing the hand she diffidently yielded to his friendly parting clasp. `You will permit me this pleasure to-mor row night,' he said as he was leaving her. She would have said `yes,' if her feelings had governed; but, influenced by propriety, she answered faintly, `no.' `Then I must trust to chance,' he said, smiling. When she reached the room and was alone with her own thoughts, and began to examine the nature of her feelings towards the handsome and respectful young stranger, she confessed, with a sigh of sadness, that he was very dear to her—far dearer than she had ever felt Herman to be' `Yet he is a stranger! Why should I think of him. I may well sigh with sadness to think I have let my affections fix upon one who is evidently so far above me, and whose further acquaintance it would be wrong to encourage! I only know his name to be Edward, and that he is a native of England, but a few weeks in this city. I will try to think no more of him!' Yet the more she resolved to banish him from her thoughts, the more he filled them. The next evening the young stranger called at the shop for cigars; and although she tried to be reserved, his kindness and gentleness of manner rendered her resolutions of no avail. Taking advantage of a favorable moment he took from his breast a boquet, composed of a sprig of myrtle and a forget-me-not, and placed it in her hand. As he did so he smiled, bowed and took his leave. An hour afterwards when he overtook her going homeward and walked by her side, her arm placed with confidence in his, he was gratified to see that his light gift was in her bosom. After accompanying her to the door he proceeded towards the Astor House and entering, ascended to a suite of rooms where he found the gentleman Maria had first seen him with. This person was in full ball dress and was walking up and down the parlor, as if waiting for him. He was a noble looking man, with a decided military air and a commanding person. His age was probably fifty five or six. Upon a sofa, reading, sat a lady about five and forty, and retaining in her fine features traces of great beauty. There was in her face sufficient likeness to the young man to mark the near relationship of mother and son. `Ah, Edward, you have kept brother long waiting for you!' she said with a smile, mingled with her mild reproof. `Some more romancing I'll warrant,' answered the gentleman, smiling. `I shall have to leave New York to save you from falling in love with a pretty shop-tender!' `I confess to the charge, uncle, of having been detained by her. The truth is, my good lord, I fear I shall have to run away from her; for I was never so taken!' `You are imprudent, Edward,' said the lady Lessington. `You will do this young girl, it she is modest, a great injury and degrade yourself. I fear from the animated manner in which you yesterday gave me an account of your conversations with her and your boldness in escorting her homeward, that you have, in truth, suffered your feelings to get the better of your judgment. This conduct is so unlike you! Did I not know the integrity of your character I should fear that your regard for her was dictated by the worst motives!' `My dearest mother, I only wish you could see her, yourself. I know not what it is in her face that so deeply interests me. I frankly tell you, that it she were in a suitable rank in society, I should not hesitate to confess that I was deeply in love with her and seriously address myself to win her as my wife!' `Such being your feelings, my son, it is due to her as well as yourself that you do not see her again.' `I will not promise, my dear mother.' `Then we had best pursue our tour to Niagara and Montreal, brother,' she said turning to the gentleman who stood by in silence. `Yes, if Edward has so far forgotten himself and what is due to the honor of his rank and name.' `Nay, my lord and noble uncle, you are severe. I will make the promise to my mother; for I feel that it would be criminal and cruel in me to awaken feellngs in that young girls' bosom, which could only fall back again upon her own heart to perish! My mother is right. I will see her no more; for as an honorable man I cannot. But this decision will be a great sacrifice to me; for you know not how deeply my heart is interested in her, mother.' `Come, nephew, shall we go to this party. The carriage has been some time in waiting. I feared by your delay you had been attacked by some foot-pad, as I was early this evening. I gave him my purse to have time to knock him down, but the rogue got to his feet and escaped with it.' `I will complete my toilet in a few moments,' answered the young man. `I trust you were not hurt.' `No.' `I regret, mother, that your slight indisposition prevents you from going to this party,' added lord Edward; and he then left the room. After an absence of a few moments, he returned and announced himself as ready to accompany his uncle. This party in the drawing-room consisted of General Lord Delorme, his windowed sister, the lady Ann Lessington, and her son lord Edward Lessington. They had arrived three weeks before in the United States, by the way of Boston, and had been in New-York ten days. Their object in visiting America was partly a tour of pleasure and partly for lady Lessington to visit her sister, who was the wife of the Governor General of the Canadas. The ball to which they were invited was given expressly to them by the British Consul. Without describing the magnificence of the rooms, the elegance of the entertainment, and the splendor of the gay throngs there assembled, we will pass to an event of the evening, more intimately connected with our story. As General Delorme was walking up and down one of the apartments, conversing with a distinguished New York merchant, who had been presented to him, a gentleman entered, and seeing the former, stood for some moments transfixed, closely regarding his face with a look of the deepest surprise. At length he walked rapidly up to the English consul, and said to him in a tone of singular agitation, `Sir, will you be so kind as to tell me who that gentleman is, with the high, bold fore head and military air!' `That, Mr. Carrol, is General Lord Delorme, whom I told you, you would meet at my house. Come, and let me present you. Yonder is his nephew waltzing with Miss — the belle!' But why are you so agitated?' `I beg pardon, sir, for my confusion. But do you not remember, sir, that seven years ago I came to you with the account of the mysterious disappearance of a lovely child, which I told you I had received from a poor dying woman, on the passage from England?' `I remember it perfectly; and that it was your impression this child belonged to a good family.' `Yes, sir. At the same time, I told you that I had a portrait of a gentleman, copied from a miniature which the child had with her, and also the child's portrait taken, and both sent to England, and placed in a public gallery there, if perchance the friends of the child, might by this means be discovered! Since then, sir, and the sudden disappearance of the child from my house, I heard nothing from her! But now sir that gentleman!' `And what connection has he with the subject, sir?' asked the Consul, with surprise. `The moment I saw his face as I entered, I recognized in it the original of the miniature which the child had round her neck, and which I had copied!' `Is not this a delusion, Mr. Carrol?' `No, sir. Each moment I see it stronger and stronger as well as in his features as when he smiles a vivid resemblance to the child!' `This is very extraordinary.' `It is, sir!' `Yet, I should not wish to speak of this subject to General Delorme without stronger proofs.' `I will go for the miniature. My carriage is at the door!' `Do so, Mr. Carrol. The whole story of this child as you once related it to me, when you solicited my aid in your efforts to trace her parentage, now recurs to me. I am deeply interested in the subject. It may be as you say. Hasten for the miniature, I beg of you!' In less than twenty minutes Mr. Carrol returned and placed the portrait in the Consul's hands. He had no sooner glanced at it than he uttered an exclamation of surprise and astonishment. `You are right, sir. It is his portrait, only some dozen years junior. But to make sure come with me where lord Edward, his nephew, is standing. `My lord, here is a miniature. Have you ever known the original?' `It is the General's!' he answered, taking it and glancing at it!' `Do you mean General Delorme?' `Certainly, sir. I was not aware you had it. It looks a little younger, but the likeness is perfect!' `I am satisfied, Mr. Carrol,' answered the Consul. `Come with me and I will also send for the Earl Delorme to my library. We will then investigate this interesting affair. But, alas! if it should prove true that child was his, what avails to confirm to him her loss!! `It may be that she lives, sir,' said Mr. Carrol warmly. `I have never ceased to believe that she is still alive somewhere; and I have not for one day given up the hope of seeing her. I do not encounter in the streets a young girl of the age she would be now, that I do not intuitively survey her features closely and ask myself if it may not be my lost protege.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. The Miniature. When the message from the Consul came to lord Delorme, he was at the moment in conversation with lord Edward, who was in the act of asking him where he had had the miniature taken which had been shown him by the Consul. `I know of no miniature, Edward,' answered the nobleman. `What have you seen?' Before Lord Edward replied, the message was delivered by an attendant from the Consul, desiring Lord Delorme's presence in the library. `Come, Lord Edward, let us go in together and ask the Consul about this miniature you speak of!' Together they entered the library. The consul met them in the door. `Pardon me, my lord, for taking this liberty; but I have a few words to say to you in private.' `Then I will retire,' answered the young man. `No my lord, remain, if you please. You can hear all I have to say. Be seated!' Lord Delorme having taken a chair, the Consul thus addressed him, while Mr. Carrol sat regarding the features of the nobleman with the most intense interest, comparing them from time to time with those of the miniature he held in his band. `My lord,' said the Consul, `I have taken the liberty of sending for you to ask you if ever you had a miniature of yourself taken?' `This singular question would surprise me, I must confess, sir,' answered Lord Delorme, but that I was just spoken to about a miniature of myself by my nephew. What is this picture you both speak of?' Will you be so kind, first, my lord, to recollect if you ever had a miniature taken?' `Yes, several.' `In lockets?' `No, but one.' `Is that it, my lord?' cried Mr. Carrol, extending that he held in his hand towards him. `This, my lord, is Mr. Carrol, an eminent merchant of this city,' said the consul. `He will explain to you how he came by the picture.' Lord Delorme took the picture in hand, and had no sooner glanced at the face than an ex pression of recognition, mingled with the most intense surprise, came upon his countenance. He stared for full one minute, fixedly regarding the portrait, and then raising his eyes, while his face was the color of marble. `Pray—pray, sir,` he said in a voice tremulous with emotion, and looking towards Mr. Carroll, `can you tell me where you obtained this?' and his hand shook like an aspen leaf as he held it out, with the miniature in it, towards Mr. Carrol. `The last time I saw this miniature I placed it around my child's neck, since which fatal hour I have never beheld either! But quickly tell me, sir! He who can explain how he came by this, must know something of my lost child!' His words were full of the pathos of deep grief. The Consul and Mr. Carrol exchanged glances of gratified intelligence, both being satisfied that now, at last, the parentage of the lovely child was discovered. `Will your lordship be so good as to state in what manner and under what circumstances you last beheld this miniature?' asked Mr. Carrol. `I was returning from London in my carriage, with my little daughter and her nurse, having taken her to town in the morning, to indulge her with a holiday. We left London about an hour before sun-set, I intending to reach home in time to dine at seven, as my villa was but sixteen miles from town. The nurse and child sat on the front seat, and I upon the back; and as I had had this very miniature finished that day, and was taking it home to Lady Delorme, to please the child I took it from its case, and threw it around her neck to amuse her while I took a nap, as was my custom in riding to and from town. The next thing I recollect was being awakened by a cold draught in the carriage, when I saw that one of the doors was open, and that I was alone! It was just dark, nay, nearly dark! Filled with alarm and surprise, I pulled the string of the carriage to stop it and spring to the ground. Where is the nurse and my child? I demanded of the coachman in accents of horror. No one knew. The postman had seen nothing—heard nothing! Yet by some means they were both gone, and the door of the coach I had found open. But without entering into the details of my grief and consternation, and giving you an account of my fruitless search and enquiries, I will briefly add, that ten days afterwards the nurse made her appearance at the villa, where all was mourning, in a state bordering on insanity. She confessed that while I slept she also fell asleep, leaving the child standing against the glass window of the coach, looking out!— That she was awakened by missing the child, when she found the door open and her charge gone. She said that the fastening must have slipped, and that it had fallen out of the carriage into the road. Instantly overwhelmed with a sense of her responsibility, she sprung from the carriage without giving the alarm, hoping to find it unhurt, and with the resolve if it was killed, to take her own life. She represented that after searching up and down the moors all night (for it was while crossing them she missed the child) she sunk exhausted by the way-side. She was taken up by some humane persons and carried into an Inn, where she was ill several days with brain fever; and as soon as she could move she desired them to take her to me, that she might know if the child was found, and if not to confess her own guilt. From that time I have not been able to trace any clue to my daughter. I advertised her in all the papers, offering large rewards even for the least information respecting her either alive or dead; for even the knowledge of her death would have been a relief far preferable to the dreadful state of uncertainty under which we labored. At length, after a year had elapsed, we gave her up as dead, though not without a lingering hope, she might yet live and be restored to us. And now when I inform you, gentlemen, that this miniature is the very one which I placed around her neck the last time I looked upon her, you will not be surprised at the emotion which you have seen me manifest on beholding it under circumstances so extraordinary! Sir, if you regard a father's feelings, make haste to give me such information as you possess in relation to this picture!' `My lord,' answered Mr. Carrol with deep sympathy in his tones, `Seven years ago the past season, I came passenger from England to this port, in a ship which also carried as a steerage passenger, a poor but respectable looking woman, who had with her a young girl of nine or ten years of age. This woman died on the passage and committed the child to my charge. She said that it was not her own; but that she had found it one evening wandering on the moss near London, when it was about five years old.' `My child! This was the eye of my lovely Maria when I lost her,' exclaimed Lord Delorme, deeply interested in this narration. `The woman said she took the child home, and her heart yearned toward it because she had a few days before buried her own little girl about the same age. She said the child was richly dressed and had not only the minature you now hold about its neck, but also a small cross. She gave me the miniature in her dying hands, saying she had repented keeping the child, and hoped that it would be the means of returning her to her friends. She said she had not heard any inquiries after it, which is probable from her obscure situation; and as she removed to another neighborhood and pawned it off for her own little girl suspicion never fastened upon her.' `That child, gentleman, must be my daughter,' answered Lord Delorme with the most profound emotion. `There can be no question of it,' exclaimed earnestly Lord Edward. `How extraordinary!' `I fear from the sad expression upon your face, Mr. Carrol,' said Lord Delorme, `that the child entrusted to you, no longer lives, and that I have found my daughter only to weep over her grave.' `I wish, my lord, I could relieve your anxiety as well as my own touching the fate of this sweet child.' `Then my foreboding's are true. `You shall hear, my lord! I accepted the trust the dying woman confided to me, and took the lovely child to my own house and adopted her as my daughter.' `Thanks, thanks, kind sir.' `I, at the same time, had a portrait taken from this miniature and sent to the — gallery in London, in hopes some one, knowing the original, might see it and so lead to the discovery of her parentage; for, much as the lovely little girl became endeared to us, I felt it my duty to leave no means untried to discover her family.' `Sir, you now have a father's warmest gratitude,' said Lord Delorme. `I have also, my lord, the approval of my own heart. We soon learned to love the child as our own, and each day she wound herself more and more closely around our hearts. I also had a portrait of the child taken with the intention of sending it to London, when—' `A portrait of my child,' exclaimed Lord Delorme with intense excitement. `Where is it? Let me behold it! The sight of it would at once assure me of the identity of this protege of yours with my daughter, if they are one and the same, of which I have no doubt! Where have you this portrait, Mr. Carrol?' `It will be here in a moment, my lord,' answered Mr. Carrol. `After getting back here with the miniature, I recollected the portrait and despatched a servant for it, thinking it would serve to strengthen the testimony I foresaw from your resemblance to the miniature, was about to be brought to bear upon my protege's parentage.' While Mr. Carrol spoke a knock was heard at the door and on opening it he saw the man with the portrait. He took it from him and placing it in a strong light over against the lamp, stepped aside for lord Delorme to look at it. The nobleman and his nephew both eagerly approached to view it and both at the moment exclaimed, `It is she!' `It is my daughter, my long lost child again before me!' continued Lord Delorme, kneeling upon one knee before the picture and gazing upon it with wrapt affection. `Yes, the same delicate brow! the same sweet smile and mouth! the same soft brown hair! Only it is my Maria with more maturity; the maturity that six years would give! In her fifth year she was lost to me, and this was taken you say six years afterwards, Mr. Carrol!' `She was probably eleven when this was painted, my lord!' `So she would have looked at eleven!' `It looks almost as she looked at five, uncle,' said Lord Edward, gazing upon it with surprise and tenderness. `There can now be no manner of doubt as to the identity of the original of this portrait!' `There is even a correct representative of the very cross she wore—her mother's gift,' resumed the nobleman, still kneeling before the picture and regarding its features with the deepest attention and an air of grief mingled with tenderness. The young man also began to fix his eyes upon it with suddenly renewed animation, as if he had all at once discovered in it some half-remembered resemblance of some one. The longer he gazed the stronger this impression grew upon him that he had not only seen the original of that picture before him years past, in childhood, but he had seen the same face recently. But where he could not decide! Still he surveyed it, more and more puzzled, for the longer he looked the deeper grew this impression. `Now, Mr. Carrol, all that remains is for you to inform me of the fate of my child,' said Lord Delorme, rising and turning sadly towards him. `I am persuaded she is no more; therefore tell me when she died and where you have laid her!' `There seems destined, my lord, that all connected with his lovely child should be attended with mystery. A few weeks after I had had this picture taken, my house was broken into by night, by a notorious burglar, who was, however, arrested. But by some stratagem he escaped and the next night the house was also entered, but whether by the same or not I cannot tell. The alarm was given by a servant, and as I was rushing from my room I heard the wild cries of Maria from the rear of the house. Appalled at the sound, for I supposed she was fast asleep in her little bed, I flew down stairs, her cries ringing in my ears— `Save me, father, Oh, save me!' `Would to God I, her father, had been there to answer her cries! Go on sir,' said the nobleman with deep excitement. `I reached the gate and leaping into the lane saw a carriage at the other end just driving off at a furious rate. I suspected that Maria had been borne away in it and giving the alarm I started in swift pursuit. But it was out of sight when I got to the head of the lane and I saw it no more. Three days afterwards the body of the burglar Shears, who had broken into my house was found floating in a dock in East River, with a deep knife wound in his breast. All search after Maria proved fruitless and at length I gave her up as dead!' `And from that moment you have not seen nor heard from the hapless girl?' asked lord Edward. `No, my lord. It is my belief she horribly perished in some way connected with the burglar's death; for I cannot but believe that he was the person who abducted her; for he escaped the day after he was taken in my house, and doubtless came the next night and carried off the child out of revenge!' `It is doubtless so. But how he should come to a sudden death and no traces of the child is extraordinary,' said Lord Edward.— Was there any suspicion how this notorious burglar got his death wound.' `No, my lord. It was doubtless in some broil among his associates who threw his body into the river to conceal the act!' `But my child—my child. What became of my child?' cried the nobleman in the deepest anguish. `Was there no child's body found near that time?' asked Lord Edward. `None. I made every inquiry but without being able to get hold of the least clue to unravel the mystery that hung around her sudden disappearance from beneath my roof!' `Mr. Carrol,' said Lord Delorme in a tone at once solemn and despondingly, `do you have the least hope that my child lives?' `I have never, my lord, given up the hope of once more seeing or hearing from her. It is my opinion she lives, though perhaps dead to us who are so deeply interested in the knowledge of the fact!' `Oh that I could believe that I should once more behold her! But no! There is not the least probability! She is no more! Alas! that I should have discovered thus much! that I should have dispelled one painful mystery hanging about her first disappearance, to be plunged into the mazes of another still more distressing! Is there no clue by which we might sift this matter to the bottom?' `I would recommend, my lord,' replied the Consul `that an advertisement be inserted in the principal papers of the city, referring to the events narrated by Mr. Carrol, and offering a large reward for any information that may throw light upon her present condition.' `It shall be done. Edward you will write such an advertisement, and be so good as to have it in the paper to-morrow. My child may yet live, and I may yet embrace her! By this time she would be seventeen! Alas! if living, into what fearful moral degradation may she not have been plunged. Nevertheless, she would be still my child!' The parties so deeply interested in the fate of the lovely wanderer after some further discussion upon the subject, retired from the library. Lord Delorme called his carriage and sought his rooms at the Astor, where he had related all he had heard to his sister, lady Lessington, who listened with surprise, that cannot be described but may be imagined. It was her opinion, after Maria's first preservation so wonderfully, that she was destined again to re-appear; and that both would yet behold her. She was all hope and joy, and communicated new energies to the depending spirits of lord Delorme. Edward was not disposed to retire so early from the ball, and lingered till twelve, when he left, and wrapped in his cloak, pursued his way alone, thinking upon the extraordinary revelations he had heard. As he came near the lane which turned down to the abode of the lovely cigar-vender, he was inspired by a idesire to pass her window and recall her sweet mage, quite forgetting his promise made to his mother. As he came near, he saw a man looking by the door in a suspicious manner, and he paused in the shade, the closer to observe his operations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. The Assassin. The person whom the young nobleman discovered was Ruyter, the convict. Edward watched him closely, for he well knew the character of the neighborhood in which the beautiful cigar-girl lived, and he had spoken to her about the danger of dwelling in such a quarter of the city, delieately offering to her at the same time such means as would enable her to choose a better abode. This offer, however, the young girl gratefully declined, acting in this instance as in all other cases with that charming propriety which characterized her. `If the house were not so wretched I should suspect this fellow of burglary. But he must have some other motive than treasure. Nay! what treasure is more valuable than the lovely cigar-vender who dwells there! She must be the object and I am providentially here!' While he was making these mental observations, Ruyter had slipped the pannel as we have seen, and to the surprise of Edward darted through it and disappeared. He immediately approached the door and softly sliding the pannel back again (for the convict had replaced it) he endeavored to pass through; but being stouter about the shoulders than Ruyter he was unable to get in as he had done. He, however, by passing his arm through the aperture succeeded in reaching up to the key on the inside and unlocking the door. As it opened he entered and listened. A door closed softly above him. He groped his way up the stairs and entered the room into which Ruyter had already preceeded him.— As he went in the convict had sprung a dark lantern and as Edward entered he saw him advancing towards a bed the lantern in one hand and a gleaming blade in the other. Intent on his murderous purpose Ruyter was not conscious that his steps were followed, for he believed that the door below was firmly secured. Edward saw that the man's purpose was murder, and with noiseless advance drew near and stood over him ready to arrest his hand. The curtain of the bed was partly drawn aside and Ruyter saw lying asleep in it the victim of his vengeance and also, to his surprise, the beautiful face of a young girl.— This discovery seemed to startle him and lowering his knife he gazed upon her with wonder. He feared also to do the murder he had contemplated; and stood deliberating. The young nobleman also saw the lovely sleeper by the light of the convict's lantern and he let his eye dwell upon the sweet features with deep admiration. All at once Ruyter placed his knife and lantern upon the floor, and taking a cravat from his neck, muttered. `This shall do it! The thing can be done quietly by passing this round her throat, and the girl not be waked!' He twisted the handkerchief hard into a rope, and was bending over the unconscious sleeper, when Edward with a quick movement over the head of the assassin, seized both ends of this twisted cravat, wrested it from his grasp and with the rapidity of lightning took a double turn with it round his neck; then drawing the ends together with a strong hand, he threw the astonished and alarmed convict backwards upon the floor, and placed his foot upon his breast. `Lie there villain!' he cried sternly, `and offer to move a muscle and with your own knife I will strike you to the heart!' Alarmed by the fall Madame de Ruyter and Maria both awoke in terror. Their consternation on seeing a man standing in the middle of the chamber with his foot upon the body of another nearly paralyzed them.— Neither could give utterance to the cry that rose to their lips. A second glance told Maria that one of them was the handsome stranger; and deep blushes instantly chased away the paleness of fear, while instinctively she drew the curtain towards her to hide herself; yet filled with wonder and fear! `Do not be alarmed,' said the young man in tones that at once inspired confidence in the breast of Madame de Ruyter, for Maria's fears were already vanishing at the sight of one whom she was at the moment she awaked pleasantly dreaming, `this man I saw breaking into your house and following him into this room prevented him from doing murder. But for my providential interference in arresting his hand you madam would have been the victim.' Both of the ladies shrieked, and Madame de Ruyter trembled with horror, as she recognized the dark features of her late husband! `It is well for you, Madam, growled the as sassin, that this chap happened to be at hand; for I had sworn to take your life. That young girl, who, I suppose is one of your brats, I would then have taken into my possession. Come, friend your foot is rather heavy on my breast bone, and I dont like this cravat being quite so tight!' `Get to your feet, fellow, but I shall retain my grasp upon this handkerchief. Now come with me. When I am gone ladies, you can secure the doors, and doubtless will meet no further interruption to-night. I did not speak to you, fair Maria without cause, for dwelling in such a neighborhood!' `To-morrow we leave it, sir, for a better house,' answered Madame de Ruyter. `You should do so. Good night, Madame, and rest secure, for I will place a watchman in charge of the premises for the remainder of the night. Good night, my friend!' he added looking towards the blushing girl. `Now fellow, come with me! The least attempt on your part to escape, will make your knife point, and heart's blood acquainted!' The young nobleman then led him out of the chamber by a grasp upon the cravat, and holding Ruyter's own knife in his other hand above his breast. The convict suffered himself to be led in this way in dogged silence to the street, where Edward gave him into the hands of two watchmen, who, hearing the noise had hastened to the scene, and telling them the nature of his offence, told them to guard him with unwonted vigilence. Madame de Ruyter from her window saw this transfer to the custody of the watchmen, and felt relieved. `He is now in security, Maria, and I need no longer tremble! I feared that he would seek my life! How providential my escape. Who could this brave young gentleman be? He called you by name! You must know him, dear!' `He is the one who gave me the forget-me-not, my dear mother,' answered the loving girl with grateful joy. `I tell you that now because I feel, after what he has done, you will not censure me for loving him!' `No never, my sweet child! But do you love him?' `With all my heart, and now more than ever!' she answered with fervent emotion. `And this is why you cannot love my poor boy, who idolizes you! Well, dear child, I canot help it now, only I pity Herman! Who is this young man?' `Indeed, dear mother, I have never asked his name. I only know that he calls himself Edward!' `Well, dear, I hope good will come of it.— He has certainly shewn himself a brave man, and looks like a perfect gentleman. I hope good will come of it! But then was it not strange he should have been about here at this time of the night!' `I do not know, mother,' answered Maria,' but feeling she could very truly guess. There was some further conversation, during which Madame de Ruyter convinced herself that Herman had no place in the heart of her lovely protege, and that he was rather feared than loved. She sighed for him, knowing well the violence of his character, and how fearfully the knowledge of this fact would affect him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. The Advertisement. It was about nine o'clock the morning following that Wilkins Wild was seated at a table in the tap-room of the Saracen's head, taking a cup of coffee and reading the morning's paper which had just been thrown into the door by a news-boy. Plymp and Napes sat on the opposite side of the table smoking cigars. `What news, Captain?' asked the former, lighting a fresh cigar. `I dont see any thing.' Ah—yes I do, though! Here is your chum in a fix Napes!' `What—Ruyter?' Yes! Here he is in the Police report!' `I'm glad of it.' answered both burglars, venting their satisfaction in deep oaths.— `What has he done? added Napes. `He went out after you left ns, and I saw no more of him! Has he killed any body?' `Here is the account. I will read it,' answered Wild, throwing himself back in his chair with his feet laid across the corner of the table: `A villanous looking fellow by the name of Ruyter, known as `sharp knife' among his fellows, was brought up for an attempt at murder. He was detected by a gentleman breaking into a house in — street, where but for him he would have murdered a female in bed. This person arrested him in the very act of taking her life, and delivered him into the custody of the watchmen. This Ruyter was recently pardoned out of State's prison, where he was sentenced for life fourteen years ago, for a highway robbery and murder. The woman he attempted to murder was his wife before his incarceration. He was fully cemmitted for trial, the gentleman, who arrested him, and whom we learn is Lord Edward Lessington, at present sojourning here, appearing against him, as well as Madame de Ruyter, whom the Justice, at his lordship's request, sent for.' `Then Ruyt' is fixed comfortably for the rest of his life,' said Plymp. `I never liked the man. He was too fond of blood.' `Yes, we are peaceable pick-locks and do no mans any injury,' answered Napes with an air of self satisfaction. `Very innocent gentlemen we are all, no doubt,' remarked Wild dryly. `So this villain has tried to kill his poor wife. It is well Herman was not the one who arrested him, for he would have taken his life, father or no father on the spot. Where is Herman, daine?' asked Wild laying down the paper and turning his head towards the bar. `He went out early this morning. But come here, Wilk', I have a word to say.' `Well, wife, what is it?' he asked approaching her and leaning over the bar towards her. `Have you been sounding Waldeigh's premises?' `Yes. I was there by sun-rise. I went as a brick-layer sent by the landlord to examine the flues! I went all through the house. It was richly furnlshed and I am confident old Waldeigh had Herman's money to do it with! I have all my plans arranged for having him your guest to night, dame, provided we can't bring him to terms in his own house. He has but two servants besides a foot-boy, and only himself and sister. Napes and Plymp are to be my aids.' `Well they will do if they can keep sober.' `They have both promised me to drink nothing stronger than coffee to day.' `What hour have you fixed upon?' `Eight o'clock.' `Ho, captain,' called out Napes from the table and holding the newspaper in his hand. `Here is a windfull for some luckly fellow if he gets.' `What is it?' carelessly inquired Wild as he returned to his seat and resumed the position of his feet across the table. `A bouncing reward offered!' `How much?' `One thousand dollars!' `One thousand?' repeated Wild. `Let me see the paper!' The burglar surrendered it and Wild then read aloud— ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS REWARD! The above reward will be paid to any person who will communicate any information concerning a little girl of ten years old who mysteriously disappeared from the dwelling of Mr. Carrol, Washington square, seven years ago this month. This child if living must be now seventeen years of age, with blue eyes, fair brown hair and a delicate complexion. The above reward will be paid for such information as may lead to a knowledge of her fate whether she be now living or dead! Apply to Parlor No. —, Astor House!' When the burglar Captain had finished reading this advertisement, he compressed his lips and let his clenched hand fall with an emphasis upon the table till the wares upon it rung again. `What? Do you know any thing about this, Captain?' asked Napes, eagerly. `I'll wager an X he does!' responped Plymp. `Not I. I know nothing,' he answered evasively. `I was only thinking what a capital hawl that would be if I did know!' In a moment or two afterwards Wild got up and in a lounging manner wholly calculated to lull suspicion that this movement was owing to the advertisement, he went out of the tap. On gaining the street he walked rapidly in the direction of Madam de Ruyter's dwelling. As he went he thus gave utterance to his thoughts. `I have it now! It is as clear as day-light! That very girl Herman called his sister is the the original of the portrait I saw at Mr. Carroll's. That is why I have been so troubled with her face from the moment I saw her in the tap. I had recognised its resemblance to that portrait—that portrait which I recollect that boy, as he was, fell in love with from my description. There is no mistake. This young girl is just the age, too, that this child would be now. There is no doubt that Herman stole her off, and — ah! a new light breaks upon me. This girl was said at the time to have been seen to be taken into the carriage by a man while a lad sprung up behind. This then will give me a clue to the mystery that hangs around Shear's path; for I well knew Shears took off this young girl. The death of Shears, the disappearance of the girl and Herman, also, all at the same time, link the three events together; and now I know that this sister of Herman is neither more nor less than the young girl that Shears carried off.— How Herman mixed himself with the affair I cant tell; but one thing is certain, his mother has the girl beneath her own roof. I will see him and have a talk with him! If what I suspect about Shears is true, Herman is in my power. Here is the house! He ascended the stairs and knocked at the upper door. It was opened by Herman. He was in a state of great excitement, for his mother, who had just returned from the Police court, where she had entered her complaint against her late husband, was relating the whole affair to him. Herman had been in but a little while, early as he had risen; for he had met Maria at the street door as she was going to her new rooms in Nassau street, to get them all ready to move into. On the way he poured out all his heart before her. On reaching the rooms she desired him to be seated, and calmly listen to her while she spoke with him. She then in a gentle way, and with a sweet dignity becoming a maiden at such a crisis, told him that her regard for him was only sisterly, and that as a sister she loved him with great affection. `More than this, Herman,' she said with a voice slightly tremulous, `I can never be to you!' We will not attempt to portray the scenes of wild passion—tears, pleadings, recriminations, and fearful wrath which this confession produced. During all he did not ask her if she loved another, nor did she make this confession; for she feared for the life of him she loved. `Well, be it so! he said bitterly, after pouring out, not upon her, but upon himself, the bitterest denunciations for loving as he had done, and deceiving his heart. `Be it so, Maria! From this time I am a reckless man —a man of blood! You know what my early career was, and that I turned from it that I might be worthy of your pure love. I sought honors and a good name, that I might lay them at your feet! I shunned temptation for your sake! I kept your image upon the altar of my heart and daily worshipped it there.— Each day by your power in me and over me, I grew better. I looked forward to happiness only in your presence. But—why—why— do I recapitulate these things! Why do I open my mouth! You are lost to me forever! Cruel, ungrateful! But I will not curse you! I love you, and I refrain from speaking the words of bitterness that rush from my crushed heart to my burning lips. Sister's love? Nay—I want no love but that love which answers to mine! I am sorry, Maria—I am sad and sorrowful—for I know that from this hour I have neither helm, nor chart, nor compass!' As he thus gave utterance to his emotion he hastily left her, and rushed into the street. He sought his mother and poured the tale of grief into her sympathising ear. From her he first learned that she loved another! Who it was he, also, learned from her; and when he was told it was he who had saved his mother's life, he buried his face in his hands and wept passionately; for he felt that he could not injure the life of the noble youth who had saved his mother's!' It was during this painful interview that Wild knocked at the door. `Well!' said Herman, almost savagely. `Do you come for me to do crimes! If so, I am ready!' and he laughed so wildly that the burglar captain believed for a moment that he was insane. `No, Herman, I have not come to get you to engage in any new affair; but to see you about an old one!' `Well what is it?' `Can your mother leave the room a moment?' `Go mother! Now we are alone! What would you with me?' he asked gloomily. `I have long wanted to ask you, Herman, about the death of Shears!' and the burglar eyed him closely. `There have some circumstance lately come to light that lead me to believe, who was the author of it?' Herman colored deeply, and then became suddenly pale. This emotion confirmed, Wild in his belief. `Who do you suspect?' asked Herman. `You!' answered Wild firmly. `Me?' answered Herman starting from his chair. `Yes, and you may as well confess it. But read that! and you will see I know something more!' and he placed the newspaper he had brought with him, in his hand. He watched his countenance while he read it. Herman's hand which held the newspaper trembled like a leaf as he finished the perusal. He looked up at Wild, with a look of alarm and suspicion. `Well, what is this to me?' he asked hoarsely. `That you are not only in some way concerned in the death of Shears, but that the young girl here described, is the very same I saw you protect from Napes and Plymp in the tap! I recognized her by the portrait I saw at Mr. Carrol's!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. The Burglar's Discovery. Herman remained a few moments after this hold charge from Wild buried in deep and troubled thought. At length he raised his head, and fixing hts eyes full upon him said,— `Wilkins, you have guessed right. You are my friend, and I will tell you the whole story! He then went on to relate in detail the incidents as they occurred. When Herman had ended his recital, the events given in which have already been made known to the reader,* * See the novel entitled `La Bonita Cigarrera,' or the `Beautiful Cigar Vender.' the burglar captain. started up with an exclamation of surprise and admiration. `This then is the way Shears came to his end!' he at length said with deep emphasis. `Well, I am glad this mystery is solved. I never had anything perplex me so in my life as accounting for his death! Well, Herman, it was a bold deed and like yourself! Now what have you in view touching this young girl? It is plain that the one I saw you fight so bravely for in the tap at `the Saracen,' and the one you rescued from Shears, are one and the same, though you have not yet acknow ledged so much to me. You have read the advertisement! It describes her exactly. A thousand dollars isn't got every sunny morning!' `What does your language mean?' demanded Herman, his brow darkening. `Do I understand you?' `There is no use fooling the matter Herman between us. You acknowledge the young girl to be the same advertised here?' `I do; what then?' he demanded haughtily. `That we give her up and go shares, half and half in the reward!' `Wild, are you in earnest?' he asked in a tone fearfully subdued by his efforts to suppress his deep wrath. `Yes, my boy!' `So am I,' thundered Herman. `Dare to think of carrying out this hellish plan of yours, and you shall die by my hand! This maiden has been reared and educated by my mother as my sister! Such she is to me, and as such I will protect her! Hear me—for now you have unmasked yourself—I will deal in plain words with you! By accident you have recognized this person to be the original of the picture you saw at Mr. Carrol's, and you are the only one that recognises her to be the one sought for by those who penned this advertisement. Who they are, or why it is written, I know not, nor do I care! But this I say, that if you breathe a word of your knowledge to any living soul, I will be your murderer!' `I do not fear your menaces, Herman,' responded Wild, with a reckless laugh; and at the same time he began to move towards the door, with the inward purpose to hasten at once to the Astor House to give the information sought. But Herman divined his object, and placed himself between him and the door. `By the Creator that made me, Wild, you shall not stir out of this room till you have sworn to keep silence touching this discovery you have made!' `Herman, this is going a little too far,' cried Wild through his clenched teeth, his eyes glowing with rage. `Let me pass out, for I swear to you I will take no oath of yours or any other man's dictation!' `You will not!' `No!' firmly answered the burglar captain, and with the utterance of the words he drew a pistol from his bosom and cocking it, levelled it at Herman's heart. `Stand back and let me pass forth, or I pass across your body!' Quick as this act of the burglar-captain had been, the motion of Herman's hand, with which he knooked the weapon from his grasp, was quicker! Flying into the air it struck the ceiling and exploded, while the two men fiercely grappled with each other. Herman was struggling for the preservation of her whom he loved better than life, and he was resolved that the burglar should not betray her existence to those who would take her from him forever! for he believed her parents were at length moving in this search after her, and well aware that she must be of a superior condition in life, he felt that her discovery by them would prevent forever a barrier to the union which (notwithstanding all his crushed hopes) he still trusted might be brought about according to his soul's desire; for true love never desponds. The contest was short but terrific. After a little more than a minute from their first falling together upon the floor, the young man rose to his feet, and wiping the red blood from a seaman's clasp-knife, he closed it and returned it to his pocket! The burglar-captain moved not! He lay upon his back with his face upward! From his heart bubbled forth a torrent of blood which formed a pool around him. His features were fixed and his eye glazed. He was dead!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. The Rivals. We left our heroine at the apartments which she had been turnishing for Madame de Ruyter, and where Herman had his unhappy interview with her. He returned as we have seen, to his mother's, where Wild called upon him, the fatal issue of which interview we have just seen. After Herman quitted Maria she sat down and wept for him, and for herself, that she should be the cause of his grief, for she felt grateful to him, and wished from her heart she could requite his affection. As the hour was now close at hand when she should be at the shop, she dried her tears and resuming her hat and shawl she locked the neatly arranged rooms and tripped lightly away towards her place of daily duties. On her way she was turned aside from her usual course by a crowd gathered around a small building on fire, and to avoid it she passed into the street in which the stall of Brant the Book-man was situated. She had not yet got in sight of it, when Brant, who was seated in his dark box reading a newspaper, was startled by the sudden and abrupt appearance of Herman. `Rolfe, you are my friend. Let me conceal myself in your lodging-rooom! I have just slain the burglar Wilkins Wild, and his body is fresh and bleeding in the door of my mother's house, and which is round the corner, beyond the Saracen's Head!' `You have saved the judge and hangman trouble, if you have killed this villain,' answered Rolfe with a smile of pleasure. `I liked him not, for he always had an insult for my deformity! Go in,' he continued, throwing open the low door in the rear of his stall. There you will be safe, till some other place offers! Did any one see you do the deed?' `No one!' `Then feel secure! I will shut you in, and by and by, go up the street and see upon whom men fasten suspicion.' As the Book-man turned the key in the door to his cell, for such the room in the rear of his stall may very properly be termed, he cast his eyes up and down the street, preparatory to going on his mission. He suddenly started and his cheeks became flushed while his eyes sparkled with intense emotion. Not ten steps from him approaching the stall along the side-walk, he beheld the lovely girl whom he had before seen accompanying Madame de Ruyter, and for whom he had then been seized with the most violent passion—a passion that changed his whole nature. A second time he had seen her walking alone, and as he passed her he sent forth his deep burning glance into her eyes, and under his breath he whispered, `For thy love, maiden, I would die! Deformed as I am—base and low as you see me, I have a soul that can appreciate your worth. Think of me sometimes, and do not despise the true heart which for years has throbbed only with throes of sorrow, until the sight of your sweet countenance thrilled my veins with joy unutterable—and hopes high and daring seized upon my thoughts. Nay! tremble not! Fly me not! Pass on thy way, innocent and fair! I have spoken with thee and I am happy! Go—but I feel within my soul's depths that you will never forget me!' And the Book-man spoke truly. Though surprised and alarmed at being thus addressed in the street by a stranger of such a singular aspect, Maria listened to his words with a feeling akin to gentle pity, and wondering she went on her way; but she could not banish him from her mind. Her emotion when Herman alluded to him will be remembered by the reader. In her haste to reach her shop, Maria did not think of the Book-man's stall being in her way; for since he had met her and spoken with her so strangely, she avoided the neighborhood of his dwelling. She first became conscious of being near him by seeing his dark eyes gazing upon her from beneath the shadowy arches of his brows. Instinctively she dropped her veil, and drawing it closely around her face, she averted her head and hurried by. As she left the stall behind her she almost flew! `She fears aud shuns me!' he said bitterly. `If I were shapely in person and fair in visage she would have smiled upon me! But now as I am she avoids me as if I were a wild beast! She must learn to love me! I am hideoue without; but I will so make her fall in love with my mind that she shall love me! This passion I entertain for her is not awakened to perish without purpose. Our destinies are interwoven by fate, or my heart would never have bounded to her foot-step as it has done. Fly, maiden, fly! but we shall meet again. She can be found at Herman's mother's and her own! I will hie there now and see what men say of this deed of blood.' As he spoke he left his stall and took his way in the direction of the Saracen's head.— When he reached the tavern and turned the corner, he encountered a throng of people, who were gathered around the dwelling where Wild lay, having been drawn together by the outcries raised by Madame de Ruyter on returning to her room and discovering the murdered man upon her floor. Maria had seen the crowd, but had avoided it, being already late for her duties at the shop, and not knowing the object which had set it in motion.— Rolfe reached the scene and listening to the numerous conjectures of the multitude, was satisfied that the true criminal was unsuspected. He then approached Madame de Ruyter who was pacing up and down her room ringing her hands, for she believed that Herman had done the murder, and she trembled lost she should each instant hear the cry given of his being arrested. `Calm yourself, madam,' said Rolfe in a low tone. `Your son is safe. Your grief will draw suspicion on you. Compose yourself and Herman will be with you as soon as the momentary excitement passes. Where is your child?' `My child? you said he was safe? Is he not in safety?' she asked wildly. `I mean your daughter!' `My daughter! Yes—oh yes—did I say she was not my daughter, sir?' she asked bewildered, and looking as if she feared she had unwittingly betrayed what she should kept secret. `No you did not. Is she thy daughter?' asked the keenly watchful Book-man. `She is the only daughter I ever had.' `Madame, your answers are singular. You have made me suspect she is not your child. I never knew you had any other than Herman.' `Who is she then if she be not my child?' asked Madam de Ruyter with firmness, sensible of her danger. `I know not,' answered Rolfe turning away and mixing with the crowd, still strongly suspecting that the fair maiden was not the sister of Herman; for the young seaman on first returning home had inquired after, and spoken of her with a tone more like that of a lover than a brother. Nevertheless,' he said as he walked slowly away towards his stall, `nevertheless she may be his sister.— Now that I know her abode I will see her again, for my life is hid in hers.' `Well, Rolfe?' said Herman as the Book-man unlocked his door and entered the little room in which he had left him. `No one suspects you. You may venture abroad in safety.' `Thanks, good Brant. Did you see my mother? `Yes, and left her composed after assuring her of your safety.' `Thanks again.' `Herman you have a sister,' said Rolfe in a tone full of emphasis and feeling. `Well?' responded Herman with surprise. `I love her!' answered Brant in a voice that came from the depths of his chest. `Love her? cried Herman recoiling a step and fixing his eyes fiercely upon him. `Yes, Herman, dearer than life I love her.' `Go on—what more?' demanded Herman pale as marble, his lips compressed and his hand trembling though clinched till the nails of the fingers met in the quick flesh of the palms. `I mean to woo and win her. We are friends! I have money—I am rich! I ask your consent and I— `Rolfe—' `Why do you falter, Herman?' asked the Book-man calmly. `I will not falter, then! Know that my sister can never love thee, and that you shall never have my consent. Nay—by the heaven above our heads, if you dare think of her again I will—' `Stop, Herman! I am satisfied now that she is not your sister!' `Who is she then?' `The daughter of Mr. Carrol who so mysteriously disappeared seven years ago!' `Ha?' gasped Herman. `Read that advertisement. It throws light upon by-gone events I have long had my thoughts upon, and I believe that this maiden is the person here advertised, for you disappeared at the same time she did; and that very night I saw you from my stall in the storm, convey something into your mother's house, which, after I heard of the child's dis appearance I knew must have been a little girl. But I saw no more of you and the subject escaped me. Now I find in your mother's house (and loved by you, for you cannot disguise it,) a maiden who is neither her daughter, nor your sister, and who answers perfectly to the description in this advertisement. Read it!' `I have read it, Brant,' answered Herman, hoarsely. `Would you also claim the reward? Beware! It was for this I slew Wild!' `No. I desire no other reward than her young heart! Perish the money! I love her and it shall be my part to keep her existence secret from those who seek her. She must be mine, and none other's!' `Thine accursed!' cried Herman, seizing him by the throat, fierce with rage, that he should dare to speak of love with reference to one he adored, as he did his lovely foster-sister! `Herman, take off your hands' Goad me not to resentment!' shrieked the Book-man. `I will tear out thy foul tongue?' `Forbear and unloose my throat, or I will kill thee!' `Base spawn I defy thee! To dare lift your thoughts to her! It is madness! Down, and grovel in the dust, hound!' Herman, as he spoke tried to press the head of the dwarf to the earth, so that he could place his foot upon his neck. But strong as he was, he miscalculated his own powers, compared with that of the massive-shouldered Book-man. With a strong exertion of muscular strength. Rolfe threw him from him, and then uttering a short, panther-like cry, he sprung upon him, and clasped his long, thin fingers about his neck. He then dashed his large head violently several times in rapid succession into his face, till the poor young man suffocated and overpowered fell backward heavily to the floor, where he lay as insensible as marble. The Book-man drew from his bosom a slender machete, and stooping over him drove it to the hilt in his heart! Thrice he repeated the blow, and then getting up he said as he gazed upon him, `There lies the only man, who stood between me and happiness! Thus let him perish, who dares to be Rolfe Brant's rival in love!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. The Mystery Unraveled. It was about half past seven o'clock, the evening of the day on which these tragic events occurred, that lord Delorme and his sister, lady Lessington were seated at the teatable in their rooms at the Astor. They were speaking of the extraordinary series of circumstances, by which they had obtained intelligence of the lost ehild up to her disappearance from the house of Mr. Carrol, and were sadly discussing the hopeless chances that they should ever hear of her again. `What can Edward have meant,' said lady Lessington, `by his wild words just now, and rising from the table, and rushing out as he did so like a mad-man, crying, `I have it! I have it! The riddle is solved, and it is she! `I cant explain his conduct. But all day he has had something in his thoughts perplexing, and once I heard him say, to himself, the face of that child's portrait haunts me, with a vague resemblance to some one, and each instant I would fix upon the person the connecting link I sought would vanish!' Evidently he has seen some one whom the portrait reminds him of, but who it is he is not able to fasten upon!' `It would be extraordinary if Edward had by chance met with her somewheres, and now traces the resemblance! Perhaps his sudden departure from the table and his words had something to do with the fastening this resemblance upon the person whose image has been vaguely seen in his mind!' They were right in their conjectures. Lord Edward had again and again that day gazed upon the portrait of the lovely child which was in lord Delorme's possession, and the more he gazed the more certain he felt that he had somewheres seen the face! But where, as is often the case, in seeking out vaguely defined resemblances in the memory, he had met with it, he found it impossible to tell. The reader, however, will be at no loss! and when it is borne in mind that the likeness he was trying to fix and individualize, was that of a portrait of a young girl at ten, and the face of the same person beheld in her seventeenth year, his perplexity will not be surprising. But all day his thoughts were upon it, when suddenly the truth flashed upon his mind at a moment, when he had the portrait and the face of the lovely girl at ths same instant in his mind. Then face answered to face as in a mirror, and their identity was clear, and decided. He hastened from the hotel to the VignMort and not finding her there in an assumed careless tone inquired for her of the proprietor. From him he understood that she had gone to her mother's, having been sent for on account of her sudden illness. The scenes she had gone through that day had deeply affected this lady and when she sent for Maria to see her she was near her end. Of the murder of Herman she had not heard, for the Book-man having done the deed in secret took care to remove the body and all traces of their act of blood from his dark and solitary abode. On reaching the dwelling of Madam de Ruyter, Lord Edward ascended the stairs and entered the room. Upon the bed lay the dying woman. Over her, bent weeping, the lovely girl he sought. The young nobleman advanced with sympathy in his looks and knelt by the side of the bed with an air of respectful sorrow. Maria on seeing him blushed deeply and would have risen but he said to her— `Do not move. Let us together watch her last moments!' `Is it the noble youth? Ah, sir, Heaven has sent you,' said the dying woman with faint articulation. `You are good and honorable, for I see these sentiments in your countenance. You are her only protector under God. To you I solemnly commit her!' `I take the trust which you confide to me, in truth and sincerity, my dear Madam!' answered Lord Edward with emotion. `Tell me then truly, is she your daughter?' `No—no! I have deceived full long! Do not trouble, Maria! The knowledge of the truth will not now affect you. You need not now fear exposure with being charged with the murder of that man Shears, which alone has so long intimidated you! No, sir, she is not my daughter! A burglar in breaking into the house of Mr. Carrol, not finding booty, seized upon her, believing her to be his child, hoping to get large ransom fer her. My son slew him and rescued the child whom, boy as he was, he loved and conveyed her to my house. Then, at his urgent desire I connived at the concealment of the sweet child whom he resolved never to part from.— She was prevented from making known who she was by the subtilty of Herman, who excited her apprehensions with the idea that as she would be asserted as the murderer of the man who carried her off, he being killed by Herman in her presence! If I have done wrong God knows I have repented it!' `You have doubtless done wickedly, madam,' said the young man. `But Providence has directed these things to a termination you little anticipated. I will tell you what will rolieve your mind at this solemn hour. Here is an advertisement,' he continued taking a paper from his pocket, `which please listen to!' When he had ended reading it, the poor woman clasped her hands together in deep emotion. `Oh, sir, do her parents live?' `Yes—her father! He is now in this city! He is an English nobleman and my uncle. Satisfied that this lovely girl was her we sought, I came here to question her as to her only recollections. Your words have left no room for doubt. This young girl is my cousin and to my mother, who is in the city, I shall at once consign her. You see, therefore, that she will not be without suitable protectors!' Madame de Ruyter extended her arms with an expression of deep joy upon her pale countenance to embrace Maria, and then pressing the hand of the young nobleman she said fervantly, `Now do I die in peace!' The next moment the spirit of Madam de Ruyler had taken its flight. The surprise and joy of the young maiden on hearing the words of Lord Edward were at once lost in the deep grief with which the loss of her dear friend and foster-mother overwhelmed her. At length soothed by her noble cousin, and feeling that all she had heard him say was a dream, she suffered him to conduct her to a carriage, which he had called to as it was going by, and convey her to his mother and her father! The seene that passed on the entrance of Lord Edward with the lovely girl, whose features clearly spoke her claim to her noble birth-right, cannot be described. She gave her happy father her whole story, while Lord Edward sat at her, listening with deep and tender interest, and perfectly happy that he could now make his wife her, to whom, in a humble station, he had lost his heart. After some discussion as to the best mode of proceeding, now that she was once more in their possession it was decided unanimously that there should be nothing said to the proprietor of the cigar-mart, nor to any person whatsoever touching this discovery of her birth; but that she should leave with them early the next day for Boston, and at once proceed with them to England. The motive for this secrecy was to spare her own feelings as well as those of her father in her new position, by protecting her from any allusion to her late situation as a cigar-girl; it being deemed best that this precauiion should be made to guard her against any reproach tha might follow her into the new life before her. The next day, therefore, the whole party left for Boston, and two days afterwards took the packet for England. The mystery that involved her sudden disappearance and the excitement it produced in New York is already familiar to the reader. Three years careful education under the best tutors and governnesses completed her education, and in her twentieth year Lord Edward led her to the altar, where all joined in confessing her to be the loveliest and most accomplished bride that had for years graced the nuptial records of any one of the British aristocracy. Brant the Book-man, who had never been suspected of murdering Herman, who, indeed, had not been missed, had not believed, from the first, in the death of the lovely girl, and used every means, and expending much money, to ascertain where she was, but without success. At length after she had been absent a little more than three years he believed he had got trace of her, which was very favorable; for in a few days aftewards he sailed in the steamer for England, since when we have lost all knowledge of him.
