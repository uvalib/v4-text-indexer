      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. THE ANCIENT TENEMENT. In a narrow cross-way that leads from the Court House Square northward losing itself in Old Cornhill, there stands, or did stand at the period of our story, a low wooden edifice, without any thing particuliar to draw the attention of the eyes of the passers-by save its antiquity and dilapidated condition. Two very stooping stories in height, very long in the direction of the length of the alley, of a black weather-color, its roof patched here and there with tough gray moss and its foundation sunken at least eighteen inches below the pavement, it doubtless dated anterior to the revolution. The alley in which it stood was but a few feet in breadth, and was so closely filled on both sides with buildings appropriate to occupations of various kinds, that it was quite jammed up in the corner, as it were, and very much in the way of modern innovations and improvements. Nevertheless, worthless as this tenement was, it had various occupants. The lower floor was tenanted by a little cobbler who with his family rented two rooms, by an African boot-black and second-hand clothes' broker, who had also two rooms on the right hand of the dark passage into which the sunken door admitted whomsoever had the courage to risk his body beneath the tottering lintel. On one side of the door-way was the cobbler's tin sign, reading “Kalee Kemp Shoe-maker.” and under the letters of the name was the expressive and intelligible representation of a shoe done in black paint upon a light blue ground. Opposite this sign on the left of the door was “Handy Boot-Blak and old Kloze to sel and For to By.” Over the cobbler's sign hung a pair of patched boy's boots as a specimen of Kaleb's skill, and around the sign of the African broker were suspended upon a cross-stick secured by a string to a nail, sundry well-cleansed trowsers, coat and waistcoats looking far more shining than when they were new, proud testimonials of the sable operator's renovating talents. In the rear rooms lodged together a wood-sawyer and a hardy-sturdy German Jew, the latter being temporarily the boarder of the Knight of the cross and file. The entry had bare walls scored with dirt and charcoal markings, with the plastering gone in many places. The floor was broken and yawned into dangerous cavities looking into the black cellar, and its surface was covered with myriads of gashes from the edges of axes imprinted deeply therein by the occupants who had in common used the planks as a chopping floor for their fire-wood. At about two thirds the length of the passage was a flight of stairs that had lost the centre of gravity and were inclined to tip off into the entry whosoever was so desperate as to ascend them. This inclination had been, however, corrected by a strong prop of timber placed beneath, so that the danger was in a great measure diminished. The ascent however was perilous to the uninitiated who could only achieve it by hugging the wall closely. The middle of each step was deeply worn with the soles of those who had gone up and down in the last eighty years, but as the wood portion was only worn away and the iron nails still remained, forming a sort of knot, the risk of stumbling up or down was very much increased. Nevertheless up and down those stairs, one-sided, and dark as they were, many feet traveled every day. The stairs after descending the half of a circle around a central upright, terminated on the second floor of the tenement in a sort of closet, for entry it could not be called. It was unillumined by any light save what found its way up the stair-way, which in its turn was lighted only by four panes placed above the door, but which were so incrusted with dirt that they were about as serviceable for the purpose for which they were set there, as quares of brown paper. It is true that when the outer door stood open there was a dim radiance pervading the enclosure at the top of the stair-way, at which time it could be seen that there were four sides to it, one being the stair-way and the other in the shape of three doors. One of these doors was nailed up by a board placed securely across it, the other two had latches, one being a little old-fashioned brass knob, the other a catch made of iron. The room on the door of which was the common iron-latch was for the present tenanted by a poet. The door on the left hand which was barred up so forbiddingly was closed for purposes to be hereafter made known. The middle door is the one with which we have to do just now, into which we will enter with the man who has just mounted the stairs and stops before it. He gives a low rap, for the occupant has a peculiar habit of bolting himself in, and the door will, therefore, not yield itself open to the simple turning of the knob with the hand. The individual who has made his appearance at the door is well wrapped in a rich cloak of blue cloth with velvet facings, and wears a modish hat bright with newness. He wears his cloak Spanish fashion over his left shoulder, though as his shoulder wants manly breadth it slips off quite as often as he arranges it upon it; but his persevering efforts to make it hang there are creditable to him. Upon his hands are olive-tinted kid gloves, a very nice fit, and his pantaloons are of the precise olive shade of his gloves, a consideration worthy of remark. His boots were very fashionably made, that is three inches longer and an inch and a half narrower than the foot. The gentleman himself, for having described the more important part of the man first, we now take the lesser, the gentleman himself had a fair skin, a small blue eye, not very expressive, light hair, not brown but olive, nearly the color of his gloves as if his hair had been expressly bespoken to match the gloves and pantaloons, a suggestion quite as reasonable as the visa versa. He had a very strait prim nose, prim chin, thin prim lips, and very erect ears; and altogether was a very prim jobber-looking little man of five and thirty. He rapped a second time a little louder than the first, and then flung the fold of his cloak upon his shoulder again and setting his elbow desperately akimbo to keep it in its place. While he is waiting for the second rap to receive attention we will precede him into the room and see why the first was suffered to pass unheeded. The apartment at the door of which he stands awaiting our leisure as well as that of the occupant, was a large square chamber with a low ceiling, and pannelled walls. It was at a glance a lawyer's office. On one side was ranged upon broken shelves a skeleton of an old law library, and on another hung maps, smoke-browned, and cracked with age. Old candles, boxes, and barrels stood about under the windows or in the corners crammed with papers, old deeds and all the refuse of an ancient law office the accumalations of years. In front of a huge, open-mouthed fire-place that occupied half of the side of the dark, dingy room, stood a square pine table heaped confusedly with law papers, law books, newspapers, cap paper, pens, bottles of ink, sand boxes, wafers, a tobacco-pipe, and a paper of tobacco, a snuff-box upset and the contents half spilled upon an open letter, a broad brimmed greasy hat, an umbrella, a silver-headed cane, and a pair of mittens, a copy of “Tom Paine's Age of Reason” well thumbed, with a pair of spectacles laying upon the open pages, a Bible with a cross pictured upon the cover for Roman Catholics to make oaths upon, a package of writs and another of bail-warrants, an old long expired Policy of Insurance for that very tenement, and a rat-trap with the head and fore-shoulders of an enormous rat firmly secured by the head and shoulders within it! The fourth side of the room was occupied by a turn-up bedstead. By the side of the fire-place was a cupboard containing sundry culinary ware, just sufficient for a bachelor's tenement, which this room evidently was. At the back of the room were arranged boots and shoes of a longer size and unfashionable shape, as if the occupant of the apartment was a man who despised the niceties of wardrobery; and from their soiled appearance he evidently was not a very profitable customer to Kaleb in the premises directly beneath him. The room altogether was a perfect chaos of odds and ends, every thing to be found in it, and nothing in its place. Old hair trunks were here and there gaping with being crammed to surfeiting with old garments and smoky papers mixed together half and half as if packed at a fire. The inmate of the room very plainly was wonderfully independent of Heaven's first law, order! If a book fell from a table it seemed to lay till it was wanted if for months; and if a pane of glass was broken the cavity was stoped securely up with an old hat or waistcoat. The walls were smoked brown, the ceiling was smoked, the books, the papers, were of a smoky hue, and a dark murky atmosphere seemed to pervade the place. There were three chairs in the room; one of them was large, armed, had a high back and was covered with leather, well-glossed from frequent wear. Plainly the owner loved his ease in an arm-chair. He did not, however, take such good care of the ease of his clients, or whosoever his visiters might be, as the chairs were weak brothers, one having a leg gone, the other having a broken back; so that he who sat in the former had to substitute one of his own legs as a supporter of the equilibrium, while the other had to humor the crippled vertebræ with gingerly caution or sit bolt upright. The remaining articles of furniture consisted of a wash-stand containing a battered tin basin, a broken pail half full of water, and a coffee-pot, tea-kettle and toasting fork, placedby the fire-place, in which, under the influence of the breath of a tall, long man down on his knees before them, glowed brightly the embers of a fire in preparation for the evening meal. The personage in question, after blowing at the coals, three in number, for about two minutes, with his large lips within half an inch of them, as glowing as the embers themselves, drew back and taking a book that lay upon the hearth, tore a leaf from it, though loose waste paper lay within his reach, and turning the leaf up into a lighter laid it against the coals and once more applied his lips. A flame rewarded his exertions and placing upon it a few splinters he laid carefully over them a couple of sticks of wood about the bigness of a carpenter's rule and anxiously watched, still on his knees, the gradual progress of ignition. Having thus far accomplished his achievement, he arose from the ashes and hung upon a hook above the fire a venerable-looking tea-kettle, which he had already filled with water. This done, he re-seated himself in his chair and resumed the examination of a volume in yellow-buff calf binding, lettered “Criminal Laws,” which then lay open upon the table. He could now be seen to better advantage than when upon the hearth. He was a tall, angular-jointed man, with a large black head, a low square forehead, much wrinkled and half whiskers which were beginning to show gray. His features were strong, heavy but shrewdly intelligent with a vicious or wicked cast to them. His brows were thick and overtopped his deep set, black eyes something as the low projecting roof of his old tenement overtopped the windows of the second story. His physignomy was so massive that to the ordinary observer he looked dull and sluggish; but the keen looker could detect the most active watchfulness vigilant and covert beneath all. His lips were very prominent and fleshy, but marked with good sense and moreover with sensuality. He wore a snuff-colored coat that looked as if it had been the daily companion to his back for eleven years, and snuff-colored trowsers and snuff-colored cloth vest, all three very much worn and faded, and stained till almost every hue from drab to black was represented in spots upon them. Yet they were whole and substantial and showed not so much poverty of apparel as negligence of costume. In height he was not under six feet, his neck, however, which was very long and scraggy, making up a fair proportion of his height. A narrow fold of white cravat encircled his throat leaving fully exposed Adam's apple,” which was a most formidable protuberance in his thorax. Such was the personal appearance and dress of Simmins Satchell, Esq., Attorney at Law, or rather ex-Attorney, for he was no longer a member of the bar, having been degraded from it some years past for some dishonorable practices. He nevertheless, continued to hover on the verge of the courts, or better to say, to linger in their purlieus. To describe the character and draw a true picture of this man would be to write a history of a life of fraud, dishonor, and criminal transactions, more especially that part of his life which had transpired since his professional degradation. He was one of those “broken-winded and dishonored members of the legal profession,” to be found in all large cities, who are driven to prostitute their talents and learning, no longer available in an honorable way, to the basest of ends, advising for fees the rogue and the swindler, how far they can trespass on the community without making themselves amenable to the laws; and for this purpose carefully digest the criminal laws that they may note and avail themselves of every vantage point for the benefit of each lawless client, if the applicants to a man no longer recognized at the bar as a lawyer, can properly be said to be clients. As he sat leaning back in his arm chair poring over the volume which he held, from time to time he would thrust his big dirty hand, into his thick, short, black hair and rub with great energy the top of his head, a habit peculiar to him when perplexed, and closely thinking. At the same time he would project out his under-lip and purse in his upper, knit his beetle brows and thereby make himself of aspect most hideous. But black and ugly as he looked, he looked intellectual still. His keen bright eye beamed with profound intelligence and sagacity. And to do Simmins Satchell justice he was an able lawyer and well read in his profession. He had the talents and industry that, properly directed and rightly balanced by moral sense, would have placed him, now in his forty-seventh year, upon the bench instead of finding him a despised outlaw from his noble profession, catering to the lowest villanies that dishonor mankind. It is not important to mention here the circumstances which led to his degradation. It is sufficient to say that a natural or educational want of moral honesty was the cause and the secret of his fall. The day was drawing to a close as he sat leaning back in his chair, to catch the light from the low windows with one knee laid over the other. The windows looking into an alley and sunken under the projecting roof, let in little light when the sun got low, and thus it was evening in his room when the sun was shining brightly upon the roof of the town. He was about to turn his book to catch the fire-light, when he heard the rap at his door already alluded to. He laid down the book and prepared to rise to go to the door and admit the comer, when the tea-kettle began to boil. He stopped to remove it from the hook, and in doing so forgot to use a newspaper holder that lay at hand and thereby burned his hand so heavily, that he dashed the kettle to the hearth and ripped out a series of curses that would have done credit to his friend Tom Paine, in his most blasphemous moments. He placed the kettle upon its base again with the dimunition of half its contents, and then the knock being a second time repeated he approached the door and unlocking it, said grumly, “Come in!” And the prim little gentleman in the dapper hat walked in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. THE LEVEE AT SATCHELL'S. The expression of the lawyer's face did not alter upon seeing who his visitor was, so that it could not be guessed whether he were glad or sorry to behold him. His countenance neither bore the bland aspect of a welcome, nor the stern look of repulse. If there was any peculiarity of expression to his dark features, it was a slight ludicrous twist to them, caused by a feeling of lingering pain in the palm of the hand, burned by the hot handle of the tea-kettle. “Good afternoon, or rather good evening, squire,” said the man in the olive-tinted gloves, lifting his hat with an air of respectful consideration, as if his better spirit were awed by the spirit of the lawyer. “You see I am here to my appointment. Always keep punctual time! Punctuality is the greatest human virtue that can adorn humanity in my humble estimation!” “Humph,” ejaculated Satchell, with something like contempt for him. “Sit down, and let me hear what you have done?” And locking the door he returned to his chair, and resting his arm upon the corner of the table and dropping his chin into the hollow of his hand, he fixed his eyes steadfastly upon the delicate red and white cheeks and small pale eyes of the gentleman in olives. “Well, I have found a store,—a capital store! I had not the least difficulty in the world!” “In what street?” “—street, No. 34.” “Who is the landlord?” “Mr. Wells,—Mr. George Wells,” added the speaker, refreshing his memory by glancing at a paper in the top of his hat which rested on his knees. “I know him! He is a good sort of a man for our purpose.” “So I hope. But you are sure there is no danger, squire?” inquired rather anxiously Mr. Peter Pindle, for this was the name of the prim gentleman. “I have closely examined the law, and can assure you there is none whatever. You cannot be touched by a criminal prosecution, that is if you are guided by me in all points.” “That we shall be, sir. We place the utmost confidence in your judgment, sir, and knowledge of the laws. You know if we make ourselves liable it will be a bad job, a very bad job.” “The worst that can come against you will be a civil suit; but I have satisfied your senior partner, Mr. Swindle, on that score.” “Oh, ah, I dare say. If he is satisfied, I am.” “I should suppose so; for Mr. Swindle is a man of experience and sense. I mean no insinuations, Mr. Pindle,” added Satchell, with a sardonic expression about the corners of his mouth. “Oh, not the least, sir—not the least,” answered Mr. Pindle, in a quick, satisfied way. “You seem to have just been about taking tea, hey? Don't let me interrupt you. I can amuse myself till Swindle comes in, looking over your books or the papers. Bless me, what a lot of odds and ends though! I wonder how you find any thing. Now I keep every thing in place. I am called a very neat man, Mr. Satchell. I confess I am something so—a little precise as it were. You see I have the bump of order marvellously large! (Here Mister Pindle raised his fore-finger, and placed it delicately so as not to disturb the nice arrangement of his hair, upon the organ of self-esteem!) It is large you see, squire. The ladies call me a pink, indeed they do! Now do you know, Switchell—” “My name is Satchell, sir,” interrupted the lawyer, who did not seem to be at all noticing him, being busily putting some tea into a tea-pot. “'Pon word, so 'tis. Beg pardon. I do confess I'm forgetful at times. Now do you—” “What time will Mr. Swindle be here?” interrupted the lawyer, snapping him up with a sort of surly growl, something as an old cross mastiff receives the annoyances of a pert puppy. “At seven precise, Mr. Satchell,—'pon word I like to said Switchell!” “And the other parties, are they to be here?” “That I can't positively say; but Swindle knows. He keeps every thing to himself like a Plomatician.” “It is now ten minutes to seven,” said the lawyer, looking at a large silver watch that lay upon the table, with a long steel chain and smooth gold seal appended. “Prezactly, Mr. Satchell,” repeated Mister Pindle, taking from his vest pocket a very small ladies' gold lepine, and looking at it with an air and in a way to make the most display of it. “'Pon word, you must find it exceedingly dull living here alone; do your own cooking too!” “My housekeeping suits me, Mr. Pindle,” responded Satchell, sticking a piece of bread upon a fork and setting it down to the fire, before which he had previously put his tea to steep on a few coals. “I am a plain liver, and a plain eater.” “But it's so odd! People say you are so rich too! But it looks awfully poor to live so!” Here the precise pinky gentleman looked about the room, and then rested his eyes upon the culinary operations with a slight shudder of delicate abhorrence. The lawyer having toasted his bread very deliberately, quite as deliberately as if his visitor had been a shadow, and made his tea, poured out a cup of it, to which he added milk and brown sugar from a pewter bowl, and pitcher which he took from the cupboard over the mantel-piece. He then buttered his toast, and with a piece of smoked herring as a relish, proceeded very composedly to eat his supper on the corner of his table, his cup resting on Chitty's Pleadings, his saucer on a copy of the Revised Statues, and his plate upon the open volume of the Records of the Court of Sessions, while his sugar bowl and cream-pot found a clear place of the table for their accommodation. Mr. Satchell ate and Mister Peter Pindle gazed in silence, as if he thought it dangerous to interrupt the lion at his food. At length, the lawyer rose up, after having drank four cups of tea, eaten four slices of toast, and consumed a herring and a half, bones and all, greatly to the amazement and curiosity of his spectator, who, with his feet placed sharp up to supply the want of a fourth leg to the chair, and his body bending forward, never took his eyes from him until he had done. The lawyer rose up to put away his dishes and light his pipe, which when he had done it and re-seated himself, he began to smoke with an air of the most enviable composure and utter contempt of the presence of Mr. Peter Pindle, thereby showing that he was a very independent man, or else that Mr. Peter Pindle, spite of his olive-tinted gloves and pants and blue cloak, dapper hat and fashionable toed boots, was nobody. And Mr. Prindle was not much of any body. His history up to this time can be told in a few sentences. He was the son of a tallow chandler in a thriving town not far from Plymouth Rock, and being by nature of a fair complexion and delicate personal appearance, he had been put behind a man-milliner's store, to sell tape, silk ribbons, and other articles usually sold by females. If possible his occupation rendered him still more effeminate than before.— Finally, he got to be a junior partner in a retail thread and needle store, and being smart, ambitious, and wholly destitute of principle, using truth and falsehood indiscriminately, just as they would serve his purpose, he made money and got credit. By and by his partner died, and he took into copartnership a fashionable dry goods dealer, and combined the two kinds of business. In a year or two he dropped the thread and needle part of the business, and moving into a fashionable store, devoted himself to the retail dry goods selling. His credit increased. He filled the papers with his long, flashy advertisement, till Peter Pindle's name, though he was but a dapper, kid-glove little man, made a great show and as often met the eyes as Brandreth's. But Mr. Pindle lived very expensively, boarding at the most stylish hotel, and spending money very lavishly upon enjoyments. He got into debt, and times becoming hard, even so that fashionable ladies saved their money and let their last fashions go another season; he was forced to close his mahogany doors and plate-glass windows, the landlord placing upon them a placard, “To Let.” Mr. Pindle, however, was still Mr. Pindle, though he was in debt and could not pay twenty cents in the dollar. He succeeded in getting credit again and stocking anew, and in six months sold out “at cost,” and failed a second time. It was impossible for him to get credit again, though he had impudence enough to try it. He was known and marked. He at length left his hotel and took lodgings less conspicuous, and his circumstances growing desperate, he began to cast about in his mind how he should retrieve his circumstances. There chanced to board at the same house with him a broken speculator by the name of Swindle, a man about forty years of age, who had been at one time in his life worth a hundred thousand dollars, but now was in debt for his last quarter's board, without means to meet it. There is always a secret sympathy and instinctive understanding between the minds of unprincipled men, even before they speak with each other. They seem at a glance to measure one another, and to recognize a likeness to themselves. Pindle had not been three days in his new quarters when he saw that Swindle was a man after his own heart; and Swindle saw that Pindle was quite as desperate a character as himself. The two men came together naturally without introduction, and soon formed an intimacy based upon similarity of characters, condition, and hopes. The result of their growing amity was a determination to combine in some way so as to bring about a change in their circumstances for the better. Mr. Swindle was a cautious man. He did not wish to commit himself so as to be amenable to the law. He wished to retain the outward form of a character, however he might be destitute of its substance. He wished to act in whatever he did so that the law could not take hold of him. He impressed his friend Pindle with the cautious action. “Now what can we do, Swindle?” said Pindle, after they had so far interchanged sentiments as to understand that each were prepared to do any thing however fraudulent, provided they could steer within the letter of the law. “Something must be done; I am run dry; I have not twenty dollars in the world, and this suit of clothes shabby enough. You have not but the two dollars I lent you this morning; though your clothes are more decent than mine. I am ready to do any thing!” “Suppose we consult Satchell,” observed Swindle. “And who is Satchell, pray?” asked Pindle. “Softly—don't talk quite so loud,” said Mr. Swindle; “we must be cautious, for I would not like to be overheard. The partitions are there, and key-holes are made expressly to convey sounds to listeners' ears.” This conversation took place in Mr. Swindle's room, a small upper chamber in a fourth rate boarding house in Court Street, over a confectioner's, where they boarded. “Satchell is a lawyer who was once one of the most talented members of the bar, but he was degraded, I believe for a forgery, and imprisoned a year, and now devotes his talents to giving advice to rogues!” “But we are not rogues, dear Swindle,” remarked Pindle, looking very virtuous. “I am a gentleman, sir.” “Very well, you are a gentleman; I am willing. Satchell is a man who knows every crook and turn of the criminal law, and just how far to a hair a man can encroach upon it, without incurring its penalties. I know some men he has done service to, and the more I think of it the more I am satisfied he is the man to see, before we do any thing.” “But what are you thinking of doing?” “Of establishing a house and going into business.” “Without capital?” “Yes.” “Without credit?” “Yes.” “'Pon word, I don't understand it,” exclaimed Mr. Pindle, with very great amazement manifested on his inexpressive pink and white face. “Well, you shall know if you will call with me on Satchell.” The visit was paid to Mr. “Rogues' Lawyer,” and advice given accordingly by the unconscientious Satchell. This interview took place about ten days prior to the opening of this story, and in the interval affairs had been progressing to a point from which bold and resolute action was to begin. The nature of the business, and the character of the others engaged in it besides Swindle and Pindle, will be revealed by the interview now about to occur between all the parties in Satchell's office, Pindle being the first comer. Satchell having, as we have seen, completed his supper and taken his pipe, had not smoked but a few minutes before a person was heard stumbling up the stairs. “That is Swindle,” said Pindle, jumping up and going to the loor. “Don't be in a hurry, Mr. Pindle,” cried the lawyer; “I can let in my own visiters.” Mr. Pindle slunk back, coloring, and the attorney turning the key looked carefully before opening the door. He then admitted a stout built man, about five feet and a half high, with a full, red face, and a look of respectability. He took off his hat, and exhibited a round bald head shining like glass. His eyes were small hazel orbs that sparkled with a quick, lively light, yet the expression of his face was shrinking and hidden, as if he feared to trust his countenance too freely to be the index of his soul. He wore a brown surtout and a white beaver hat, and carried an India cane. His appearance altogether was that of a middle-aged commercial gentlemen, of a fair reputation and independent circumstances. It was, however, no other than James Swindle, who had not a dollar of his own on earth, and whose reputation was worthless, except in roguedom, where it stood high. Like Satchell in law, he had in the mercantile world been dishonored, and now used his commercial talents and experience to further the basest of frauds. “Ah, Mr. Swindle,” said Satchell; “glad to see you!” but the lawyer did not shake hands with him, for it was Satchell's principle never to shake hands with any body. “I am here in time,” said Mr. Swindle, looking round to see who was there. “Ah, Mr. Pindle, so you are on the spot!” “Yes, sir, always punctual,” answered Pindle, in his usual flippant, quick, self-satisfied way; for Pindle was a most self-approving individual, for such a thorough faced rogue as he was. It is not certain whether Pindle was villain enough to commit a murder. It is likely he would have failed in the courage to do such a deed. But all other crimes less than murder he was ready to do, so that he could escape the law. For such a delicate complexioned gentleman, he was quite as great a villain as Satchell. In fact, the three men were very well matched in the internals, though in externals they appeared like very opposite sort of persons, and such as would not be likely to have any interests in common. By and by other knocks were heard at the door, and in less than a quarter of an hour after Mr. Swindle's entrance Satchell admitted into his dark den seven other persons of various sizes, ages, and dress, but all one in roguery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. THE COMBINATORS IN CONCLAVE. The visitors whom Satchell admitted one after the other, stumbled about as well as they could in the dark office to find seats,— some of them occupying barrels and boxes and others such places as they could avail themselves of. The office was by this time nearly wrapped in darkness, for the day had closed; a faint flicker light from the fire only cast its uncertain radiance upon the faces and forms of the singularly disposed group. After they were seated, Satchell lighted a tallow candle and after deliberately sticking it into the neck of an ink-bottle, resumed his seat in the leathern arm chair. He then gazed round upon his visitors with a scorching glance from beneath his pent-house brows. They all sat awaiting his pleasure to speak. The last comers looked like fair-dealing citizens of the town, so far as dress and appearance went, being neatly appareled, clean shaved and genteel. “Well, gentlemen,” said Satchell, thrusting out his under lip in quite an august way, “we are all assembled, I believe.” “Yes, sir, we are all here,” responded Mr. Pindle. “Very well. Now as this meeting will be our last before we go into operation, all the matters should be thoroughly discussed and understood.” “Yes, sir, they should be, Mr. Satchell,” responded a heavy man, with a deep baritone voice, and an enormous nose. “We must have all the law clear; we can't run risks and then be found in the wrong.” “No; we put our whole faith in you, Squire Satchell,” called out a squeaking, thin, violin voice, from a slender gentleman in spectacles, who was seated upon the edge of a barrel, and seemed rather uneasy on his seat too; “we pay you and you must protect us.” “True, Mr. Satchell, Mr. Haul speaks truly,” said a man in a camblet wrapper, who looked half gone in consumption, and who coughed with a painful hollow sound at every third word. “We have all the risks to run, while you receive sure profits and without any capital.” “Talking of capital, gentlemen,” responded the lawyer, with a sardonic smile, “I think we are pretty much upon an equality. I have closely examined into the criminal law governing the crime of obtaining goods under false and fictitious pretences, and I can assure you that in the enterprise you contemplate you run no risk whatsoever.” “So that we keep within the pale of the criminal law,” said Mr. Swindle, “we care not a snap of the finger for civil tribunals.” “Yes, that is the general sentiment,” said a young man about three and twenty, with a very keen gray eye, and a small thin mouth, always pursed up, as if he were playing at cards and was hesitating whether to play his trump card or trust his partner. He was dressed in a blue frock coat buttoned to the chin, a black stock, and a Panama hat; for it was early in the month of October,—a time when the summer gear struggles to hold out against the innovations of Winter's costume, especially with individuals like the young gentlemen in question, whose purses are as light as their pants. “Yes, that is all we care for,” responded the heavy man with the base voice. “Keep us out of the clutches of the criminal law, and we'll laugh at a civil prosecution.” “That is my intention, gentlemen,” responded Satchell. “I have here written out a digest of the records of all cases parellel to the present matter. I have carefully dissected and analyzed them, submitting them to the severest test. No vantage point has escaped my scrutiny. If you will listen, I will read to you the result.” Here Mr. Satchell from three or four pages of closely written manuscript read an abstract of all the reports of cases for obtaining fraudulently the property of others. He also read notes of his own appended, showing by what means each particular statute could be evaded with safety. This reading was listened to with marked attention, and seemed to be received with very decided approbation by the gentlemen present. “Now you see, gentlemen, just how far you can go and yet keep within the law. It depends now on yourselves to go forward and make a profitable business operation together. Are you ready to proceed to action? Mr. Pindle informs me that he has hired a suitable store—” Before a reply could be given, the company were electrified by a sudden burst of eloquent recitation proceeding from the room on the right. The speaker's voice was elevated in a sort of triumphant ecstasy. What he said could be distinguished plainly, being enunciated in the true vein heroic: “Oh, what can compare To the beautious hair, That flows in tresses wild About the brow Of Parian snow Of Beauty's lovely child? Tell me, ye gods, oh tell! The secret charm that throws Such a bewildering spell As in each ringlet flows? 'Tis the priceless Oil of Lil, For sale by Mr. Rowland Hill! Fifty cents a box will buy! Pretty maiden, will you try? It will make your tresses shine, And your beauty be divine!” “'Pon honor! what can all that mean?” ejaculated Mr. Pindle, who with the rest of the company had been listening with amazement. “It will do!” continued the voice. “By the immortal Hercules, it will do! It is worth two cents a line if it is worth one.” “That is a poetical gentleman, who calls himself Mr. Frederick Byron Rhymewell,” said Mr. Satchell, with a smile. “He has lately taken that room, and is doubtless a very harmless person. So don't look as if you had been overheard plotting a conspiracy. Be assured if he hears us he thinks of nothing but his doggrel rhyme, which he makes at so much a line for the shopdealers to stick in the newspapers.” “He seems to be a very noisy individual, sir,” said the stout gentleman with the basson voice, resuming his seat upon the edge of a box, from which the sudden voice had started him. “We must talk lower, gentlemen.” Some few low murmurings were still heard from the poet's room, as if he was buzzing over his copy and correcting it for the press. “I asked you, gentlemen, if you were ready to commence operations?” observed the lawyer, once more calling their attention to the matter before them. “Yes, I believe we are,” replied Mr. Swindle, who seemed to have a certain importance and weight of character among them.— “Pindle has the store, he says. Where is it?” “No. 34, — Street. I hire from Mr. George Wells, the shipping merchant.” “I know him. He will do.” “So I told him,” answered Satchell. “Now I wish you to detail to me your plan, as I have laid down the law. I can then judge whether it can be carried out safely.” “Our plan is this,” responded Mr. Swindle, in a low tone, so as not to be overheard by the poet in the adjoining room, “and in stating it there need be no mincing of words between us; for we know one another. Without money, without means, without character, and without friends, we have combined together to rob the public, but to rob so as to evade justice. These are the two great points of our operations. For this we are bound together in u solemn compact. We have not always been what we are now, but circumstances have driven us to this course. We are men whose minds have become so perverted that we cannot follow even if we could find any honest occupation. There is not one who hears me that could be honest a month. You see I speak plainly. We are assembled here, a set of desperate spirits in combination, to cheat, defraud, plunder an unsuspecting community. We are united by the same interests. We have sworn to the same compact. I will now, as I promised at our last meeting, lay before you my plan of operations then hinted to you. It is as follows.” Here the members of the “combination” drew closer together so as to be nearer the speaker, and all listened with intense attention. 2 “In the first place, I propose, as I did on that occasion, that we select a fictitious firm as the basis of our operations.” “That is already chosen,” said Mr. Pindle. “Swindle, Pindle &amp; Co.” “Yes, unless the gentlemen present prefer another,” observed Mr. Swindle, bowing round blandly. “I see no necessity of another,” remarked the lawyer. “None whatever. We could not have a better house, or better men for the operation,” answered several voices, among which was heard the baritone of the heavy gentleman. “Such being your pleasure, my friends,” resumed Mr. Swindle, “I am ready to perform my part to the best of my abilities. A firm being chosen and a counting-room being obtained, this is the mode of proceeding that I submit. The first thing is for us to engage a carpenter, painter, and upholsterer to fit up the counting-room in a very splendid style, to attract the eye and give an idea of capital at the bottom. We shall then employ a printer to get up a very showy, neat card, stating our business, &amp;c., `Swindle, Pindle &amp; Co., Commission Merchants, and Land and Real Estate Brokers.' We must then send our card to a stationer, and get him to send us all the stationery, books, &amp;c., that we want. Upon our card will be the references to my friends here, who will have offices similarly fitted up in other parts of the city, or else hire a desk in some large counting-room. Swindle, Pindle &amp; Co. will refer the stationer to Breter, Freter &amp; Co.,” added the speaker, bowing to the heavy gentleman and the slim gentleman, to designate them; “and also to Charles Caregee &amp; Co., who will also have a handsome place of business, and honor our references!” here he bowed to the consumptive gentleman in the camblet wrapper. “Thus we will establish a firm and references, gentlemen, and then prepare to make our purchases.” “Do you mean to put your own names upon the business card as the head firm?” asked the lawyer. “If you do, you will be liable.” “I so understand you, Mr. Satchell.” “No, you would then be amenable in all your subsequent operations to the law. The law would know where to find its men. No, no, that won't do. And besides, you and Pindle are too well known, for persons to place any confidence in you. You must choose a fictitious name for your firm. The firm should be composed of nobodies, while the references should be real.” “I see now my error, sir,” answered Mr. Swindle. “You are correct. Let me hear what further suggestions you can make; for now you have an outline of my project, and can with your shrewdness no doubt improve upon it.” “I think I can. You propose to go into business as a Commission House, with no other capital than the references to your copartners here present, who will, like you, have offices, where they will satisfy in the most favorable manner all persons who inquire about you.” “Yes.” “Very well; then this is your plan. But I shall charge you one hundred dollars more for suggesting it.” “You shall have it,” answered the three gentlemen in specs. “Out of your first gains?” “Yes,” answered Mr. Swindle, somewhat reluctantly. “If, then, you would make all secure, you will follow my directions closely, and I will guaranty you a profitable and safe business. Hire first your counting-room, and get your carpenters, painters, and upholsterers to fit it up in the style you proposed, and let them call for their pay some other day, for the excuse that much money to pay out just in starting will be accepted by them, and they will wait—till they get it. Your stationer will trust you on seeing your card and references, which you will send to him, but he will first go and give you a call to look round, and perhaps call on one of your referees, who must be ready to satisfy him of your goodness and substantiality. The name on your card, instead of being your own may be Moonshine, Clouds &amp; Co., which is as good as any thing. Your references must be real names, such as are here present. In the offices of the referees there need not be so much to meet the eye, but merely a show of business, desks, maps hung round, old ledgers piled up, and a sort of busy confusion of humbugery about.” “But, sir, what am I to do?” inquired Mr. Pindle. “You and Mr. Swindle are to be in the counting-room of course. He, from his respectable air and mercantile gravity of countenance, will be there as clerk of the firm, to receive callers, buyers or purchasers. You will be the out-doors man to make purchases and bring business to the house, for which you are very well fitted. Mr. Swindle will be in the counting-room, always ready to receive merchandize and packages of goods which you order to be sent to your firm, that is the firm of Moonshine, Clouds &amp; Co., to which you are of course only an out-door clerk. It will be important, of course, Mr. Pindle, that you transact business with merchants who do not know you.” “Of course, sir, that is understood.” “It should be, sir,” resumed the lawyer and master spirit of this conclave of rogues. “It would be very unfortunate for you to appear at all busy in the presence of those who have had experience of your business affairs. Keep out of their way and out of their line, which is the wholesale dry goods. Your business in the present enterprise must lie entirely with a different class of merchants, and in different streets from your old haunts. All will be new and clear before you. The articles you will deal in will be principally such articles as are afloat in the market, and pass from purchaser to purchaser without moving from the original storage, copper, hides, wool, cochineal, gunny-bags, tea, coffee, raisins, Mediterranean and Brazilian goods, &amp;c.. You will proceed in all your operations with the confidence and boldness of men who have large monied capital, and who intend to pay cash on delivery.” “But how would you chalk out a single operation, sir, as a model specimen?” asked Mr. Swindle, with a look of deference to the knowledge and sagacity of the lawyer. “In this way. You have, suppose, all ready in the counting-room, your cards prepared and yourselves also. You have your referees at their desks, wherever that may be, and prepared to satisfy all inquisitive persons.” “Very well, so far, so good,” remarked Mr. Pindle, kicking his feet delightedly against the sides of the barrel. “Now to the particulars.” “Oh, Rose, coal brack Rose! I hope I may be scotch'd If I don't lub Rose!” “'Pon honor!” exclaimed Mr. Pindle, at this sudden outburst of negro melody from the boot-black's premises underneath. “What is that?” “Yes, what in the d—l is that?” demanded the heavy gentleman, in a tone of surprise. “You have odd lodgers, Mr. Satchell!” “That is black Handy, who rents a room below,” answered Satchell, dryly. “He always sings that particular song when he begins to black up his boots. You can't stop him. If he don't sing he can't polish. I've got quite used to him, gentlemen.” “'Pon honor,” ejaculated Mr. Pindle, as Handy's voice rose in volume and melody, “I think he must suppose we love his Rose too!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. THE CONCLAVE. The boot-black had not been singing more than two-thirds of a minute, when a second voice was heard from the room beneath the poet's. It was that of Kaleb Kemp, the cobbler. It was shrill and broken, and by no means had that volume of melody that Handy poured forth from his lungs. The words of Mr. Kemp's song reached the amazed ears of the conclave:— “Old King Cole was a merry old soul, And a merry old soul was he; He wore an old coat with one button-hole, And buckles all down at the knee!” Then, by way of a rapping chorus, the little cobbler began to play a lively rap-a-tap in turn upon lap-stone. “Bless me!” ejaculated the heavy gentleman; “you seem to have a merry set of lodgers!” “And confounded noisy,” observed the thin gentleman in spectacles, very positively. “And as independent as emperors,” remarked Mr. Swindle, with a confirmatory emphasis. “I don't see, 'pon honor, how you live here, Satchell,” suggested Mr. Pindle, as Handy, not to be outdone by the cobbler, his neighbor, struck up the next verse of his song in a louder key. “They pay me rent, gentlemen; and one will, you know, put up with a great many things for money. I can't rent my house, except to such people; and, to tell you the truth, I have no objections to a little vocal music now and then.” “You are fond of poetry, I presume, too,” sarcastically observed the consumptive gentleman, after a severe spasm of coughing, in a tone so hollow that he seemed to be coughing into the mouth of a hogshead. This remark was elicited by another outburst from the poet in the adjoining chamber:— “O, all ye crooked, twisted men, If ye would be like Greek Adonis, Haste to Tompkins', No. Ten, The only fitter that in town is, And he will make you coat and pants Fit for a wedding or a dance; Every lady will admire, And for your hand at once aspire—” Here the combined lungs of the cobbler and Handy drowned the poet's less vigorous voice, and for a moment it seemed as if the “conclave” in the lawyer's room would break up in confusion. Satchell saw this, and stamped with his feet upon the floor to silence the boot-black, and, rising, knocked upon the partition to stop the heroic recitations of the poet. The cobbler, however, being beyond the influence of his landlord's authority, kept still on with his scraps of songs, interlarded with hammering upon his lap-stone, but not to the interruption of the business of the meeting. “Now, gentlemen, if you will listen to me, I will finish what I was saying,” observed the lawyer. “All your arrangements made as I have said, one of you—Mr. Pindle, for instance—will start forth on a sunny morning to see who wants to sell. You must seek some new firm, Mr. Pindle; for new firms are more anxious to sell than old ones, are less likely to suspect, and are less keen at a bargain than your old establishments. Generally, you will find them over-solicitous to make a trade, and will be satisfied if your references say you are good, though they never saw either of their faces before. An old firm will generally require references from references, until they follow the scent up to some persons they well know are responsible. You will therefore seek out a new firm.” “Yes, sir,” answered Mr. Pindle, who was listening with the greatest attention, as also were the rest. “But this would not have occurred to me! What a confounded long head you have, Mr. Satchell!” Mr. Satchell did not seem to be particularly moved by this compliment to the shrewdness of his roguery, and thus resumed:— “When you have fixed your eye upon such a firm, green and over-anxious to sell, you go in with a bold face, and walk up to the desk with the air of a man who has ten thousand dollars in his pocket-book to buy with. You will pass the compliments of the day, such as a cheerful `Good day, sir! how do you do, sir?' If he answers you in the same way, you will immediately proceed to business, saying, `Sir, I see, by the morning's paper, that you have on sale fifteen barrels tapioca, and twenty baskets. We have just had an order for twelve barrels, which we must fill up forthwith. What is your price?' `We have the article,' your merchant will reply. `Should be glad to sell you. Our terms, cash, or approved paper at sixty days, or ninety, as the case may be. You shall have it cheaper than you can get it elsewhere in the market.' You will then, having heard his price, Mr. Pindle, reply, that you are perfectly satisfied, and at once tell him that you will take twelve barrels, ordering him to send it to your store without delay. Then you will hand him your card in an off-hand manner, saying, `Here is our house-card, sir, and, as you see, with the most satisfactory references.' The splendid card, with the firm of Moonshine, Clouds &amp; Co., with the respectable array of names as references, will dazzle his eye. You then bow very politely, but hurriedly, and, as you go out, you see some boxes of raisins and drums of figs. You ask the price, and order fifty of one and seventy of the other to be sent also; for `you recollect that you were desired to purchase if you could find any fresh.' “You will then take your departure, leaving the merchant congratulating himself, and rubbing his hands together with satisfaction at having got such a capital customer, and made such a prompt and profitable sale of his merchandize. Let us imagine the scene. A smile is upon his face, and he looks round upon his clerks like a man who has drawn a prize in a lottery. `John!' he calls to his confidential clerk. `Sir!' `Do you know any of these referees?' `No, I do not, sir, but I dare say they are good. They look so.' `Yes. Take your hat, and call upon one or two of them.' `Yes, sir.' We now suppose our heavy friend here, with the bass voice, is at his desk when John comes in. `Good morning, sir,' says John, favorably impressed with the business-like air of the counting-room, and still more favorably with the respectable appearance of our friend here, who at once understands what his visitor wants. `Good morning, sir!' he responds, blandly; `a fine day, sir.' `Yes, sir. Here is a card, sir,' observes the clerk, `which bears your firm as a reference.' And he politely lays it before our copartner. `All correct, sir. Messrs. Moonshine, Clouds &amp; Co. are rather a new house, but perfectly good. You see by my books,' (for books are to be presumed to show,) `that I have sold them thousands of dollars' worth on credit and cash. I am ready to do it again, to any amount they want.' This is said to the clerk in a very imposing decided way, calculated to impress. The clerk bows, is satisfied, takes his leave, and returns to the firm which sent him, which we will call, for distinctness' sake, `Green &amp; Shallow.' `Perfectly satisfactory,' answers the clerk to the inquiring eye of Mr. Shallow, as he enters the counting-room. `They showed me their books where they had sold this firm hundreds and hundreds of dollars' worth, both on cash and credit. They said they were ready to do it again, and to any amount they might want. He says there are not more punctual men in town, sir.' “`Then, as all is right,' says Mr. Green, looking at Mr. Shallow, `we will send the articles round at once. Michael!' he calls out to his handcartman, `call a dray to take the raisins and figs, while you load up with the tapioca; and have the goods all taken at once to the counting-house of Messrs. Moonshine, Clouds &amp; Co.' “In the mean while,” resumed the lawyer to his listening auditors, “we will suppose that, while the clerk went to see our heavy friend here, Mr. Shallow, the junior partner, dropped in at the counting-house of Moonshine &amp; Co., to look about. Appearances are satisfactory, very; and he returns, and so has reported to the senior, before the clerk comes back with his glowing account. Well, the articles are all sent off on drays and in handcart to the place of business of the purchasers.” “And now comes the rub, sir,” observed Mr. Swindle, who had listened with admiration to the process of proceeding thus far. “You ought to have been a merchant, Mr. Satchell. But I have some curiosity to know how you are going to get the articles into our possession; for, of course, the bill will be at once sent with them.” “You will find that it will take a lawyer to get along with the affair at this crisis,” answered Mr. Satchell, with a secret smile of conscious power. “Listen, gentlemen; for I wish to detail perfectly to your understanding the whole plan of action by which, in less than twenty-four hours after you commence business, you will be able to retire with very handsome profits.” There was a general movement to get a little nigher the speaker, and ears were bent with the closest attention. “Mr. Pindle having done his part of the business, that is, the purchasing part, Mr. Swindle will now be ready to act. His appearance—very respectable and grave, as you see, gentlemen— will be all in his favor.” Here there was a spontaneous leveling of the eyes at the person of Mr. Swindle, and apparently with approval. Mr. Swindle withstood the inspection with that modesty which was one of his remarkable characteristics. “The drays arrive at the counting-room door of Moonshine, Clouds &amp; Co. The clerk, John, enters at the same moment, with the bill of articles, receipted; the amount some three thousand dollars, which he expects in five minutes to find represented in his pocket by a check on a bank in State street. He enters, and glances round for Mr. Pindle, the only one of the firm he has ever seen, and who, as he had been given to understand by Mr. Pindle, represented the `Co.' of the firm. But Mr. Pindle, at this particular moment, is not in. But he sees Mr. Swindle, and, supposing him, from his respectable appearance and gray hairs, to be the senior partner, he approaches him, and suggests, very politely, that he probably has the pleasure of addressing Mr. Moonshine, or Mr. Clouds. Mr. Swindle replies, with a slight blush, that he has not the honor of being either of those distinguished gentlemen; that his position is only a clerk. Mr. John stares, but is confirmed in the stability of a house that has such respectable clerks as Mr. Swindle. If the clerk is such a weighty-looking personage, what must be the principals? He now inquires where the firm is, and when they will either of them be in; and, having seen Mr. Pindle already, he asks particularly for that gentleman. “`The firm are out,' responds Mr. Swindle, `and will be in in the afternoon, or certainly in the morning before bank hours. If you have any business, leave it with me, or call to-morrow.' “`I have here the bill of the tapioca, raisins, and figs, which your Mr. Pindle bought of our house, and the articles are delivered at the door. Did he leave any instructions for you to settle it?' “`No, he did not. He will, however, be in himself before long. You had best wait,' answers Mr. Swindle, offering him a chair; `or, if you will call again in an hour, you will be sure to find him in.' “The goods, in the mean while,” resumed the lawyer, are unladed from the drays, and placed on the sidewalk. The clerk, having no suspicion whatever, and not caring to wait, goes away, with the intention of returning in an hour. The articles he will leave behind, of course. He is no sooner out of sight with the drays, than Pindle makes his appearance out of the safe-closet, and immediately orders a new set of drays, piles on the articles, and hurries them off to an auction-room, or to some dealer who will buy at once, and turns them into cash. This operation you will perform as many times in the day you open for business as possible; and, if you are industrious, and faithful, and fortunate, you ought to make at least forty thousand dollars by a single day's operation. You can then vacate your places of business, and come here and share your spoils. Now, gentlemen, you have the outline of my plan,” concluded the lawyer, “and I submit it to your decision.” “There could be none better—none better!” exclaimed the conclave of rogues, unanimously. “You deserve to be the prince of swindledom!” cried Pindle, with exultation. “We can see with half an eye, from our experience in business, that your plan will be easily carried out. What a capital business man has been spoiled in your becoming a lawyer!” “You have shown great skill and depth, I must confess,” said Swindle. “The whole plan seems to promise the most perfect success.” “I can make at least a dozen such operations in a day,” answered Pindle. “'Pon honor, Satchell, you deserve a vote of thanks! I rise, gentlemen, to propose —” “Wait, Pindle!” cried the heavy gentleman; “wait till we succeed. There is time enough then. I want to be sure that these operations won't involve us, and get some of us into prison. There is none of us here that cares a fig for a civil suit for debt; for, as we have no characters to lose, nor money either, we can laugh at such suits. Those who sue will have to pay the costs. But I feel ticklish about the criminal law. Can you make us sure on that point, Mr. Satchell?” “Perfectly, sir. The statute I have discussed and examined closely. You can go into this operation with perfect security that the law can't touch you. You may buy for cash on delivery, or in any other manner that will enable you to get possession of your goods, without any fears. When once they are in your hands, and are immediately carted off to some unknown quarter, they can't of course trace them and get them back. They will then resort to a civil suit, if they can find you, or perhaps a criminal one for obtaining goods on false pretences. Neither of these, however, will be of any avail. The former will only add to their `profit and loss.' The latter, I assure you, gentlemen, has failed in every instance where such rogues as you are—no offence meant—have been criminally arraigned; for you are not the first gentlemen whom I have advised legally in such operations. You go to the District Attorney, and he will tell you—at least, he will tell your victims—that he cannot convict. Thus, if you see fit to stand the suit, you can do so, and keep open your counting-rooms after the first day, and do your best to make further `operations' upon those who do not know you. But there is some risk that your firm may be warned against in the papers, by an advertisement signed by your victims; so I would advise you, if your first day's operations prove profitable, that you close the concern the same night, leaving your desks, &amp;c. to the carpenters and upholsterers who loaned them. Now, gentlemen, it remains with you to go forward and bring my plans into action.” “And that we shall do at once,” answered Mr. Swindle. After some further conversation and discussion of the minor points of preparation, the conclave broke up and retired, to commence operations on the ensuing day.[1] [1] In these chapters, we have laid open actual transactions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. THE POET. When the lawyer was left alone he snuffed his candle and threw himself back in his chair with an air of very decided satisfaction. “I shall make a thousand dollars at the least by this affair,” he said aloud. “They run all the risk and have the whole trouble, while I only give my advice. I have the utmost confidence in the whole plan. Swindle and Pindle are both the right sort of men. They will carry it through.” He was interrupted in his meditations by a low, timid knock at his door. “Another visitor! It is past nine o'clock. I wonder who it can be?” He rose and went to the door, but did not unlock it, but demanded who was there? “It is me, Mr. Satchell,” answered a soft voice. “Who is me?” “Byron!” simpered the lips without. “Oh, my poet, hey!” answered Satchell, unlocking the door and letting him in. The visitor was a very slender, pale-faced young gentleman, with very long light hair, very much tangled, very large wandering blue eyes, and no beard. He was dressed very shabbily in a black coat out at the elbows, shrunken up trowsers, a vest double-breasted pinned for want of buttons close up to his throat, which was encircled by a seedy black handkerchief. He looked altogether like a young gentleman in distress, and had an air at once meek and proud, —the pride of conscious genius struggling with conscious poverty. His hair was brushed back from his high forehead, and a pen behind the right ear protruded itself through the uncombed locks. “Good even Sare,” said the poet, bowing very politely, and looking at the same time very grave, “I have taken the liberty to intrude upon you, Sir, to solicit the honor of the loan of about half an inch of candle!” “What do you want with candle?” asked Mr. Satchell with a smile of curiosity. “Why, Sare, I am exceedingly mortified to have to make this request of you, but I have been penning an ode and had just finished all but seven lines when as the fates would have it, my candle expired very suddenly and mysteriously in the socket, and I was left in Hadean darkness. It is important Sare, that the ode should be completed to night, as it must be taken to the printers to appear, without fail in the morning's paper! So you perceive, Sare, the infinite importance of my request for the loan, temporarily of half an inch of candle!” Here Mr. Frederick Byron Rhymewell bowed with great gravity and courtesy. “Come in and finish your ode, Mr. Rhymewall at my candle, if you have a mind to. I am sorry to say that this is my last one!” “Sare, you are exceedingly polite. I would avail myself of your very handsome offer, but really Sare, there are certain difficulties that attend genius, which perhaps, Sare, you may not properly appreciate! Will you believe it, Mr. Satchell I cannot compose a line unless I have my own ink-stand before me and papers and the things I am used to, and then my face must be towards the same corner of the room!” “Indeed, well then I will take my candle into your room and wait until you complete your ode!” “I am grateful, Sare, for your condescension!” “Not at all,” answered the lawyer taking his light and following the poet into his own room. This was an apartment about eight feet square and wholly destitute of furniture, save a wretched little table, a chair to match, and a dingy mattrass rolled up in the corner. The rest was bare floor and bare walls. It was lighted by day by a single window, which had fewer panes of glass than shingle and rag panes. Upon the table was a cork ink-stand, a few sheets of browny-white cap-paper, a pen worn to the stump, and a rhyming dictionary very much dog-leafed and thumb-worn. A scrap-book lay, also, upon the table, containing the various printed poems and odes which Mr. Frederick Byron Rhyme well had written for the newspapers at the order of shop-keepers, at a penny a line. “Be seated, Mr. Satchell,” said the poet, handing him the only chair.” “No, I can stand!” “By no means, Sare! I insist! I can write my poem upon one knee! I often do!” Here he placed the chair, broken at the back and half its seat whittled away with a penknife, for his landlord to sit in, while he dropped gracefully upon one knee before his table, where he had placed the light, seized his pen, dipped it in the ink, and then elevated his chin and eyes to a dimly seen dark spot in the corner of the ceiling, and seemed all at once to forget that he was not alone. In an instant he was lost in the world of abstraction. Suddenly he started as if he had been electrified and dashed the words of inspiration off upon his paper with the speed of thought. It was like the race of Pegasus. The ink flew in spatters as gravel might be supposed to fly from the hoofs of Pegasus. In an instant one line was penned and up went chin and eyes in “fine phrenzy rolling” in search of another line in the dingy spot in the corner. At length it was seized and penned down upon the paper, below the other. Five more lines followed in rapid succession, and with a tremendous flourish of the last word, Mr. Rhymewell triumphantly exclaimed, “It is done! a quarter earned in two hours and a half!” “You seem to be pursuing quite a profitable business of it,” observed the lawyer, who had silently awaited the conclusion of the poem. “Yes, tolerably, Sare! I have a few good patrons, Sare! But money I do not think of. It is fame and immortality, Mr. Satchell!” he very earnestly replied. “True, that is the main point, I dare say! You said you had but seven lines to complete your ode, when you come into my room. Do you always calculate the lengths beforehand?” “Oh yes! This is a twenty-five line poem, Sare! Twenty-five cents was all Mr. Cologne said he could give me!” “You are writing it for a purfumer then?” “Oh, yes, Sir! Let me read it to you.” “I am quite satisfied it possesses merit! Don't take the trouble!” “But the first line Sare! You must know, Mr. Cologne is a very fashionable retail dealer in cosmetics. His rival, Mr. Lavender got me last week to write him a poetical advertisement; well, you see it took amazingly. You have no idea how it brought custom to the shop. A perfect rush, Sare! 'Saw your sweet poetry, Mr. Lavender,” says a beautiful lady, `and come to see what you had!' You have no idea, Sare! Well, Mr. Cologne finding how things were going, sends to me this morning to write him one that should out-clipse that I wrote for Mr. Lavender, his rival! So this is it! He is to give me twenty-five cents, Sare! Allow me to read it!—” “From Isles of Arabia and gardens of Ind, Borne on the Zephyrs of the soft-breathing wind The odors of Eden, the scents of each zone, Are received at the shop of Mister Cologne! There you'll find maidens fair, Soft oils for the hair! — There youll find gentle beau'x, Sweet smells for the nose! — There you'll find all the odors that ever was known In the fashionable shop of Mr. Cologne!” “That is what I call a climax, Sare!” “It is very fine!” “I see you appreciate poetry, Sare!” “You compliment me! How do these lines compare with those you wrote for Mr. Lavender?” “Bless you, Sare! They are not to be named in the same letters of the alphabet! Mr. Lavender is cut all out. But you havn't heard the whole!” “I can guess at the rest, from the specimen!” “Let me read to you Mr. Lavender's, Sare!” Here the excited poet rapidly opened his common-place book, which was made of some twenty leaves of brown-paper on which were pasted narrow newspaper columnar strips containing his lucubrations. To one of these he turned and began to read forth with as if he feared his auditor would not wait. “There is a shop in Washing' street.—” “What street is Washing' street, sir?” “Washington street, Sare! The last syllable is omitted by a sort of poetical license, because it makes the line too long for the ear. I have a desperate musical ear sure!” “I understand now!” “There is a shop in Washing' street Such as one doesn't every day meet, It is a store with windows four And a handsome sign above the door, Upon it as you pass it, sir, You'll see the name of Lavender! He keeps all sorts of scents and smells For tripping beaux or pritty belles! There's wash-balls.—” “That will do! I see you have in the other surpassed yourself in this one!” “Decidedly, Sare! It would give me very great pleasure to read both of them through to you, Sare!” “I should be sorry to detain you,” answered the lawyer with mock gravity. “I think I heard you say, you had to take them to the printer to night!” “Yes, sir—but—” “It is already past nine!” “Bless me! I did not believe it was so late!” exclaimed Mr. Rhymewell pulling at his fob, with an air, but coming in contact with his torn and buttonless waistband. “I shall be back in an hour, I will then pay you your rent. It is due to night, I believe. I always like to be punctual! It is a nine-pence a day for the room, which is for three days (I was to pay my rent every three days,) three nine-pences, which makes just thirty-seven and a half cents, Sare!” “In the morning will answer, as I shall be in bed when you come in! “How extremely condescending, Sare! I am delighted to see that I have so far your confidence that you are not afraid to trust me! I adore a man of honor like you, Sare! It was a glorious fortune that sent me here, Sare, to be your guest at a ninepence a day!” “How much have you made to day, Mr. Rhymewell?” asked the lawyer, curious to know how such a strange being lived; for he had seen him only four days before standing near the outer-door in the alley as he went out, and questioning Handy as to the probability of hiring a room in the tenement. Handy was just giving him suitable encouragement touching the matter when seeing Mr. Satchell he referred him to him, saying, `Here's de Boss, ax him and I guess he put you somewhar!' So, Mr. Satchell, who to do him jus landlord over the only tenement he owned rented him the room he now occupied at the rate of ninepence per diem, payable, at the end of every three days. Mr. Rhymewell herefore deposited himself there at once, hiring of Handy a mattrass or two cents a night, payable in advance, and negotiating with him or his meals at four cents each. Thus inducted into his new abode and provided for in his household matters Mr. Rhymewell had nothing to do but to devote his pen to the coining of the twenty-seven cents, per diem, aggregate, a very heavy sum for a penny a line poet to make up daily. But, thus far Mr. Rhymewell seemed to be doing a very prosperous business. “How much have I made, Sare?” repeated the poet. “Let me see! There is the poem for Mr Rowland Hill, Jr., the hair oil gentleman, that is a shilling! Then there is another for the Fur-store, that is eleven lines, eleven cents! How much is that, Sare? “Twenty-eight cents!” “Egzactly, Sare! Then here is this for Mister Cologne, this is twenty-five cents?” “That makes fifty-three cents!” “So it does! I had no idea it come to so much?” “How much did you make yesterday?” “I made my fourteen cents! I dont make so much every day, as to-day, Sare! This is one of my lucky days. Fridays are always lucky days to me!” “People generally call them unlucky.” “People! I don't level myself with the people, Sare! Genius has nothing in common with other men, Sare. I would walk on my head if I could!” “Are you now going out? It is a chilly night. Have you no over-coat?” “Over-coat! I scorn an over-coat! Sare,” responded Mr. Rhymewell, buttoning closely to his breast by its only button his short-waisted coat, and swelling out with his legs astride so that his short pants came above the tops of his dirty cotton socks. “Sare, a man who has true genius in his soul, never knows cold! He can't feel it, Sare. I don't feel it, Sare!” Mr. Rhymewell then took a very suspicious looking nap-worn white-hat with a very narrow brim from a nail, and thrust it upon his head, inclining it a little back. He folded his “ode” in his hand and strode to the door with an air as if he scorned using even legs to walk with. The lawyer took up his candle, which was nearly burned down into the ink-stand which served it as a candle-stick, and followed him out, for the poet seemed all at once to forget that he was there, or that his door had to be shut after him. Without a word he passed down the stairs three at a time, and the lawyer could hear him going through the entry below, muttering in a half-tragic tone, “Cold! who speaks of cold? none but the slave Whose naked limbs are bared to the northern blast, And who has no genius in his blackened soul! —” “What dat you say Massa Byrum 'bout bracking?” asked Handy, who was in his door polishing boots. “You want your shoe bracked I do 'em for half price! But if you wants de sole ob em bracked too, I axes two cent more!” “Out upon thee, son of Afric, out!” Thy speech smacks of thy grovellin' trade where all thy thoughts are! I scorn thy brush and thee!” Here the poet took one enormous stride and vanished into the alley. “Bress us! what am got inter Massa Byrum wid his poeticks to night? He am a berry odd man any how. He tell me git out for son of Africky! Bell it am a berry perlite way ob callin' a colored gemman a nigger!” Satchell who had heard all this, re-entered his office laughing like one who, with all his evil, could appreciate oddities of life and character in individuals. Handy began to sing “coal-brack Rose,” again, and Kaleb struck in with the “Cobbler's Song,” to the same tune; and thus their rival songs mingled harmoniously with each other. Handy. “Dat you Sambo, yess I com'! I am a little cobbler I have a little wife, Don't you hear de Banjo, Tum, Tum, Tum! I have a little stall, sir, Where I live a merry life, Rap away lapstone, Rap, rap, rap! Oh, Rose, coal black Rose, I wish I may be scotch'd If I don't lub Rose!” When the lawyer re-entered his room he carefully locked the door, and then going to his turn-up bedstead he let it down, discovering a door behind it. It was fastened by a pad-lock, which he removed, and taking in one hand a pistol from a shelf over the door and his candle, he opened the door and entered the room, the outer entrance to which was nailed up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM. We now go back with our readers to a period prior to the opening of our story, and present to them new scenes and new characters, but which equally with those already introduced, act their part in the progress and final denouement of the tale. About two months previous to the time when Satchell is introduced to the reader in his office, a young gentleman of fine appearance was standing by the window of one of the most elegant mansions overlooking the common. By his side was a lovely woman, scarcely in her twentieth summer. Their countenances expressed calm happiness and deep, unbroken affection. They were a young husband and his youthful bride. Their honeymoon, so far as that state was measured by days, was that day ended; for they had been married just four weeks. They were looking together and in silence at the golden September skies, as the evening sun dyed them with the most gorgeous hues, which a soft haze floating in the atmosphere mellowed with exquisite effect. “It was such an evening as this when we first met, Gertrude,” said the husband, turning his gaze upon her with the fullness of love. “The same thought was in my own heart,” she answered, smiling. “Do you think with your heart, dear wife?” “When I think of you, Edward,” she answered, looking up and answering his eyes with glances as deep and fond if not so ardent as his own. “How important to my happiness was that moment,” he continued. “It has cast its sweet influence over all my life. It will govern me with its power through eternity; for through eternity I shall love you.” “Yes, I feel that love like life, when once created can never die. We must always love.” “Always, and more and more if possible as time and eternity roll on,” he said earnestly. “You talk as if you were quite by yourselves, my wedded lovers,” said a voice kind and singularly agreeable in its tone, from the centre of the room. The young husband turned slightly, sufficient to catch the eye of his father, a well-made, intellectual looking gentleman, who had entered a few minutes before unobserved by them, though he took no pains to conceal his presence, and was now reading a book by the table. “Ah, father, you have been young once,” said the bridegroom. “Yes, and I know how to sympathize in your happiness. I love to hear you talk to Gertrude thus, and tell her how much you love her. It will make her happy. Tell her so every day, my son, if you live to be a hundred, and every day she will be made happier for it. Wives love to be told that they are loved. It makes them good wives.” “An excellent lesson, dear father Judge,” said the bride, laughing till her beauty seemed so sparkling that the father-in-law and husband looked upon her in silent admiration. She blushed at this, but her loveliness was enhanced though in a new aspect. “We will talk lower, sir,” observed Edward Manning, turning his eyes once more upon the landscape before them. “Do you know, dear Gertrude, by what a mere accident I happened to be at Mount Holyoke at that time? I had planned to go to Montreal and tour it through the Canadas, and was on my way there through Northampton, when the stage stopped merely to dine. After dinner I strolled through the streets, the landlord saying I should have half an hour, as something had to be done to the coach before starting. When I went back, I found that the stage had gone, but leaving my baggage. There I was detained for another day. But as I had my own time I did not complain, and I resolved to embrace the opportunity to ascend Mount Holyoke; for on the books at the inn I had seen the names of a party from New York, which had gone to the mountain. Somehow your name, Gertrude Livingston, on the book struck me at first seeing it. I felt inspired with curiosity to see the fair owner, for I instinctively felt she must be fair.” “How disappointed you were when you saw me! I recollect you started with quite a shock when your friend, Doctor Wells-borough, who was with us, introduced you as we encountered upon the very apex among the clouds.” “You know better, wife. I was struck at your beauty, or rather I was smitten on the spot. From that moment I was yours, and now you are mine. I do not believe that it was an accident by which I came to know you. I am positive it was the ordering of a kind Providence. So much of my life's happiness could not have had its origin merely in the inadequate incident that I was three minutes too late for a stage.” “You are no believer in accidents of any kind, Edward.” “No, I am not. An accident might overturn a world as well as a coach, if God did not control accidents. An accident might have destroyed all the circumstances of prophecy. An accident might have cut off the years of, if I may with holy reverence thus speak, the infant Saviour, unless accidents are under the control of an almighty law. There is properly no such thing as an accident. What are called such are permitted links in the chain of human events, and all have their errands and ends. There goes by a carriage containing a happy family, father and mother and children. Yonder boy throws the stone he holds in his hand through the air, and it strikes one of the horses in the eye. The animals dart away affrighted, the carriage is overturned, the parents are killed; the children live, and are found to be without means of support; they are cast upon the world, become vicious and criminal through the want of parental control and guidance, and by and by they end their lives upon the gallows or in a prison. Will any one say that all these events were the result of an accident, Gertrude? If so, then all terrestrial events are nothing more nor less than accidents. No! God is over all. Not a sparrow falls to the ground without his notice.” “I think with you, dearest Edward. I cannot believe that all my present happiness in your love is owing to an accident. I would not believe it, else I should believe, too, that—but I will not utter what was upon my lips.” 3 “That what, Gertrude? Let me know your thought.” “That accident, too, might destroy our love.” “Never, dearest Gertrude—never.” “I know it never will. You spoke of our first meeting on Mount Holyoke a year ago, and the beauty of the sunset, such an one as this. Do you remember how different was our wedding-day—all clouds and thunder, and the most fearful lightning.” “You look pale at the recollection, Gertrude. I should think you were superstitious, if I did not know you so well.” “No, I am not. But one can't help impressions. They will force themselves down upon the soul and darken it. Do you know that I more than once on our way to church to be married, had it upon my lips to entreat you to turn back and put off the ceremony to another and more propitious day.” “Did you then take the gloom and storm of the day so seriously to heart?” he said, with surprise and sympathy. “Yes, but I have not thought of it since until just now, when you compared the beauty of this evening with that of our first meeting. Then I recalled irresistibly the tempestuous day of our nuptials.” “Be assured it is no evil omen. Sunshine and happiness follow storms,” said Judge Manning, approaching the window smiling.— “Why what a superstitious beauty you are, Gertry,” he added, tapping her shoulder. “I am not so at all, my dear Judge. I was merely comparing one day with another day,” she said, laughing without a shade of solicitude. “Come, dear father,” she said, drawing towards the window recess a large velvet-cushioned parlor easy-chair, “come and sit down here by us and be sociable. We are not such young lovers that we must talk all the time between ourselves.” “I will sit by you with pleasure,” answered the Judge, with a fine cheerful expression of paternal pride and affection, as he looked upon one and then upon the other, as they sat upon the fauteuils of the window, one on either side of him. And well might he gaze upon the noble pair with pride and fondness. His son, his only child, not only possessed a fine person and a face expressive of intellect and elevated character, but his mind was stored with profound scholastic knowledge and with elegant literature, and his heart was pure and undefiled by contact with the vices that throng the paths of young men. He had graduated at Cambridge with the highest honors, and left the walls of the university with a reputation for excellency of moral character that eclipsed that which he had won for ascendency of intellect. He left college without an enemy, and the centre of friendship for a hundred noble hearts. His father, who was a Judge of high eminence, had destined him for the bar, to which he saw from his talents and virtues that he would be a brilliant ornament. But the law was not the profession that held out to Edward Manning any attractions. His feelings and tastes early prepossessed him in favor of the church; and greatly to his father's surprise he made known to him, soon after leaving college, his predilection. The choice which he thus betrayed did not displease the Judge, although it disappointed him. Ho used no arguments to dissnade him, well aware that young men are generally the best judges for themselves in the selection of a profession. He knew that he would be an ornament to the sacred calling he had embraced, distinguished and useful. After three years devoted to the study of theology, Edward Manning took orders; but he for the present declined a parish. He wished to devote himself more closely to studies before taking an active part in the ministry. He was rich, and was therefore not driven, like most young gentlemen, at once into the field. He felt that he was yet very young, and he was diffident of his own talents as a speaker. His father also had desired him for the present to remain with him. It was during a few weeks traveling recreation in the summer of the year previous to his introduction to the reader that he met with Gertrude Livingston, in the manner already stated. This young lady was every way fitted to become the wife of such a person. She was accomplished, high-born, and lovely in mind and person, and possessed a very noble and generous nature. The union of their hearts was based on an instinctive perception of the excellencies of each other's character. At the period of our story they had been but a few weeks married.—a period of unalloyed and rational happiness. A few days before the evening on which we see them at the window they had returned from Saratoga, whither they had gone on their bridal tour from New York. The day previous he had decided upon accepting the charge of a parish in the city. Such were the condition, prospects and circumstances of the young gentleman whom we have thus introduced to the reader as a fond and happy husband. There is no wonder that his father gazed upon his fine, manly and intelligent face with pride; or that he regarded with affectionate interest the charming features of his lovely bride. “Now, my dear father, that we have got you here between us,” said Gertrude, “I am determined you shall make us a promise.” “Well, what is it? I am in the humor to promise you any thing.” “That you will not say one word more against our going to housekeeping?” “I can't promise that. I assure you, you won't have my consent. What do you want, I pray? Haven't I here a large house all furnished, and every thing all to your hand? What do you want more? This is your house, so long as I am in it.” “True, dear Judge,” answered the lady, with a charming air; “but then it isn't my house, you know. A bride loves to keep house of all things. Really I shan't realize I am any body, unless I have a house to manage.” “I see how it is, lady fair,” responded the Judge, pleasantly. “You want to have a house all to yourself, so that you can manage your husband.” “What an idea, dear Judge!” “It is the very idea, I'll be bound, that is in your head.” “Yes, I dare say it, father,” observed Edward, laughing. “Se for fear of consequences, I shall vote against housekeeping.” “You promised you would be neutral, Edward, and leave it to the Judge and me.” “So I will. But really I should prefer, Gertrude, remaining here. You will be installed in my father's house precisely as if it were your own.” “But I fear I should reign only a short while; for I know a secret, Judge.” “Do you, you beauty, hey?” responded the Judge, slightly coloring. “Yes, I do. So I fear I should have to abdicate before many months.” “What do you suspect?” demanded the Judge, smiling consciously. “I don't suspect what I am quite certain of. Confess it, Judge?” “Well, I plead guilty, and throw myself on the mercy of the court.” “Then you are going to marry the handsome Widow Winterley?” “Yes, if she doesn't change her mind before spring,” responded the Judge, looking very pleasantly embarrassed. “It isn't to take place till spring.” “Oh, that will give me but six months reign here; so I think we had best go to housekeeping at once. Perhaps the widow will relent, and name next month.” “What! so soon after Ned's marriage?” “Why not, father?” “Yes, why not, pray? You speak as if he had been buried instead of married. We must have it as soon as we get to housekeeping.” “Well, if you say so.” “Yes, dear father,” answered both together, “it must be next month.” “I will see the lady and tell her what you say. I rather think she will not object; for to tell you the truth she fears some what lest you won't like it at all.” “I shall be very glad of it, sir,” answered his son. “She is an estimable person, and I have no doubt will render you happy.” “Thank you, dear boy. I will go and see her this very evening.” The servant now brought in candles, the curtains were drawn, and leaving the window they soon after proceeded to the tea-table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. THE “TIMSES.” About three weeks after the conversation detailed in the preceding chapter, the beautiful wife of the young clergyman found herself presiding over “a household of her own.” The residence which Edward had chosen was in one of the handsome streets that run northward from Beacon, and it was one of the most elegant in the street. The house was purchased for him by his father, and presented to him; while Gertrude, with a portion of her own splendid fortune, insisted upon furnishing it. Her taste and wealth were exquisitely apparent in the minutest detail, as well as in the grander features of the sumptuous apartments. A refined elegance and a just taste prevailed throughout. In addition to costly mirrors, priceless pictures, velvet lounges, alabaster vases, statuary, and a thousand ornamental, yet useful articles, that enriched her drawing-rooms and parlors, there was a handsome library, most luxuriously arranged, for Edward, and a charming conservatory, filled with the most rare and fragrant flowering plants. The conservatory was a long, glass-enclosed gallery, overlooking the garden; and, besides the ranges of beautiful vases for plants, it contained in the centre a vast marble fountain, in which swam dazzling schools of gold and silver fish; and around the conservatory, hanging among the foliage of the taller trees, were suspended small gilt cages, containing singing birds. Not far from the fountain was a little artificial bower, of the most tasteful construction, in which were seats for two, Edward and herself, and a small marble table in the midst for her work-basket, a book, or even for the salver to stand upon, whenever she invited her husband from his library, which opened into the conservatory, to take tea with her; which was a treat, she said playfully, she should extend to him but once a week, lest, if granted more frequently, he should lightly esteem it, and not look upon it as a privilege. Wealth, in the hands of the refined and pure-hearted, comes to its right uses. It can make earth a paradise; and such will earth be, when riches are at every one's command, and all are good, and in charity each with his neighbor. When innocence, love to God, and charity towards our neighbor, prevail in the hearts of the whole human race, then will riches be the greatest earthly blessing, instead, as too often now, the greatest curse, vouchsafed to our race. It will make an Eden of the globe, and earth correspond to Heaven in excellence and beauty. How perfectly happy were Edward and Gertrude in their new abode, their first home! If happiness could be found on earth, it dwelt with them. They were virtuous; they feared God; they had the goods of this life, and the calm hope of the life to come, (a source of ineffable happiness in itself;) they were intellectual; they were rationally intelligent; they had minds to comprehend and hearts to feel the beauties and glories of creation; they had refined and accurately cultivated tastes, elevated and purified by religion, the spiritual alembic of the human soul; they loved one another with that pure and virtuous love which adores without idolatry. Linked heart and heart by sympathy of mind, and tastes, and hopes, they were one rather than two. The most perfect mutual confidence and trust dwelt in their bosoms; and so closely were they united in spirit, that it would seem that, if Edward should feel a grief, though absent from her, she would know, and share, and feel it instinctively, miles though they were divided. Such was their love—such their happiness. But, alas! human happiness is never enduring. It is either terminated by our own restlessness and follies, or by the means of the envy and malice of our enemies. Like the happiness of our first parents in Eden, their bliss had an envious and hateful spectator. There was one who planned the destruction of their peace, and who brought to this end all the strong energies of his mind, and the deep evil of his heart. We have already alluded to the degradation of Simmins Satchell from the bar, which he had talents to have adorned, if his moral obliquity of character had not diverted him from the path of honor. We will now proceed to explain the causes which led to it, before we go on to show the results which are to follow it. Simmins Satchell was a native of one of the country towns of a State adjoining the commonwealth. His father was a man in low life; the highest occupation to which he ever was known to attain was to help keep bar in the village inn on the grand occasions of general muster and fourth of July. At such times, he was paid in as much as he could drink, and a quart of rum to carry home. But there was many a four-pence-half-penny, too, that should have gone into the money-draw, that mysteriously found its way into his sleeve. On other days, Tim Satchell, as he was called, used to get a living by doing “chores,” sawing half a cord of wood when driven to extremities, and sometimes carrying “the squire's” marketing home for him; but his favorite mode of raising the wind was in holding travelers' horses, at which genteel profession he used to make sometimes two shillings a day. This pursuit was just idle enough to suit Tim, as he could sit about all day on the benches in the gallery of the inn; and so, if any one charged him with being an idle vagabond, he could reply that he was “vaitin' for 'osses.” And in waiting for “'osses” Tim passed the most of his time. Tim ostensibly had a home, but it was only a lodging-place. It was a wretched, one-story cabin, on the skirts of the town, remarkable for the rags in the windows, which rags, by computation, if sold, would have paid for glazing them. The house was a wretched, tumble-down affair altogether, that a southern slave would turn up his nose at, and in which no southern master would put a slave to live. It was a bleak, desolate abode, with broken door pannels, and, in winter, no wood-pile. No wonder that Tim loved the tavern, with its pleasant, sunny gallery, and loafer's bench, its warm bar-room fire in winter, its constantly changing company, life, talk, and tippling! There was always something going on at the tavern in sympathy with Tim's feelings; when he was a sociable, dram-loving poor devil. There were the stages to come in and start out four times in the course of the day, when it was quite a busy time for Tim, who always, if not too tipsy, was found at the leaders' bits; and, if he happened to be too far gone for this, he would watch from the bench, with great cugers, the letting down of the steps, the getting in of the passengers, the shutting up of the steps, and fastening of the door. He would dreamily inspect the process of the driver's mounting his box, gathering up his reins, taking his whip and giving it the preliminary flourish in the air. Crack! away bound the leaders! the wheelers dance, and prance, and follow! The stage whirls away after them, when Tim, inspired by the excitement, catching off his old hat, swings it, and gives two tipsy cheers and a half, sinks away into a toper's snooze, with his hurrahing hat feebly sinking to his side, his unshaven chin fallen upon his breast, his red, foolish-looking eyes closing with a ludicrous series of winks, and his whole form as supple as an India rubber man. Then there was the constant arrival and departure of travelers; there were groups talking politics before the door to listen to; there was a trade in horses to watch; or a menagerie come to put up and perform, and bills to be posted, when Tim was in his element. No wonder Tim liked to be at the tavern! It was a sort of paradise to him. It was, moreover, his place of business—his exchange. His house presented quite opposite images. There was Tim's wife— naturally a good-hearted woman and kind, but who, with the cares of a large family and Tim's idleness and intemperance, had lost her patience with her beauty, and was now become a perfect virago, at least to Tim. He never came home at night that she did n't give him the gall that had laid in her heart for him all day; he never left in the morning without an inverted blessing, and the charitable wish that he might get his neck broke in a gutter before she laid eyes upon him again. Tim used to say that it was his wife's tongue made him drink, and drove him to the tavern. But this was a slander, and, unfortunately, a very common one, from Tim Satchell's. Tim knew, and so do most other Tims know the same, that “her tongue” was the effect, not the cause. Tim began to drink when she loved him, and her tongue was kindly in its cadence. By and by, as he neglected her, his family, and his own character, she became soured. She saw that her visions of happiness were wrecked; for all young women who marry look for happiness. When young women marry young men, the young men are not drunkards; they are upright; their cheeks are fresh with health; their eyes sparkle with hope and beam with love, whether the young man be a farmer or mechanic. It is a marriage of love, and youth, and hopes of happiness. All marry, the lowest and humblest marry, with such hopes. So had the wife of Tim wedded him. She was nineteen, and rosy and healthy, and loved him heartily; for he was then hale, strong, and kind-hearted and, she thought, handsome. But a few years passed on, and Tim took to tippling, by degrees at first; but by and by he became a confirmed inebriate. His poor wife, shivering over the few embers upon her hearth, remembers their wedding-day, and the first few months of their married life, and weeps. But tears will not always flow. By and by, after months of wo and privation, their fountain is dried up. The spirit becomes hardened, and the spirit yields angry fire instead of tears. The voice becomes harsh in addressing the wronger, and the eye welcomes him, in his beastly intoxication, with scorn and hatred instead of love. No, there is no more love! Stern endurance has taken the place of all the gentler emotions. Alas, for the wife of the inebriate! Who will condemn the cross wife, because she is cross? Has she not enough to sour her spirit and embitter her words? Who that hears the wretched mother, in the midst of her ragged and father-deserted brood, lifting her voice, and dealing her blows to the right and left, will condemn? Be assured, that the voice of anger, and the language of the virago, is oftener the expression of a broken heart and crushed hopes, seared into sternness, than the manifestation of a hard heart and cruel temper. Speak to her kindly. Hear her tale of crushed hopes, of privation, of insult, of neglect, of poverty, of cares that seemed too hard to be borne. Who would be even as sweet-tempered as she? Judge not. Beneath all that seems harsh and evil, lies a crushed heart! When we look at the stars, we place to our eyes a telescope. When we look upon the poor, let us use the lens of charity, which magnifies and brings in the foreground the good, but diminishes and removes at a distance the evil. Tim Satchell was not driven from his home to the tavern by his wife's tongue, as he told every body,—villain that he was, thus to speak evil of her whom he had sworn to love and cherish, not to dishonor! Her bitterness of words was the consequence of his degradation, and neglect of her. How could she receive kindly the man who had made himself a by-word? Was she not, as his wife, degraded? were not his children degraded? She was “drunken Tim's wife;” they were “drunken Tim's children.” Thus were they designated, she and the babes of her bosom, through him who should have been a sun to his household, to dispense light and glory therein. What wonder that she should look upon her ragged babes, as they cried around her for food, as they grew up in poverty and vice, and pilfered, and cursed, and got evil names in the town,— what wonder that she should look from them to him, and curse him in her heart? The wretched interior of his cabin, no furniture, no food to eat, no fire-wood, crying, tattered children, a sour-featured wife,—no wonder that Tim loved the tavern, and hated his home! But he had himself made his home the hell he called it, and felt it to be. In this home, if such it be called, Simmins Satchell first saw the light. He had the advantage, from being the oldest, to have passed the first five or six years in comparative happiness, compared with the infancy of his numerous brothers and sisters, especially the later ones; for each succession entered upon a harder lot than the preceding. The father was more brutal and idiotic, the mother crosser, the poverty deeper, and starvation more certain; for food was less, and mouths more. These children, nine in all, grew up like cats and dogs. They ate nothing that all did not fight for; they squabbled and fought like dogs for bones; they hated each other, as hungry children will, because each saw in his brother or sister a devourer of food which he wanted. The children of Tim, indeed, could be likened to a litter of young wolves, without stretching for a comparison. As soon as they could run about, they stole apples and fruit, and whatever they could get. Three or four of them had even been known to sally out after a large dog carrying a bone in his mouth, attack him with sticks till he dropped it, and then attack each other for its possession. Young Simmins, as he grew up to stout boyhood, had got to be a thorough-paced rogue; for his early advantages, during his father's industrious years, had only made him more skillful and intelligent. At sixteen, he would lead his whole horde of brothers and sisters, not even excepting the one three years old, next to the infant, to rob orchards, hen-roosts, yards, and barns, till they became so formidable, from their number, adroitness, and daring, that the town took the matter in hand. Simmins, and three of his brothers, were one night waylaid and caught in the act of climbing a garden fence, with arms filled with vegetables, chickens, clothes from the line, and other articles that they had fallen in with in their foraging. These being handed over to citizens in waiting, the constables entered the garden, and found two of the “Tim-girls,” stripping a plum-tree; these, by great fleetness of foot, escaped. The house was then approached, and, through a broken pane of glass in the sink-room window, they saw the heels and little legs and back of a young “Tim” coming out. They received him in their arms, much to his surprise, and found his little fists—for he was not five years old—filled with silver spoons! The next morning, they were all had up before a magistrate, and all but Simmins were sent to the poor-house for a month, to pick oakum, greatly to the relief of their mother, who had no more control over them than over so many rattle-snakes. Simmins met with a different fortune, and one which led the way to his future career as a lawyer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. THE LAWYER. The justice before whom Simmins was arraigned was a shrewd man of the world and possessed much knowledge of character, for one who had moved only in the narrow sphere of a country shire-town. When Simmins was brought before him to receive his sentence, which was after the rest of the young thieves had got theirs, his air was so bold and impudent that the justice stared at him for some minutes, as if he had been inspecting for the first time a young panther. Simmins returned the look with the utmost coolness and assurance, and was the first to speak, observing,— “I 'xpect you mean to know me next time, old 'un.” “I do indeed, my lad. What is your name?” “Sim Satchell.” “You have been caught stealing, and have besides a notorious character as a universal young reprobate. What reason have you to offer why I shouldn't commit you?” “Because I was not caught stealing,” answered the boy, boldly. “Do you deny it? You were caught with your arms filled with vegetables and apples and chickens in a bag.” “That wasn't bein' cocht stealin', old blue nose, responded Simmins, confidently. “It amounts to the same thing, you scamp.” “Not a bit of it. How does eny body know I stole 'em? I confess, old chap, the officy gripped me a climbin' the fence and the things in my hands. But he can't prove I stole 'em.” “Can't? What a brazen-faced little rascal! The vegetables and chickens were proved to belong to Doctor Bentick, whose garden you were in.” “I doubt that. How could he identify vegetables afore he ever saw 'em dug out o' the ground? and how could he swear to a chicken bein' his as had been picked? And suppose he did know 'em be hisn', and they was found on us, I'd like to know who'd swear on the book we hadn't picked up and found 'em a'ter another thief had stole 'em and throw'd 'em away? Afore you send me to jail, old spectacles, I'd like to have you and the blessed constybles here prove as I stole the articles as was found on me. Till they prove that, I stand here on my rights as a 'merican citizen and a freeman!” The squire was altogether confounded by this bold defence and sophistical argument from a ragamuffin of seventeen; and being a just man and somewhat conscientious, and by no means versed in the subtleties of the law, he thought that the lad had presented a difficulty that could not be got over. He therefore turned to the constables and the other witnesses present, and called upon them to know whether they were ready to take oath on the Bible and at the risk of their soul's salvation, that the prisoner stole the articles that were found upon him. “I have not the least doubt but that he did steal them,” added the worthy justice; “but unless you can make oath to the fact, I shall feel it my duty to acquit him and let him go.” Neither of the constables were willing to peril salvation by making oath to the fact; and the justice turning to the prisoner, said as follows:— “Sim Satchell, you are a thief and a rogue, and stole the things; there is no question about it in my mind. But it can't be sworn to, and so you are at liberty to go about your business. But first let me ask you if you wouldn't like to study law with me; for you will be either a lawyer or a rogue.” “I see no choice between 'em, old 'un.” “Well, I want a boy, and I have some old law-books in my office. I have nothing that you can steal, for I am a bachelor, and board, and have nothing but what I have on my back. If you have a mind to come and live with me and try to be honest, it's a bargain. I can manage you, and I'll promise I'll make an honest man of you.” “It's done, squire. I'll live with you and do your chores, if you'll give me schoolin'.” “Good! I like that. A boy that wants to learn isn't quite reprobate. Yes, you shall go to school six months in the year.” The same evening Simmins Satchell was domiciliated in the justice's office, where he had a mattrass to sleep on, taking his meals at the second table at the squire's boarding house. The justice had said truly there was nothing to steal unless he stole old newspapers and a thumbed copy of the Revised Statutes, out of which his honor got all his law learning. The squire, as the event showed, was not disappointed in his charge. Simmins took to books with a passion that was truly wonderful, and betrayed a degree of intelligence that astonished the town schoolmaster. His advances in study were rapid and thorough, and the more he learned the less wild and vicious he was. He literally devoured books, and at the expiration of a year the master said he “had taught him all he knew.” The squire now resolved to remove him to an academy, for Simmins had proved as faithful an errand and office-boy as he had proved at school; and the squire seeing the talent that he displayed, congratulated himself on having diverted him from robbing orchards and hen-roosts into a more honorable channel. Simmins was sent to the academy at the squire's expense, and at the expiration of fifteen months was fitted for college. His patron now resolved, being a man of substance and childless, to adopt him and complete his work by giving him a university education. At the age of twenty-three Simmins Satchell graduated from the university, and with the second honor, the first, which he aimed for, being carried off by his classmate, George Manning, whom the reader has already seen as Judge Manning. This defeat he attributed to partiality and favoritism in behalf of his rival, who was of a distinguished aristocratic family, while he himself was of no family, or worse than none. He, therefore, never forgave the university nor his successful rival. Perhaps his complaint was justly founded, for until a few weeks previous to the commencement it was generally believed that Satchell would have the first honor. His scholarship both in languages and mathematics stood high,— the highest in his class. But he was unpopular, His manners were rude and uncivil, and he but little regarded the social amenities of life. On the other hand, Manning was not only an elegant scholar but an accomplished gentleman. If partiality was shown, it was based on feeling rather than from any intention of complimenting an aristocratic name. Simmins had a passion for the law, and entered the law school, where he soon distinguished himself in the moot courts for his eloquence, close reasoning and legal acumen in debate. George Manning was in the class with him, and Simmins strove his utmost to surpass him. Revenge gave brilliancy and power to his eloquence, and success crowned his exertions in almost every attempt; for now that Manning, the wealthy and the gifted, had passed with honor the ordeal of the university, he felt less ambitious of distinction in the law school, willing to exist on his past honors, and feeling that he would have years to perfect himself in law, while kicking his feet for clients. Besides, being rich he felt no spur to undue exertions. But with Satchell circumstances were different, and hatred urged him on. He took his degree of law with honor, and at once went into the city to practice the profession upon the threshold of which he had entered. His patron and friend the justice died before he got through the law-claims, leaving him all his worldly goods, which amounted to about six thousand dollars. Of this Satchell had four thousand when he went into town and opened his office in Court street. His talents had already preceded him, and he had not been in town a month before as many as six applications or proposals had been made to him by old established members of the bar to form a copartnership; for a young talented lawyer is a very desirable acquisition for an old practitioner. Satchell, however, with that independence characteristic of him, declined to enter into any such union, resolving to make his own way by his own merits. He soon got into a busy and profitable practice, and the future seemed to hold out to his grasp the highest honors of his profession. But there existed a moral obstacle to his high advancement; this was his total deficiency in principles. He had no religious feelings, nor had he ever given a thought to his Creator. He knew, for he lived in a Christian land and could not but know, that there was a God, a Bible, a crucified Saviour, a heaven and hell, and that he possessed a soul. But these ideas were entertained in his mind only as vague notions, without any definite reflection upon them. It was the same to him whether Christ or Mahomet were the Saviour. It was the same to him whether men believed the Koran or the Bible. He believed neither. In a word, he was an infidel. He, therefore, could nave no principle. He who believes not in a Deity can have no restraint upon his conduct, beyond the fear of personal inconvenience from the criminal law courts. He will do what he finds it in his heart to do. Such a man was Simmins Satchell, Esq. Ambitious, talented, aspiring to the highest eminence in his profession, he was destined to fall. He needed Integrity at the helm, and without her he was wrecked. In the course of his practice, about seven or eight years after his admission to the bar, he was appointed executor to an estate, and also guardian to a ward then within three years of majority. The dishonest lawyer saw that there was an opportunity through this executorship of enriching himself and impoverishing the heir. But to effect this it became necessary to forge certain papers, and to erase signatures from others. After calculating all the chances of detection and weighing them against the profit, he resolved to yield to the temptation, or rather suggestion; for there can be properly no temptation when the mind is previously prepared to evil. A suggestion is all that is requisite to be readily adopted. The forgeries and the erasures were effected in the secresy of his own chamber, and he felt sure that detection could not follow. But among Satchell's negligent habits was one of leaving small silver change and pennies loose upon his table. This display had more than once caught the sharp eyes of a lad who belonged in the office upon the floor directly above that occupied by Satchell, and who was frequently sent by his employer to and fro to the office of the former on errands. After devising various modes to possess himself unseen of the coin that he always saw there, more or less of it, when he called, he at length hit upon a plan. One day, when Satchell had gone out to an eating-house to dine, as was his custom, the boy provided with a small gimlet augur, locked himself in his own office, his master being at dinner, and began to bore a hole through the floor. In a few minutes he had an orifice through the plank and the lathe and plastering underneath in which he could thrust his little finger. Looking down and seeing upon the table directly beneath a ninepence and three or four fourpences he looked very well satisfied, and prepared to take possession of them in the following manner: From his pocket he took a fishing-line, upon the extremity of which was secured a heavy leaden sinker. Upon the flat bottom of this sinker he stuck some very soft and adhesive shoemaker's wax. He then dropped the plummet thus prepared through the opening and carefully let it descend over the table. By careful observation and adroit management of the line he dipped it upon the quarter of a dollar, and caught the coin up by the wax. He now raised it up with great joy, when to his disappointment he found on drawing it up to the hole that it would not by any means pass through. He therefore had to let it drop, and content himself with the fourpences, three of which he succeeded in transferring from the table beneath into his trowsers pocket. He now drew up his line and stopped the hole in the floor with a viol cork, which he besmeared so that it should not be observed. In this manner this ingenious young gentleman of fourteen amused himself for some days, as often as his observation made known to him that the lawyer had placed other “fourpences” upon the table. Mr. Satchell had missed the small coin, but well knowing no one had been in his office he attributed it to absence of mind on his own part, supposing that he had taken them up and paid them away. The large pieces remaining and the small ones only disappearing, entirely prevented him from suspecting the entrance of a thief. At length on the day upon which he resolved to execute his forgeries, he, for greater privacy, carefully curtained his windows and even filled the key-hole with mashed paper. The young money-lifter supposing he had gone to dinner, (for Satchell had chosen for his purpose the dinner hour, when all the lawyers occupying the building were out,) drew out the cork from his opening, for the purpose of bobbing for more silver fish. To his surprise he saw the crown of Satchell's black head beneath. Hoping he would soon leave, curiosity led him to watch him to see what he was doing, so that he might form a guess how long he would remain;— for his own master, a man of small appetite and very industrious, and withal a great envier of Satchell's large practice, never was away more than half an hour. There were, as it happened, more than the usual number of fourpences upon the table, and the fisher was very impatient to monopolize them. He felt, therefore, very solicitous for Satchell's departure in time for him to operate. But he found that he was not likely to go very soon, and after watching him till he was tired, he got up to stop up the orifice lest his master should catch him at his pastime. But before he could get off from his knees his master was at the door. He flew to unlock it, knowing he could not answer why he had locked it, but the attorney had already discovered that it was bolted. The boy nevertheless unlocked it as quickly as possible, and stood before him coloring and trembling. “Locking the door!” exclaimed he. “What is this for? what have you been at?” “Nothing, sir.” “Nothing?” and the attorney's quick eye flew round the room, to see if he could not detect the something he well knew he had been at. The unlucky cork upon the floor and then the freshly bored augur-hole caught his glance. “What is this? what have you been doing, sirrah?” he demanded; and as he spoke he stooped to examine. He found the hole went through into the room beneath. He looked down, very naturally. He saw lawyer Satchell at work over papers with a pen. He seemed to be practicing signatures. The attorney placed his eye close and could read the signatures. At length he saw him make one at the foot of a deed, and then append one to another engraved paper. He then saw him with his penknife begin to erase a name from a deed, which name the attorney recognized as that of the deceased testator.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. THE PLAN OF REVENGE. As soon as the attorney made this discovery, he became very deeply interested in what was going on; so much so, that he quite forgot his boy, who was looking at him, as he crouched upon his knees, with not a little wonder. The height at which the attorney was above the lawyer was fourteen feet,—a distance not too remote to prevent him from satisfying himself that Mr. Satchell was “making foul play,” as he afterwards expressed it, with the signatures of deeds, conveyances, and vouchers. He distinctly saw him erase one name from a parchment, and substitute another; and both names he was able to read. He saw him alter dates, and do other acts that satisfied him that he was engaged in unlawful altering and mutilating of papers, the integrity of which was of the highest importance to the ward whose guardian he was. Having fully convinced himself that the lawyer was executing bold forgeries, he rose from his knees, and, looking his surprised office-boy in the face, told him to remain there while he went below, and to let no one in. He then hastened down stairs, and knocked at the door of Satchell's chamber. He listened, and could hear a hurried gathering up of papers. He knocked again, but there was no reply. He repeated the knock, and no answer was returned. He peeped in at the key-hole, but saw that it was stopped carefully with paper. Satisfied that Satchell was in, this silence and precaution confirmed him in his guilt, if he needed to be confirmed. He left the door, and went into Mr. Manning's office, on the same floor, and informed him of what he had discovered. George Manning, Esq., was then the District Attorney. The result was, that the attorney openly, in full court, charged Satchell with the crime of forgery, and in this manner:—Satchell was retained for a defendant, and the attorney for the plaintiff. When the case was called, the attorney rose and said, boldly, that he begged leave to decline engaging in a cause where the opposite party retained a forger as its counsel. Satchell was seen to turn deadly pale, and, conscious of guilt for a moment, was confounded both at the knowledge of his crime and its open exposure. The bench and bar were amazed, and the whole court was excited. “What do you mean, sir?” at length demanded Satchell, fixing upon him a look of defiance. “I mean,” answered the attorney “that I here openly in the face of this court charged you with forgery. I have waited until this time that I might know whether the deeds you forged would be recorded by you as they were falsely executed. I have this morning visited the records and find that you have recorded them as you forged them. I now pronounce you a forger and I dare you to deny the charge!” “Are you ready to substantiate this accusation, sir?” asked the judge of the attorney. “I am, sir,” firmly responded the attorney. “And it is my intention to enter prosecution in behalf of the heir whom by his forgeries he would defraud out of her estate.” “What have you to say to this, Mr. Satchell,” inquired the judge, “it is true my question is informal and as you have not been prosecuted you are at liberty to answer or not, or proceed with your client's case.” “I shall not proceed with it, sir! I shall leave the court, and before I enter it again, I trust I shall be able, your honor, to vindicate myself from this charge!” Satchell spoke quietly and like an innocent man. He gathered up his papers, took his hat and walked out of the court house. He left behind him the impression that he was innocent and that the attorney had been precipitate. But the next day the district attorney, Mr. Manning, prosecuted, a bill having been found against him; although Satchell made an able defence he was convicted, degraded from the profession by a solemn resolution of the Bar, and was sentenced by the judge to a year's imprisonment. Attributing, as he did, his conviction to the eloquence and profound arguments of the district attorney, Mr. Manning, his former hostility rankled deeper than ever in his heart; and in the silence and solitude of his cell he meditated against him the most finished vengeance. But years passed by after his discharge before he could decide in what manner he should effect his revenge upon the man he hated above all men living. Murder he did not meditate, for to kill an enemy he felt was not to be avenged upon him. He resolved that when he meted out to him his revenge he should feel it, be conscious of it, and suffer! To take away a man's life to punish him he thought folly; and justly so, for how can a man be considered an object of punishment or vengeance when he is dead? With life ceases the power of his foe over him! Therefore, Satchell devised some mode that should reach his heart, not his life. Not a day of the eleven years which had expired since he left his prison, had he suffered to pass without meditating upon his vengeance; but so deep and thorough did he mean that it should be, so above all other ordinary modes of revenge, that he could not decide in what shape to effect his object. A score of plans he had conceived of and half-resolved to execute, but they fell far short of the broad limits of his hatred and he rejected them. In the mean while he devoted his talents and profession to the basest of uses. He became notorious as the “Rogues Lawyer,” and walked abroad among honorable men, like Satan among angels. Every one knew him and shunned him. He would pass along from one end of a crowded street to the other, and no eye met his in friendly recognition, no voice of friendship or of acquaintance fell upon his ear. Yet all knew him, for he was a marked man. The good would not notice him, the evil who knew him and had had business with him feared to notice him, lest they should be seen and importuned of being one of his clients. Such was the man, Simmins Satchell, at the time that we introduce him to the reader in his den of an office in the obscure alley in the precincts of old Cornhill. A few weeks before this period, his long brooding revenge had hatched a plan of vengeance, that seemed to him to embrace all that his hatred of his enemy could desire to compass. George Manning, Esq., had now become a judge of the Supreme court and stood at the very head of the bar as a profound jurist and practical lawyer. For his elevation and virtues, Satchell, if this could be possible, hated him the more. He had, at one time, conceived, among others a plan for destroying this high character, by a conspiracy to make him suspected of bribery in his official capacity; but the difficulty of substantiating the fact, even by the false oaths of certain criminals who had been acquitted, which he could have obtained for money, led him to abandon this mode. At length his fertile brain conceived a plan that astonished even himself for the depth of its diabolical iniquity. It possessed the advantage over all others which he had contemplated, of being a three-fold vengeance, a barb, not only armed with one point but with three. The idea came to his mind in the following manner: About five weeks before the opening of our story, he was seated in his office reading the morning paper. His door was locked as usual and his room wore the same dark, dingy, chaotic aspect which has already been described. He felt at the time in particularly good spirits, for he had just learned from one of his emissaries the success of a plan he had projected, for clearing a criminal by means of an alibi. Four men, low shop keepers, properly schooled by him had made oath to having seen the criminal and been with him at the very time he was charged with having committed the offence for which he was arraigned. This testimony was received, and the criminal was acquitted. The fellow with the four false witnesses, had just been in to pay their benefactor a call and report their success; for securing which he received two hundred dollars. This money now lay on the table by him exposed, as he used to expose his silver, for though he loved money and had forged deeds to enrich himself, yet he was careless of taking care of it as if it 4 possessed no value. He was in high good-humor at the success of his alibi, and every now and then would wreathe his large under lip into a smile of satisfaction as he thought of it. He went on reading the paper by the light of a tallow candle, for it was an hour after dark, when suddenly a deep exclamation burst from him in the form of an oath, such an execration as a bad man gives vent to on an occasion of sudden surprise and pleasure. He sprung from his chair, made a gesture with his arm as if excited, then sat down again and fixed his eyes intensely once more upon the paragraph, which had so suddenly changed his whole manner. It was as follows: “We learn with pleasure, that the Rev. Mr. Edward Manning has accepted the charge of — church in this city. Mr. Manning is a young clergyman of great promise, commanding talents and deep piety. His mind is of the highest order and accurately cultivated, and few clerical gentlemen of the day surpass him in elequence. He is a son of Judge Manning, and possesses his father's fine talents as well as his excellencies of character. We congratulate his parishioners upon their acquisition.” “There is my man!” exclaimed Satchell with emphasis, his face darkening while his eyes lighted up with the ball-fires of settled hatred. “That is my man! I will strike at the father through the son! No men are so open to calumny as the clergy! The least breath that stirs not the hair upon the heads of those of other professions, will be to them the sirocco blast, withering and fatal. The hour of my joy has come at last! The mode of my revenge is fixed! What good friend directed my eyes to this paragraph, and then suggested, as it were by a flash of lightning, the scheme of vengeance. Like Minerva, the thought has been brought forth full armed and mature. I see it in all its bearings. My mind grasps all its features. She who so madly loves him will aid me heart and soul! Success is certain! My triumph will be complete Were he other than a young clergyman I should hesitate! But a man of God is vulnerable at all points. He is like a sensitive plant that the least touch will cause to shrink. What happy thought wrought this mode of vengeance into my brain. Eleven long years have I been planning revenge against George Manning, and now, all in an instant, as by inspiration, I have the mode before me! I can reach him through his son! I know he is attached to that young man, who is his only child, and to whom he will leave his fortune. I know that he loves him with all a father's love, and is proud of him with all a father's pride! My revenge is at hand! Blessed little paragraph!” He rose up and walked his room. His face was dropped towards the floor as he paced to and fro in deep thought. His brows were knitted and his whole manner that of a man who was mentally planning some deep purpose. At length he threw himself into his chair again, sat a few minutes with his hand upon his forehead as if collecting his thoughts to a focus, and then wrote a few lines, sealed and directed the note, took his hat and cane and hastily left his room, locking the door behind him and putting the key into his pocket. Upon reaching the alley he turned to the left, crossed Cornhill, descended through a steep passage by a flight of stone stairs and emerged upon Brattle street. The night was very dark and cloudy, but he found his way by the glimmer of the few far apart lamps in that neighborhood, and moved along as rapidly as in noon-day. Reaching Hanover street he crossed it a few rods down and entered an obscure side street, in which stood a few old fashioned dwelling houses, with large elms in the yards. Before one of these mansions he stopped and opening the heavy gate walked up a short, paved walk to the front door which stood under a portico. The house had a respectable, ancient aspect, and looked as if in olden times it had been the abode of one of the first families of the town. It was three stories in height; the cornice and architrome were elaborately moulded and enclosed a carved frieze. The yard was spacious, and contained, besides two noble trees of great age, several flowering shrubs and plants encircling a walk within the fence. In the rear of a paved yard, stood with an imposing front a range of stables and out-houses. Over the gate-way was a lamp-frame, but the lamp was not a light; but from the windows on the left shone through the foliage of a jessamine the rays of a candle within. The lawyer knocked at the door but once only, lifting its heavy brazen knocker in the shape of a lion's claw. It was opened after a few moments by an African girl, with a remarkably black complexion, setting off features of singular deformity even for one of her race. “Is your master at home?” “Yes,” she replied as if recognizing Satchell, but still holding the door very close. “Tell him I wish to see him!” as he spoke he pushed in by her and stood in the large hall. She went into the room on the left, and in a moment returned, saying, “Yiss, master say you pleas come in!” The lawyer, who had been impatiently glancing his eyes round upon the architectural ornaments of the cornice and bannisters of a spacious stair case, crossed to the door which she held open for him, and entered the room. The negress immediately closed it after him and returned to his kitchen where sat in tender waiting for her return, Handy, the musical Boot-Black, who, be it here recorded was her accepted lover, and she the “Rose” of his amorous ditty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. THE VICTIM. The apartment into which the lawyer was ushered by the negress was a large, square, old-fashioned parlor with high wainscoatings, deep cornices and pilasters above the mantel-piece supporting an arch, upon which reclined a Bacchus upon a couch of carved grapes. The furniture of the room was as old-fashioned as the architecture, consisting of half a dozen black high-backed chairs with open-work backs in wood, and seats of faded needle-work; a sofa covered with flowered chintz, a mahogany beufort, three or four ancient pictures in large oval frames, and polished mahogany tables almost of an ebony color with oval leaves. These were placed against the sides of the room one opposite the other, with a mirror in a heavy elaborate gilt frame suspended above each. At one of these tables, that which was on the left of the door by which Satchell entered and between the two front windows, stood a gentleman who had just risen from a chair by it to receive him. There stood a tall wax candle upon the table in a very tall silver candle-stand, and by its light the features and person of the gentleman were visible. He was in height nearly six feet, very noble in the breadth of chest, and with an air and carriage of the head singularly imposing. His head was finely shaped, the features regular and handsome, and his hair which was nearly white was worn long upon the temples and adown the neck. His age could not have been more than fifty, for his face was unwrinkled and his form vigorous. He wore a dark brown dressing-gown and a white vest with gilt buttons set closely together; a finely plaited ruffle adorned the bosom of his shirt, in which was pinned a small jet cross. His hand was very white and small. His countenance looked troubled, as if the visit was untimely or the visitor unwelcome. He nevertheless assumed a smile as Satchell entered, a sickly, sad smile, and advanced a step towards him but without extending his hand, like a man who felt compelled to receive his guest with courtesy, yet resolved not to yield more towards him than was absolutely necessary. “Good evening, Mr. Satchell,” he said, with embarrassment and a constrained air; and, as we have said, he bowed politely but did not extend his hand. Perhaps he was aware of Satchell's principle never to shake hands with any man. But a close observer would have set down the omission to instinctive repugnance to the man. “Good evening, Colonel Harwood,” said Satchell, in a bland and social manner unusual to him. “Be seated, sir. To what favorable circumstance am I to owe this visit to me, sir?” added Colonel Harwood, as Satchell took a chair by the side of the table, so that the candle stood between him and his host, who had also reseated himself. This question was asked in a hesitating manner. Indeed his whole bearing was like that of a man who feels himself in the power of another. “To circumstances that affect me more than yourself, Colonel Harwood.” “I trust that you have come to inform me that you have, at length, decided to accept of my offer for the correspondence, and thus relieve my mind of a most painful source of anxiety.” “You proposed to give me—” “Five thousand dollars in money down, sir, for the papers,” answered Colonel Harwood, with great earnestness. “I am as ready to repeat the offer as I was to make it last Thursday when I saw you in your office.” “I cannot take that sum, Colonel Harwood,” answered Satchell, quietly. “Then why are you here, sir? Do you come to feast your eyes upon your victim? Do you delight to gloat upon him whom a word from you will arraign before the tribunal of his country for high treason?” “No, that is not my pastime, sir. I have you in my power, it is true, but I do not wish to take any undue advantage of it.” “Pray, sir, what do you call undue advantage? You have set the price of those papers, which is the price of my life and honor, to the very last dollar I am worth in the world.” “I know that, sir. I know exactly how much you can pay me without utter ruin. To that outside limit have I set my price.” “And I have offered it to you. I offered it to you when last we had our interview. You then said you would give me an answer in a week. But three days before the week expires I see you voluntarily at my house. Have I not just reason to hope that you have called to close with my offer?” “It is true that my object in visiting you to-night and at this late hour, Colonel Harwood, touches the affair of the treasonable papers. But I have not come to accept the five thousand dollars.” “You have not? Then what in the devil, sir, have you called upon me for? I will remind you, Mr. Satchell, that there is a limit to all human patience and forbearance. I will hint to you that you may overshoot your mark, and by aiming too high lose all. I already begin to think that I had better defy you at once to do your worst, and take the infamy that will follow.” “You have your option, sir,” coolly replied Satchell. “Will you drive me mad, sir? I have not my option. I cannot, you know I cannot bear to be held up to the eyes of my country and the world as a traitor. You know, sir, that I have too keen a sense of honor,—that I will die first.” “I know it, sir. I know that you would give me not only all to the last cent you are worth, but that you would kneel and lick my hand rather than be thus dishonored.” “I would not, sir. I would blow out my brains before I would thus demean myself. Yet, God knows I would do much for my dear family's sake to avert the disgrace. Oh, what fiend possessed the man to single you out as the agent of his revenge!” “Because revenge is sweet, sir. He knew me, and he knew that I would see that the whole talley was scored. I paid him his price for the papers. I hold them, sir, to your confusion, and to my profit. Hear me, Colonel Harwood. In purchasing these papers from the deserter whom you so severely punished, I intended only to make out of them, through your fears, a pecuniary gain. When I called upon you three months ago and told you that I had these papers, and convinced you too that I had them, by showing you one of the letters in your own hand-writing to the British General, you offered me promptly one thousand dollars for them. This I refused, giving you a month to do better. At the end of a week you came and doubled the offer. This I refused, and the next week you increased your offer. But I knew the power I possessed, and resolved to make the affair in hand a source of profit. So I took measures to ascertain just how much blood you could bear letting, that is, how much you were worth. I then laid my maximum at five thousand dollars.” “And this I offered you, but you hesitated.” “Because I did not wish to resign my power at once, and I hoped to be able to get something more.” “Sir, you are a monster!” “You have tried your tongue before at calling bad names, Colonel, but you see that I don't mind them. They are but breath,— they can't hurt me. I laugh, having the game.” “Will you tell me, sir, why you are here to-night?” “I will. I began to do so, but you have interrupted me.” “You need not expect me to give you one dollar over what I have offered you. It will beggar me and my family to do this. I will blow out my brains and end the matter before I oblige you any farther.” “Colonel, I am your friend. If any other man had got possession of this correspondence, in which you offer to surrender an important fortress to the British during the war, they would not have thought of making money out of it, but would at once have published it to the world, and by this time you would have had the honor of dying twelve feet distant from a dozen muskets loaded with ball. But I came to you in a friendly way, and offered for a consideration, (money for honor and life,) to surrender the mischievous papers into your hands. Had your friend, Judge Manning, got the papers into his hands, believe me he would have communicated them to the Government. As a man of honor he would have felt himself bound to do so; and so to a sense of duty he would have sacrificed friendship. An enemy to you would have made a similar use of them. But I come to you and propose a compromise. What could be more suited to your views and wishes?” “I do not find fault with you. What you say is very likely to have proved true. I had rather they had fallen into your hands than in those of friend or foe. Will you surrender them to me for five thousand dollars?” `No, not for money,” he answered with emphasis. “How, then? If not for money, in what manner?” demanded the Colonel with amazement. “I will tell you,” replied Satchell, reaching out and moving the candle a little nearer Colonel Harwood, as if he would darken his own features and lighten up his more fully while he addressed him, at the same time he looked carefully about the room to see that the doors were all closed. `Pray, do tell me?” cried Colonel Harwood. “Indeed I am unable to guess what you mean. Not money?” “Not money. Circumstances have led me to change my resolution. Money is as valuable to me perhaps as to most men. But it is not money.” Colonel Harwood looked perplexed and distressed as much at the manner as the words of Satchell. If it was not money he feared, he knew not what. Something indefinable, more dreadful than impoverishing him. What could it be? But he did not put the question. He waited in painful silence until Satchell should explain his meaning. “There are in this world some things, Colonel Harwood, more valuable to a man than honor,” said Satchell, in a grave manner; “for instance your honor is dearer to you than money.” “It is.” “Revenge is often dearer to men than money. It may not be so to you, but it is to me.” Here Satchell paused and seemed to be uncertain how to go on. Colonel Harwood regarded him in pale silence. “A man sometimes considers fame, which is a breath, dearer than money,” resumed Satchell. “Others love.” “Well, sir,” observed or rather interlocuted Colonel Harwood, hardly knowing what to say, but seeing that he paused and gazed on him, he said—“Well, sir.” He was more and more perplexed to guess how this would end. “Love,” remarked Satchell, with emphasis upon the word,— “love, as I said, men often, very often, regard as more valuable than silver and gold.” “Yes, I believe so.” “I know so, Colonel Harwood. To speak more to the point, I feel that it is so. For instance, I can by giving you the papers which like a cloud hangs over your life, this very night receive from you all your estate.” “Five thousand dollars, Mr. Satchell. This was my proposal.” “You would give me all your estate, and you know it. You would beggar yourself to have in your power the secret which I hold. So do not interrupt me if you please, Colonel. I repeat that your fortune is at my command, on condition that I surrender to you the papers. But I have come here to-night ready to surrender them to you, and take nothing from you—not a dollar.” “Give them to me!” exclaimed Colonel Harwood, with a cheek glowing with hope and joy, yet his eye wavering with doubt and incredulity. “Not give them, Colonel. I shall expect in return a value equal to the proposal you offered. What I ask I am willing to take in lieu of the money, for it will be as valuable to me. To you it may not be so.” “What do you speak of? You are inexplicable.” “I will be clearer then. Be calm and take what you hear composedly. Nothing can be gained by excited words and loss of equanimity. I have no doubt when you think upon my terms you will embrace them. It will be better for you to do so, than to impoverish your wife and five lovely children. I have hinted to your that men have held love to be as valuable as gold. It is so in my estimation. You have, Colonel Harwood, a lovely daughter, born out of wedlock, if rumor says true. I am willing to take her instead of the five thousand dollars, and give you up the papers.” Colonel Harwood grew as pale as the face of the dead when he named his daughter. Alarm, surprise, anger struggled in his countenance. The quick blood rushed to his brows. He gazed upon the speaker with trembling lips. “How do you know she is my daughter?” “I discovered it by accident. With the world she passes as your niece. It is on your tongue to assert to me that she is your niece. You need not. I know she is your daughter, born two years before you wedded your present wife. I know she is your daughter, though you have not educated her at home, and now, although she is at the age of nineteen, you keep her boarded at a boarding-school, on the plea that she is to learn French and Music, and finish her education. In the meanwhile you are looking out for a suitable match for her. I am here ready to take her off your hands. Consent to use your influence with her to marry me, and the papers are yours if you succeed. Otherwise, you shall have them at no price! I will communicate them to the Government, and fill your cup to the brim by acquainting your daughter with the stain upon her birth, and making known to your wife that she is not your niece.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. THE SACRIFICE. The amazement and terror depicted on the countenance of Colonel Harwood it would be impossible to describe. He fixed his eyes upon the countenance of Satchell with that look of horrified hatred and impotency with which he would regard a demon. Satchell met his look with an expression cool, deliberate indifference and conscious power. From horror the face of his victim assumed an aspect of the most painful, pitiable, distressing supplication. As pale as marble and with a trembling tongue Colonel Harwood bent towards him. For a moment he looked as if he would sink from his chair to his knees and thus realize Satchell's assertion. But he did not kneel, with his knees, but it was plain that he did so with his spirit. Humiliation and the most imploring deprecation marked his manner. “Mr. Satchell, my good friend, Mr. Satchell!” he gasped. He tried to say more but his emotions checked his utterance. With his hands clasped together he stretched forth his face and neck towards him as if begging for life. “Well, Colonel Harwood!” answered Satchell, who could not look upon him without wonder at his agitation. “You seem to be alarmed! I have proposed nothing that should produce in you such horror and fear. I am a man and not a monster. I shall make your daughter a good husband! Think of it calmly sir. Five thousand dollars and poverty or your daughter to me and your present competence. Nay, I repeat that I will give you the papers for no other price than your daughter's hand!” “You shall not have it!” gasped the Colonel faintly. “Very well, you shall not have the papers,” responded Satchell preparing to rise from his seat. “To-morrow I shall transmit them to the government. Let the evil be on your own head!” “Stay, sir, stay. I will talk with you calmly.” “It were best to do so!” “Will you inform me how you learned the fact that Caroline Kent is my daughter?” “It matters not. It was by accident in the way of my business in looking up old papers. Let it suffice that I know the fact!” “You seem to be my evil genius. You have me in your power in every way. Sir, you will drive me mad! I shall take my life!” “I do not fear it. There is no difficulty so great that man cannot overcome it with nerve. There is not a madman who has let his reason fly in reverses, who if he had guarded it with equanimity might have arisen out of his troubles. There is not a suicide who if he had lived might not have redeemed fortune and character. While there is life all things are possible to a man. None but cowards die and go mad! Listen to me with composure. Hear the whole matter between us. I hold treasonable papers written by you to the enemy that are snifficient to hang you. I offer them to you for your daughter's hand! That daughter passes to the world as your niece. Your wife believes her to be your niece, the daughter of a sister who died years ago in Brazil, at the consulate of her husband. But you know and I know that sister died childless!” “You seem to be in league with Lucifer!” “I have not the honor of this shadowy gentleman's acquaintance. I find devils enough in the world without going into hell after such fanciful acquaintances. I propose that you give me your daughter for your honor. I threaten if you refuse not only to place the papers at the disposal of the government at Washington, but to divulge both to your daughter and to your wife the secret you have so carefully guarded. Now, Colonel Harwood you have the whole matter plainly presented. The hour grows late,” added Satchell, looking at his huge silver watch, “I should like a reply at once!” “At once?” repeated his distressed victim. “Yes, Colonel Harwood. You can decide now as well as at another time. You know at this moment as well as tomorrow whether you will consent for me to mail the treasonable papers to Washington in the morning.” “I—I—need a little while to think of it.” “I will give you five minutes by my watch.” “Sir, my daughter is very beautiful,” he said with emotion. “I know it, sir.” “She is young, scarcely nineteen, accomplished with every grace, and I dearly love her. To me she is also fondly attached.” “As my wife you can still love her—she fondly loves you. I wish to break no ties of affection.” “But consider the disparity Mr. Satchell. You are at least forty-eight and —” “Ugly as she is lovely, I dare say.” “No I did not say so. But, Mr. Satchell, suppose you have my consent. You cannot have hers.” “How do you know?” “I cannot think that she would consent to marry you without compulsion.” “We can't tell what a young woman will do. Matches, with more disparity of ages have often taken place.” “But she has never seen you.” “No, perhaps not.” “There is an insuperable objection, if I must speak my mind, Mr. Satchell,” said Colonel Harwood, coloring. “Speak freely.” “Your character among men. You know, sir, that you are a disgraced man. That you hold no enviable position in the opinion of the world.” “I understand you. I am the Rogue's lawyer.” But, sir, your daughter is a natural child. So that it is a fair offset. No honorable man would wed her. She must either be the wife of a man who cares little for the opinions and prejudices of society, or else —” “Else what, sir.” “Else some honorable man's mistress.” “Villain!” “Keep your temper, Colonel. I speak out what you think but dare not utter; what the world would both think and say, if they knew the truth. It remains for you to choose what you will do.” “I did not intend that the secret of her birth should ever transpire, sir. It was my intention to marry her to some suitable person as my daughter. This I could now do.” “No sir, you cannot. If you refuse her to me, she shall know the secret. And should she keep it and marry an honest gentleman I would betray the truth to him. Sir, there is no use in farther prolonging this interview.” “It is quite as unpleasant to me as it can be to you,” said the poor man, the sweat standing in drops upon his brow. “But I can't let you leave without arranging upon some plan for possession of those damning proofs of treason you hold against me.” “You know my price,” responded Satchell with the most provoking firmness. Colonel Harwood rose from his chair and walked once across the apartment and back again, slowly and thoughtfully. His countenance was destitute of all color save ashy paleness. He seemed possessed with the deepest anguish. He presented the painful spectacle of one man in the moral power of his fellow, and that fellow-being without mercy, principle or justice. Stopping in front of the man who had his destiny and that of his beloved wife and children in his hands, he said, in a voice that seemed to come from the sepulchre, it sounded so hollow and deep,— “Mr. Satchell, I yield. Take her if she will consent to be yours. But mark me, sir. I shall not lift a finger towards compelling her. So far as I am concerned, I give my consent that she shall be your wife. I will use no influence either one way or the other. Now that the secret of her birth, which I thought was sealed forever in my own bosom, is revealed, I give up my hopes for her. What you have said respecting her is too true. I would rather, if it must be, that she were even wedded to you than become that you suggest. Yet, I do not know that I would. Once for all, I say take her, if she will take you. I make this sacrifice not to save the five thousand dollars, for I will give it to you now instead, but to save the anguish and infamy my dishonor will bring upon my family.” “I refuse money, Colonel Harwood.” “I know it. I see that it is useless for me to struggle against my fate. Give me the papers and take her. But remember, sir, that I am not to be responsible if she refuses you.” “That is understood. I will not hold you responsible. But I shall expect you to see her to-morrow, and make known to her that it is necessary for your safety and honor that she should become my wife.” “I will do it, sir,” gasped Mr. Harwood. “You will after seeing her call at my office and let me know that you have done it, and then write me a note introducing me to her as her future husband.” “I will do it, sir,” he articulated faintly. “I will then place in your hands the papers that so nearly touch your life and honor and happiness.” “Once they are in my possession, I shall drop on my knees and devoutly thank God.” “You will have reason to, sir; for though seven years have elapsed since the peace of 1815, yet treason is never out-lawed by statute, unless by special enactment. The fall of the fortress you commanded, though apparently an accident of war, was, you well know, brought about by your treasonable understanding with the enemy. This the letters and plans in my possession clearly prove; but so artfully did you manage that although the country were surprised at the surrender, when it was supposed the place was impregnable, yet no suspicion, beyond mere expressions of astonishment, fell upon you.” “Do not speak of it, sir.” “I do not wish to further. It is understood that you see your daughter to-morrow.” “Yes.” “When shall I see you at my office?” “At two o'clock.” “Earlier, if possible, as I have an engagement at that hour.” “Then at twelve.” “I will be there in waiting.” “And to deliver to me the papers?” “All of them.” “It will be a happy hour. But, Mr. Satchell, I must express my surprise at your willingness to surrender the papers upon my mere consent to give you my daughter. Is it possible you have already seen her and know that she will marry you?” “No, sir, I have not seen her.” “Then you must have great confidence in my influence over her, or else great faith in your power of persuasion; for remember, sir, there shall be no force used. Though I am in your power, and would sacrifice much, very much to free myself, yet I will be no party to coercion where my child is concerned. Dare, sir, to lay a hand upon her in sternness and I will take your life! I have not yet forgotten how to use a sword.” Satchell smiled, and said, rising from his chair,— “Colonel, do not let us quarrel now, we have brought matters to so favorable a crisis. I have no intention of using coercion. If she does not comply willingly, then you are released from all responsibility. But remember that if you dare to use a word to urge her to refuse, I will divulge to her the secret of her birth.” “The knowledge of it will scarce degrade her if she becomes your wife. She will think it a lesser evil.” “I am a philosopher. Your words do not, cannot anger me, Colonel. Now we understand one another? Tomorrow at twelve?” “Yes.” “Good night, sir.” The response of Colonel Harwood was scarcely heard; it moved the lips but did not stir the air. Indeed he seemed scarcely able to speak at all. He took the candle and showed his visitor to the outer door. He closed it after him, and then staggered through the hall to re-enter the room. Before he crossed the threshold of the sitting-room door he fell forward, the light flew far from his hand, and he lay upon his face nearly insensible and in darkness. Poor man! poor, erring, unhappy gentleman! How bitterly was retribution coming upon him for youthful excesses, and for the treason of riper years! He was not wholly insensible; he was conscious of his misery, and from time to time groaned heavily. He was completely overcome by the scene he had passed through. His heart was in that child! that beautiful, spirited, loving girl, who owed to him life, but life with dishonor. He loved her more for the wrong he felt he had done her. Sacredly for her sake he kept the secret of her birth. Since that event he had become a husband and a father. New affections, new bonds of love were fastened about his heart; yet he loved most the child of his first erring passion. He lavished upon her all that could make her happy, that could render her an ornament to that society in which he looked forward to see her more worshipped and caressed. But now all his hopes had perished; at one fell swoop they had been swept away! “Oh God!” he moaned in the silence and darkness where he lay, “my punishment is greater than I can bear. Who could have told this fearful, evil man this? But it is known. I must abide the fate that is before me. Life, honor, happiness, hers and mine, all are cast into the scale, and she only can turn it and save me. I will see her to-morrow; I will throw myself upon her mercy. I will tell her all,—all that I dare to tell her. From my lips she shall never know that I am her father.” Such were the thoughts, some of them uttered in broken words, that passed through his mind. Slowly he rose to his feet, found his way to the sofa, and sunk upon it powerless with grief.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. THE CONFESSION. The reader will perhaps by this time be inquisitive to know how the proposed union of Satchell with the daughter of his victim, was to contribute to his plan of revenge against Judge Manning in the person of his son; or why he should forego a certainty of five thousand dollars with the mere prospect, and an uncertain one, of winning the hand of the maiden. But these things will be made clear in the progress of the story, and Satchell shown to be perfectly consistent with himself. The ensuing morning Colonel Harwood rose, pale and haggard, after a sleepless night. To the inquiries and anxious solicitude of his wife and four sweet children, his eldest, a lad of sixteen, being a midshipman in the Navy and at sea, he replied cheerfully and with a forced smile that he was well. Soon after breakfast he went out, and took his way up Hanover street in the direction of Tremont. He came in front of a large, handsome edifice, standing back some distance from the street. A spacious lawn stretched in front, shaded with a number of stately sycamores. It was just nine o'clock, and as he stood by the spacious arched gateway to the mansion, troops of young girls passed him and went in, some with books in their hands busily studying their morning lesson, others affectionately locked arm in arm like twin flowers, and lovingly whispering as they slowly stepped along; others romping and laughing, and filling the air with music that enlivened that of the birds in the branches of the trees above their heads. Several of them smiled, and prettily and respectively spoke to him as they passed, for they had seen him often come there to visit his “niece,” the beautiful Carolina, or Linny Kent, as they called her, with school-girl-like change of her name. As they passed in and their bright happy faces flitted past him, he sighed at the contrast with his own wretchedness. “Good morning, Colonel Harwood,” said a pair of blooming girls of seventeen or eighteen, one of them with her sun-hat carelessly hanging back over her shoulders, and her cheeks rich with the hue of health and tone of beauty. “Good day, Fanny, good day, Miss Kate,” responded the Colonel, his face in spite of his sorrows reflecting their smile. “You are just the person above all others, dear Colonel,” cried Kate, laying her white hand on his arm; “we are going to Jamaica Plains this afternoon, and Linny must go. Will you let her?” “Yes, Colonel, don't refuse,” cried the other, gracefully swinging her straw hat by the string wound about her fore-finger. “There is uncle John, and both of aunt, and father and cousin Dick going, and we must have Linny.” “I am sorry to say that she is engaged to-day,” answered the Colonel, almost suffocating with emotion. The tears came into his eyes and they saw them. “You are ill, sir,” she said sympathizingly. “I thought you looked ill.” “I am not well.” “How sorry Caroline will be,” said Kate, looking sadly herself. “It is nothing. I shall feel better by and by.” “I hope so, sir,” answered Fanny, with that tone of gentle sympathy that renders a lovely girl, when pity is moving her young and pure heart, so like an angel. As they conversed they slowly approached the noble villa-like mansion, which was occupied as a boarding-school. “I will run in and tell Caro you are here, sir,” cried Kate; and she bounded forward up the steps and disappeared in the hall. In a small but elegant chamber on the south side of the house sat a young girl of nineteen. She was writing off music for a guitar which leaned against the table. Upon the table stood a vase of fresh flowers with the dew upon them, the fragrance of which combined with that from some blooming plants in the window filled the apartment. Every article of furniture betrayed the taste and accomplishments of the fair occupants. Costly annuals, drawings, paintings from her own pencil, French and Italian poets, a guitar, a harp,—all bore testimony to the elegant cultivation of the presiding mind. The maiden, who was Caroline Kent, the natural daughter of Colonel Harwood, was a brunette, but of the most delicate tone of complexion. Her figure though slight was developed with that chaste voluptuousness of contour which Raphæl loved to portray in his beautiful women. She was dressed in a white morning robe, which displayed the fine outline of her faultless shoulders with charming effect. Her arm and hand were of admirable beauty for shape and whiteness and for the rosy loveliness of the finger-tips. Her face was oval, like the faces of Venician maidens, and her eye-brows dark and pencilled like those of a daughter of Araby. Beneath them were eyes that in the pride and glory of their splendor it was dangerous to look upon, much more to gaze into. They were large, exceedingly dark and eloquently expressive of a soul full of strong passion and deep feeling. They would now expand with animation, now fall with softened power, the long dark lashes letting the eyes beam through them like midnight stars seen through the shadowy trees. Their expression was now grave, and perhaps a shade of sadness dwelt about her beautiful mouth. Upon it she had just laid her fore-finger as if to listen, and raised her eyes from the music she was copying, with an air of attention, when her door was assailed by a noisy rap. “Come in,” she answered in a rich-keyed voice, that once heard would linger upon the ear and live in the memory like music. The door opened, and the little maiden “Kate,” we don't know who, bounded in, yet with an air of deference, for Caroline Kent was her senior by a couple of years. Her face, however, was sparkling with her news. “Your uncle has come, Linny, and is in the hall.” “I was listening as you came to the door, for I thought I heard his voice. You are very kind to come and tell me.” She laid the pen down, and rose with a glad look to go and meet him. “He looks ill, but he says it is nothing,” said Kate, as they went out. “But I shouldn't wonder as it is Wednesday if he came to take you home. I asked him if you might go with us to Jamaica Plains, and he said you were engaged. Did you know it?” They had now reached the hall. “No, indeed,” she answered, smiling. She then saw Colonel Harwood. “My dear uncle!” she cried, almost embracing him in the presence of the others. “You have been four days away. You do look pale! I hope you are not sick, sir?” “It is nothing, Caro.” “Will you walk into the drawing-room or up stairs into my room?” “I will go up stairs. But have you no recitation?” “No. I have pretty much my own hours now. Madame Delano scarcely looks upon me as a pupil. I wish you had come to say that you had decided to let me make it my home with you. I am getting to be quite a venerable pupil, sir, at nineteen.” She looked at him with solicitude, as she saw that his eyes did not reflect the smile that sparkled in her own while she spoke. “We will go up stairs to your room.” he said, with agitation that he tried in vain to conceal. She saw that something painful was upon his mind, and without asking any questions she preceded him to her room. After he had taken a chair and she had seated herself by him, he for some moments sat with his brow resting upon his hand in silence. She regarded him with deep concern. Taking up her guitar she struck a few chords, and said,— “Shall I sing, dear uncle? You are sad, and music always soothes and cheers.” “No, my child, I can't bear it now. I shall be composed soon.” “What has occurred?” she asked, laying her hand gently upon his arm. “Something distresses you. What concerns you is of the deepest interest to me. You know, my dear uncle, that I know no difference between you and a father. As a father you have always been to me. From me you have a child's love and gratitude!” she kissed him affectionately as she said this. Every word she uttered pierced his heart. “I will, if I can, tell you what weighs upon my mind, my dear niece,” he said, more composed. “You need not be told how much my heart is wrapped up in you. You are indeed to me as my own child. But I fear you will cease to love me. I fear you will hate me when you hear what I have to say.” “I cannot hate you. Do not talk thus!” she cried with emotion. “What is the meaning of this mystery in your words and looks!” “You must hear. I will not torture you with suspense. Listen to me, my child.” He took her hand in his, and after an effort to command his feelings he thus began, while she listened with the deepest and at times the most painful attention. “You are aware, my dear niece, that during the last war with Great Britain I was placed in command of a fortress on Lake —.” “I know it, sir. It was when you were taken prisoner, being compelled to surrender to the enemy.” “Yes,” he answered with a faint affirmative. “Now learn my dishonor from my own lips.” “No one can couple your name with dishonor,” she cried, with the indignant sensibility of that quick affection which scorns the thought of infamy touching a loved name. “It is a painful task I have to do to reverse your opinion of me, dear Caroline. But there are mitigating circumstances. The command of fort — was given to me to maintain against the forces of General Leslie which were investing it. I knew General Leslie intimately. When I was to Eton school in England we were classmates and as intimate as twin brothers. That intimacy continued through the university so unbroken, that we were called by our friends Damon and Pythias. The designation was prophetic, as you will see. A few days after I was to leave Oxford and England, I was involved in a duel with an unprincipled party, who used foul play and would have assassinated me but for Leslie's presence of mind. I owed my life to his presence and decision. Twice before I had saved his life. When I left Oxford to go to Portsmouth to embark for the United States, he accompanied me to that port. When we parted we swore eternal friendship. I pledged myself never to refuse any favor he should ask of me, and he on his part made the same pledge. “This was many years before the war broke out between our respective governments. I drew the sword for my country and took the field. He had previously entered the army, and the last year of the war a regiment was given him. The command of fort — was bestowed upon me when it was threatened by his forces; for after his arrival in America he was made a Brigadier General, and menaced at the head of eighteen hundred men the position I held. We were in all four hundred and eighty men, our position strong, we had plenty of water, provisions, and ammunition to stand a six months' siege. “Yet the place fell into General Leslie's hands, sir, if I recollect right, on the tenth day after he came before it.” “Yes,” answered Colonel Harwood, with a deep sigh. “The evening of the first day a flag of truce was sent to the fortress from the British army. I received it. The bearer, a captain, handed 5 me a sealed letter, marked `Private, C. L.' I knew the initials to be those of my friend. I retired to my quarters and opening it, read as follows: “`My dear Harwood,—I regret as much as you can that our second meeting should be in the attitude of foes. At heart we are friends, at least I answer for my own heart. I do not mistrust you. I am commanded by the General-in-chief to take the fortress you hold, if at the sacrifice of every man in my three regiments. The fortress must fall sooner or later. The American armies have enough to employ them, without weakening their operations by coming to your aid. Now is the time for you to redeem your pledge to me. I call upon you to surrender the fortress to me in the spirit of this pledge. I am sincere. Had you anticipated me, and first sent to me to retire from the fortress I should have obeyed. What less can you do? Let me hear whether your friendship bears the test that I now apply to it! The surrender can be made without affecting your honor. It shall be as if by the chance of war. Send me a plan of all the approaches and the position of the aqueduct by which water is supplied from the lake, and I will cut off the water and manage to get my men within your posts by means of your plan, so that there will be no alternative between surrender or carnage. Let me have a line from you whether I can trust to you to fulfil your pledge.”' “And did you listen to him, uncle?” cried Caroline, with fear and trembling, her eyes at the same time expressing by their fire her strong feeling of resentment at the unblushing audacity of the demand. “Surely you will say you shunned the application which was as insulting to you as dishonorable to him.” “Would to God I had done so, Caroline! No, I listened. I thought more of my personal honor with a man who was now my national foe, than of my country's welfare or of my national honor. I replied to him that I was ready to redeem my pledge.” “And did you not feel that he was unworthy of your friendship, thus to demand its fulfilment?” “I did not then; I did afterwards, as you shall hear. I replied to his letter, and he again to mine. A secret correspondence was kept up between us for three days. I wrote him at least fifteen letters, and also sent him in sealed packages plans of all the approaches to the fort, and information where he could cut off the supply of water.” “Oh! uncle, what treachery! what infamy and dishonor!” she cried, covering her face with her hands. “I shall not be surprised if you curse me.” “Were you mad, sir? Had you your reason, sir?” she earnestly demanded, fixing upon him her rigid gaze. “I was blinded by a romantic, mad notion of friendship. I defended my conduct by recollecting the devotion of Damon and Pythias.” “But Damon only risked life; you honor!” “Do not sharpen by your cutting words the bitter anguish of my soul,” he cried with emotion. “Listen and hear all, and then if you scorn me I shall feel that I deserve not only your contempt, but that of every honest man.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. THE FATHER AND NIECE. Colonel Harwood, after a few moment's silence to control his feelings, thus resumed his narrative to his daughter:— “The negociations between us continued as I have said for three days, at the expiration of which time General Leslie had possession of all the information necessary for him to take possession of the fortress. His first act was to cut off the supply of water. At the end of three days more the garrison was in the utmost distress for want of water, and all ignorant of the cause which prevented its flow into the fortress as formerly. Taking advantage of this distress, General Leslie made his approaches night after night nearer and nearer the walls where they were weakest, as I had pointed out to him in my plans. At length on the night of the tenth day a general attack was made, and the garrison finding resistance madness, with the enemy five times their number within the defences, yielded without striking a blow. I and a few of my officers made a stand until we were taken prisoners. The resistance of my officers was real; that on my part only feigned.” “Oh! my dear, wretched uncle!” “Do not yet condemn me. I was under an illusion of madness, I verily believe. I became General Leslie's prisoner. No one suspected my agency in the fall of the fortress. No one could have expected us to hold out, with our daily supply of water cut off. Not a breath censured me. It was `the fortune of war,' so called.” “Oh, what treachery!” muttered the young girl, in the low tone of deep amazement and indignation. “Hear me to the end,” continued Colonel Harwood, looking as if he would sink under her proud glance of scornful surprise. “I was not wholly lost. I was soon awakened to a full sense of my folly and madness by the conduct of Leslie himself. The day after the surrender I had made of the fortress, and also of my honor, he invited me to dine with him alone. After dinner we were walking in a grove, when he discovered to me as we conversed the falsity of his true character. Said he to me,— “`Harwood, do you know that I had not the least idea you would treat my proposition, for you to give up the fort in accordance to the terms of our old pledge, with seriousness; much more go to work so systematically.' He then laughed as if laughing at my weakness. “`Would you not have done so?' I asked with surprise. “`I? no, no. I am not quite so Quixotic, my dear Harwood! My King and country and national honor I always put before private friendship. Nevertheless, I am under the greatest obligations to you.' This was spoken coolly and with an insulting air. “`You are a villain!' I exclaimed. `I have been a fool; but I will do what I can to redeem my own self-respect. Draw and defend yourself?' “Although a prisoner I retained my sword. He wore his at his side. He stared at me to see if I was in earnest. I replied by pressing the point of my sword against his breast and calling upon him to defend his life. He turned deadly white but drew his sword, and endeavored to cut me down with the same motion as it flew out of its sheath. I parried at the thrust. We fought for a few seconds, and my sword passed through his body. He fell dead almost instantly. I looked around and seeing that the combat had not been witnessed, for we were together in a little clump of trees in the rear of his tent, I stooped down to search him for the letters which I had written to him. But they were not upon his person. I then took from his finger his signet ring, and hastening to the tent which I had to pass through to escape, I presented it to the sentinel in front, saying that I was going by permission of General Leslie. I was beyond the limits of the British camp and effected my escape to the American lines before the alarm was given.” “I have heard that General Leslie was slain, but it was supposed by an assassin who waylaid him. Could it have been by your hand that he fell?” “Yes, and in the manner stated. I was not suspected of having slain him, as no one knew that I had dined with him in private save his sentinel and servant; and when I went out with him after dinner it was to go to my own quarters, which lay in an opposite direction from the spot where he was found. My escape was attributed to the confusion caused by his death, as I was on parole to him only, and it was supposed that looking upon his death as a termination of the parole, that I resolved to leave the camp. From that hour to this I have never been suspected, save in one instance, of having been a traitor. In slaying the base Leslie I had removed the witness of my guilt. But he brought his death upon himself.” “And why, my dear uncle, have you unfolded to me all this painful story? Would to God you had kept the secret in your own breast! It overwhelms me with grief and fills my bosom with strange feelings towards you, that I would never had found place there. I would rather have died than known that one whom I believed the very mirror of honor, a proper pattern of an upright gentleman, a patriotic and brave soldier, should thus be proven to have fallen so low. How,—oh! how can I esteem you as I have done? I have loved you, because I believed you all that was good and noble. My dear uncle, this revelation almost breaks my heart. Oh! why have you revealed this to me?” “God knows I would have kept the secret forever sealed, Caroline.” “You were mad,—you were mad, sir, to listen to Leslie! Do I gaze on a traitor? Sir, if I had read in a book of history the story of an American officer who had thus betrayed his country, I should have scorned him. But I will not hate you, I cannot hate you, my dear uncle. I will forgive you.” “Will you?” he cried, with joyful emotion. “I will try to, I will try to forget. Oh, that I had never heard! My uncle, so beloved and honored, a traitor!” “Alas! you can neither forgive nor forget, though your heart prompts you to. Your proud spirit, Caroline, will bend your affection to it. I do not look for your love; and I fear that my object in unfolding to you this humiliating confession will not be attained; it is only to your love, your deep, faithful affection for me, that I look for success.” “Uncle, what can I do do for you? What is there that I can do that can weigh against this painful relation with which you preface your request?” “I dare not speak. You look coldly upon me.” “Nay, I will forget, my dear uncle. I love you still!” she cried, throwing her arms about him. “Though you have been false to your country, you have been true and good ever to me.” “Noble girl!” he cried, almost overcome with his grateful emotions. “Now let me hear what you wish me to do?” she said, with a winning smile; “though I cannot conceive what I have in my poor power to perform, that can parallel with the dreadful confession you have felt it necessary to make before asking me.” “I will, I must say what I came here to say, Caroline.” “Speak freely, sir,” she said, with frank sincerity. “The correspondence which passed between me and Leslie has come to light.” “How? I trembled for this.” “I do not know how. But every letter that I wrote to General Leslie, with all the plans enclosed and all the damning proofs of my treason, are in the hands of a man in this city.” “Then you are lost!” cried Caroline Kent, with almost a shriek. “I am glad that you fear for me and feel for me. It leads me to hope that you will resolve to save me.” “Save you! Can I save you?” “You can; it is in your power to make me a happy man; it is in your power, Caroline, to dissipate the horrible fears that for some weeks past have weighed upon my mind, and almost driven me to suicide.” “Speak, sir! I will do it.” “I ask of you no promise until you have heard what I require of you. The papers which are held by this person are in themselves sufficient to bring me to an ignominious death; to brand my name to the world with infamy; to destroy the hopes of my children; to cause the finger of scorn to be pointed at my dear boy, who is now in his country's service; in a word to wreck all that I am and all who have any connection with me.” “And how can this be averted? What can one so insignificant as I do, sir?” “You shall hear, though I would rather my tongue were paralyzed than it should utter the words. The man who holds these fatal papers is a lawyer, and though a person of extraordinary talents, a man wholly destitute of principle. You see I describe to you his character fairly, for you shall do nothing blindly; and in the end it depends upon you to refuse or assent. His name is Simmins Satchell.” “I have heard of him. I have seen him pass the gate. Once he looked at me so fixedly that I was alarmed, and inquired of one of the young girls who he was, and they said it was the person you have named. He looks to me, sir, like an evil man; his countenance was dark and sinister; his very glance which met mine made me shudder instinctively.” “And well it might, poor child, if you knew all. When did you see him?” asked Colonel Harwood, eagerly. “But ten days ago; it was as I was just coming in from a walk upon the common.” “He did not speak?” “No, sir; he looked at me in the most close and scrutinizing way, and with a boldness that offended me, while it excited alarm.” “Already prejudiced,” said the Colonel, in a half-tone to himself. “He has no hope; but I will do my duty, and the responsibility will remain with him. This Satchell,” resumed the Colonel, “came to me some weeks ago and desired an interview. He was then a perfect stranger to me. He made known to me that he had come to the knowledge that I had betrayed the fortress which had fallen into General Leslie's hands, and stated that he held the proofs in the correspondence which passed between us at the time. Judge my feelings! He refused to tell me how he came by it. At length he offered to place it at my disposal for a sum of money. I have offered him from time to time an amount that at length reached five thousand dollars,—all I am worth save the house I live in. Last week he gave me to understand that he would accept this sum. I hoped he would, for I was ready to make any sacrifice rather than be branded as a traitor.” “Yes, yes,” she said, with intense eagerness. “Last night he came to see me. When he entered I supposed it was to bring the fatal packet of letters and receive the five thousand dollars. But alas, my dear niece, he now took a new position altogether; hitherto he had seemed to me to be governed by an avaricious desire to make as much money out of my fears as he could by his bargain; for he confessed he had bought the letters of a person to speculate upon; but now his attitude and terms changed.” “Did he demand more, sir?” “More? He demanded what could not be compared with money; he demanded what I had not the power to grant; and in case of my refusal he said that he would at once communicate the papers to the Government.” “To the Government!” repeated Caroline Kent, with surprise and alarm agitating her fine face. “Yes. Once in the hands of the President, my condemnation,— my death would be inevitable.” “What did he ask?” she cried, clasping her hands together in agony. “That which is beyond price, and without which he will accept nothing.” “Name it, sir?” “Your hand.” “My hand!” she gasped, with horror in her looks. “Yes. It is said at last, Caroline. He demands your hand in marriage. Without it he swears,—and he is a man who will keep his oath,—that the Government shall be informed of my treason.” “This is fearful! What can he mean? My hand in marriage! No, no! he could not have placed your honor and happiness,—your life too,—on that condition.” “It was his only condition. He said that if I would give my consent, and say to you that I had done so, he would be satisfied; he would make me no further responsible for the manner you might receive him, but at once surrender me the papers.” “And you gave your consent?” “What could I do, Caroline? My consent does not involve yours. You are free to act as you will.” The young lady rose up and paced the room for some time in silence, with a flushed cheek and flashing eye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. THE DECISION. Colonel Harwood, after having made a full revelation of the subject which had brought him to seek the interview with his daughter, remained silently watching her face as she walked quickly up and down the room. He could not tell how she received his words, whether her flashing eyes were for himself, or caused by Satchell's audacity. At length she sat down by him. Her features were stern, and their rigid expression contrasted strangely with their delicate contour. “Sir —,” she said in a tone that startled him, for the voice did not seem to be hers. Other words she tried to articulate, but a shower of tears burst from her eyes, and dropping her face upon her father's hand she wept like a child. He could not witness such powerful emotion unmoved; his chest heaved convulsively, and he seemed overcome; his strong frame was shaken like an aspen leaf in the breeze. “Look up, my child! look up, dear niece,” he said. “Do not break my heart. I recall all that I have said; I will let him do his worst; I will bear my own shame and not involve your happiness. You shall not wreck yourself for me. Come, I will go to him! I will defy him!” “No, no!” she cried' grasping his arm and pressing him back into his chair; “no, it will not do. You must not let this infamy fall upon you; nay, it is life and death, sir. I will do as you command. Send him hither.” “No; you speak as if you were ready to die with the idea of being united to this man.” “I have made up my mind what I will do; send him hither,” she said, scarcely stirring her lips; for her voice seemed to come from her very soul. “You know that it depends on yourself, my dear Caroline. I have done my part. The papers he will place in my possession within this hour. There is no doubt that he will call to see you.” “Send him; I do not fear to meet him,” she said, with a calmness that amazed him. “You do not think of consenting to wed him!” he exclaimed, with surprise. “Will he be content with less, sir, do you hope? Was it not the condition?” “Not exactly the condition. He said that if I gave my consent and told you that I had given him my consent, it was enough; the correspondence should be delivered into my hands. I know not why he made such singular conditions; it surprised me, and I believed he must have seen you, and got some hope from you that made him sanguine of success.” “Hope from me?” “You do not understand my idea, Caroline. I feared from his seeming confidence that he should have no difficulty with you if he got my consent and influence; that he might have in some way possessed a power over you, as he has over me. He is a singular, a dangerous man; and he seems to come at the knowledge of things in a way perfectly unaccountable. I therefore feared he might know that you dared not refuse him, having you in his power.” “Heaven forbid! You make me horrified, sir! He has no power over me. I have never done any thing that could give him power over me. He can have no such mysterious influence as you suspect.” “It is very extraordinary, more and more so. I do not understand him. One thing is very clear, he would not say he would surrender the papers without feeling confident that the condition he named would be feasible. He would not surrender them upon an uncertainty.” “He has not yet given them up?” “No.” “Nor do I think he will till I give him my consent.” “He solemnly promised to do so, so soon as I returned to the office and told him that I had seen and told you that on your marrying him hung my life and honor.” “And will he take your word?” “Yes,” answered Colonel Harwood, coloring quickly. “Do you know that he will?” “I believe when he says a thing he will do it,” he responded, conscious that Satchell still would hold a rein over him, should he deceive him, in the secret he possessed of his daughter's illegitimate birth. “It may be so. My dear uncle, what you expect of me is a sacrifice that is greater than that of my life. But how can I refuse to save you even at the sacrifice of myself? To you I owe all my nurture, my education, my enjoyments and privileges; to you I owe all but life, and had you been my father you could not have been more kind to me. I feel called upon to surrender all I am to save you, for what I am I owe to you. But perhaps this dreadful sacrifice need not take place. I wish to see this man; I do not fear him. There is nothing in an evil man for the innocent to fear. Say not a word. Your danger is imminent; I will save you.” “Kind, good, noble creature! I seem to be a demon in your presence. I cannot consent; I will go to his office; I shall find him alone; I will seize him by the throat; I will tear the papers from his heart, if he should have hid them there; I will take his life! It is better he should die than you be sacrificed to a man you can never love,—nay, must despise and scorn, and to bear whose name would be infamy.” “Hist, my dear uncle; be calm, I beseech you; do not act rashly; do not add to treason murder. Nothing can save you but my sacrifice, or, what I trust most to, my influence with that fearful man. I pray you, compose yourself. I do not condemn you for coming to me at this crisis. It is not your fault that he made me the instrument of the condition he named; your error, alas! is of older date; it lay in your treason at the outset. Thus, you see, my dear uncle, how wrong done at some former period mars, like a crack in a vase, the whole symmetry of life.” “I feel it, my dear Caroline—I feel the truth of it in my inmost heart.” “Leave the matter now with me. When shall I see this man?” “To-day; but I will let you know in half an hour. Will you see him here and alone?” “Yes. I do not fear him.” “Poor, dear, noble child of my heart! How can I, knowing this evil man, expose you to his presence!” “There is no alternative, my dear uncle,” she said, with sad firmness, rising up. “Do not lengthen the time. The sooner I see him the sooner your mind and my own will be relieved; for I have the deepest curiosity, if I may call the feeling I experience by so light a term, to know on what he has based his confidence respecting me.” “I will send you word as soon as I see him when he will come.” “And also whether you have received those fatal papers from him; but I fear that you will find, sir, that this event will depend upon the issue of his interview with me.” “Were this Mr. Satchell a few years younger, and were he not the notoriously infamous character that he is, it would not be so great a sacrifice to a young girl to wed him, as he is a man of superior talents, and has property.” “That is, if he were any other person than Mr. Satchell, he wouldn't be Mr. Satchell, uncle.” “You have explained my words very sensibly. As he is, for he is near fifty, rude in his manners and coarse in his person, you could only look upon him with repulsion, though he bore an honest name among men. But were he an Adonis in person, I do not suppose, my sweet girl, that you would love him, if you still recollect Edward Manning.” “Recollect Edward Manning, sir!” she repeated, deeply confused, and looking as if suddenly grief-stricken by his words. “O, how can the heart forget! No, sir, I can never forget him; I can never cease to love him, though wedded to another. To me he is still the same. I shall cease to love him when my heart ceases to beat; I shall forget him when memory and the spirit and the soul die.” “I am sorry for you, Caroline. I have felt deeply your disappointment since by accident I discovered that he was the object of your attachment.” “Attachment! it is a cold word, sir; passion!” she cried, with animation almost wildly eloquent, “deep, heart-burning passion, is the word to express what I felt—nay, what I feel! He is married, —more's the pity!” she said, touchingly. “If there is a woman I love because she loves him, yet hate because he loves her, it is his beautiful wife. Oh, dear uncle, in alluding to him you have struck a chord that for weeks I have dared not stir, even in the loneliness of my chamber, lest its broken notes should drive me wild. I have tried hard to keep my heart down and teach it to submit. Go, sir! I must be alone; I have need to compose my spirits.” “Forgive me, Caroline?” “Yes, I forgive. Do not stay; leave me to myself, dear uncle,” she cried passionately. He hesitated whether it were safe to do so, she seemed so strangely excited. But she waved her hand nervously and rapidly for him to depart. He closed the door, and descended the stairs with a slow step and a heavy heart, listening as he went, expecting each moment to hear a shriek of anguish from the room. “Poor girl! as if I had not torn her heart enough,” he said sadly, “but I must allude to her unfortunate attachment to Edward Manning, and open again the fountains of her grief. But she will soon be calm, she has such wonderful self-possession. I will now hasten on my errand. Is it possible that I am at last so near the possession of those long wished for papers, that hang, like the sword of Diogenes, above my head!” he exclaimed, as he hurried to the street-gate, his bosom glowing with that selfish joy which irresistibly at such a time would be experienced by the most disinterested. For a few moments, in the contemplation of his own happy success, he forgot the sacrifice at which he was about to obtain it. Such is human nature. The noblest emotions of gratitude ultimately resolve themselves into a man's own proprium, and lose their individuality in his. But ere Colonel Harwood reached the alley in which Satchell's office stood, his thoughts were again upon his daughter; and more than once his step faltered, and he half-turned, as if resolved not to put her to the trial. But when he reflected how all else depended upon it and that it must be done, he moved onward again. As he came into the alley the clock of the Old South struck twelve. “It is just the hour I appointed to meet him,” he exclaimed, hastening up the alley, his heart throbbing with mingled hope and fear, as the probability of getting or not getting his papers rose and fell in his agitated mind. As he came to the door, in his absence of mind he stepped into a pool of soft mud and water which was directly under the window of Handy, the boot black's room. Whether Handy kept that particular puddle of water there for the purpose of muddying the boots of gentlemen who were passing, (as the alley was a great thoroughfare,) and thus get custom, is a question that we will not answer, as we do not wish to record any thing against Handy, that would lessen the consideration the discriminating reader may have already entertained for him. The fact is, however, that every day, during the dryest weather particularly, this little dirty puddle was there; and upon an average seven gentlemen per diem irretrievably soiled their boots therein, and Handy being at home, after the example of surgeons who are ever ready at hand when side-walks are slippery, got the polishing of them. This little pond was a source of great revenue to Handy, much more so indeed than the Frog Pond ever promises to be to the Corporation. “Massa, you hab muddy you boot,” cried Handy, to Colonel Harwood; and springing forward with his brush in his hand, the sable African caught the Colonel by the ancle and held him fast, while he began to rub his boot with the most praise worthy zeal. The Colonel, however was in no mood at such a time to be detained; so unceremoniously overthrowing the astonished Handy with a thrust of his foot, he hastened into the entry and up the tottering stair-way to Satchell's office. “That am a berry independum gemman, Kaleb,” said Handy, picking himself up and then gathering his brushes from the ground. “He 'pear berry much in a hurry.” “You lose you sixpence dat time, neighbor Handy,,' said Kaleb the cobler, who sat with his door open upon his bench hammering out a piece of sole leather upon his lap-stone. “If I was the gentlemen that step in your puddle there, I would give you a rap over the head.” “You ain't no gen'leman, Master Kaleb Kemp, and derefore you don't do 'em,” answered Handy, with ineffable dignity. “If I was the town I would make you pay taxes on your duckpond,” continued Kaleb, good naturedly. “Don't you say nothin', Mas' Kaleb. Don't I bring you custom? How many boot you tink I rip when I clean 'em, and recommen' gen'lemen to paternise you.” “It is very true, Handy,” responded the little cobbler, laughing, and giving a rap, a-tap, rap upon his sole-leather. “How is your Rosy since you saw her last, Handy?” “She berry well, Mr. Kemp. How am you' lady?” interrogated Handy, in his turn. And the two gentlemen then proceeded to converse upon the respective merits of calf-skin and morrocco for boots.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. THE SURRENDER OF THE PAPERS. Satchell was in his dingy office seated at his table in the armchair, when a rap at his door caused him to lay down several papers which he was examining, and look at his watch. “It is two minutes past twelve,” he mumbled. “It must be Harwood.” He rose and proceeded to the door of his office-and let in Colonel Harwood, saying, in a bland manner,— “Glad to see you, my dear sir. From your looks you have succeeded with your daughter.” “My niece, Mr. Satchell!” cried Colonel Harwood, with alarm. “Do not forget yourself again.” “I did forget. Be seated, sir,” he added, as he re-locked his door. “Colonel Harwood bowed and remained standing; for his former experience had told him that Satchell's chairs were not to be trusted. “I have seen my niece, sir,” observed the Colonel, his voice agitated in spite of his effort to control its tremulous cadences. “And what said she? Did you make known to her that your life and honor were in her hands?” demanded Satchell, with a keen observing glance from his brow-shadowed eyes. “Yes, sir, I made known to her so much of the facts as was necessary, and as I had promised you I would do.” “And she said what?” “That she was ready to sacrifice herself, if needful for me.” “Sacrifice? Was that her word?” “To speak frankly with you, it was.” “Very well; I like her no less. No doubt she will look upon it as a sacrifice to marry an elderly, middle-aged gentleman like myself. I am very glad she thinks it will be a sacrifice.” “You are?” “Yes, sir, I am pleased with her remark; but I am surprised at her readiness.” “If you had been present, sir, at our trying interview you would not have termed it readiness. I thought at one moment she would have spurned me with scorn and indignation.” “Yes, she is a spirited girl; that is clear from her eyes. So she was reluctant at first?” “No person could have been more so.” “But she finally yielded?” “That I cannot, will not say. I performed faithfully my part. I have now come, sir, to see if you are ready to perform yours.” “One question more. Do you think she will consent to marry me?” “I do not know, sir; she would only do it in the last extremity.” “That is what I expected. Yet you still think that she might be driven to consent to be Mrs. Satchell? Speak plainly, Colonel.” “I believe she would prefer death to such a marriage,” answered Colonel Harwood, firmly and plainly. “I would rather die than compel her to it. But I am not alone; there is my wife and children, who will fall with me if I am arraigned and executed as a traitor. Were I a bachelor—alone in the world, sir, I would not take these steps to keep you from doing your worst with those documents. But if I can save my family—my spirited boy—from disgrace by this marriage, and she is ready—nay, insists, now that she knows all, that she shall be made the victim, not me, I can only let it take its course. It is humiliating; but it is the decree of fate.” “Her repugnance to me you think was very positive?” “I do. But you seem to be pleased at this.” “I am; I shall, you see, have the greater satisfaction in overcoming it.” “You are a very extraordinary person. You seem to rejoice in what threatens to ensure your defeat.” “No, I shall not be defeated. The more repugnance she has to me the better.” “Have you any secret power over my daughter, sir, as you have over me?” asked Colonel Harwood, with amazement and alarm. “No, sir,” responded Satchell, smiling, with a sinister movement of the muscles of his lip. “Where is your daughter—your niece, I would say?” “At Madame Delano's.” “Did you tell her I would wait upon her?” “Yes.” “And what said she to that?” “That she would see you.” “How did she appear when she said this?” “Pale, sir, but firm.” “Did she say that she should accept my proposals to her?” “She said, sir, that she was prepared to take any step to save me.” “Even to the dreaded one of marrying me?” added Satchell, sarcastically. “Yes,” answered the Colonel, agitated with indignant grief at the painful situation into which his conduct had placed his child. He looked upon Satchell with the deepest hatred, while he feared him, as having in his hands the power over his life and honor, and the happiness of his family. He felt that he could spring upon him there as he stood before him, and not only wrest the papers from his hand, which held them in its grasp, but take his life and rid society of a monster. But Satchell was a man of a more powerful frame and younger than himself, and the issue he feared might go against him, when he felt that his fate would be sealed; that, after such an unsuccessful attempt to gain possession of the papers, no power on earth would induce him to withhold them from the Government at Washington. He therefore said as calmly as he could, “I hope, sir, that you will now surrender to me those letters and plans, as you promised.” “I promised that you should have them, and you shall. There, sir,” he added, extending to him the package of papers, “you will find them all there, I believe.” Colonel Harwood almost bounded towards him in his eagerness to get the fatal papers in his hands. He grasped them with a strange cry of mixed joy and triumph, and with trembling fingers examined them one by one by the light of the candle, his whole frame shaking so with emotion that the floor vibrated, as it often did when a heavily loaded dray thundered past in the adjacent street. Satchell stood by looking at him with a look of seeming indifference, though a slight smile moved across his face at witnessing the extraordinary agitation of his late victim. “You find them all right, sir, I believe,” he said quietly, after the last document had been opened and glanced at. “Yes, yes, all are here. Mr. Satchell, this moment is the happiest of my life! If ever I felt grateful to Almighty God it is at this moment. I hold in my hand the cause of more wretchedness to me than ever lay at a man's heart. These papers that I now grasp have caused me days of misery and wakeful nights of horror. Thank God, I have them now! and I can even thank you. I feel as if I could embrace you for delivering them into my possession. There is my hand, sir. I forgive and forget all that is past.” “I never shake any man by the hand, Colonel,” answered Satchell. “Very well, let it pass. I am so overjoyed that I could not only take by the hand but hug to my heart every beggar I meet in the street. Can I realize that I hold these fatal letters in my hand? Oh, joy! joy!” “You seem to forget at what price you have got them back, sir,” observed Satchell, with deliberate and malicious desire to darken his felicity. A cloud instantly passed across his face. He sighed heavily, and ejaculated with anguish,— “Poor Caroline! My dear victimized child!” “One would think I were a very respectable devil, Colonel, the way you regard a woman's marriage with me.” “When I know WHAT you are, sir, is there any surprise that I should feel as I do? But the sacrifice is made! But these papers shall never more rise in judgment against me!” as he spoke he approached the fire, and deliberately placed upon the blaze the letters, one after another, and watched with intense attention each as it consumed to ashes. When he had in this manner destroyed the last vestige of his treason he rose up, and turned upon Satchell a countenance that fairly shone with serene happiness. He seemed to be another man altogether. Joy, peace, composure all at once had returned to his features, from which they had so long been exiled. Satchell marked with surprise the change. “You seem to be a happy man, Colonel Harwood.” “I am, sir. There is but one cloud that casts its shadow over my peace. It is the reflection of my poor child's fate.” “Do not tremble for her.” “I do not mean to, sir. I still feel that I am her father, and I shall watch over her with a father's eye.” “You need not fear for your daughter, Colonel Harwood. I swear to you, she shall not marry me without her free consent.” “You do?” “Yes.” “Then you have surrendered to me those papers!” cried the Colonel, as he looked with an air of satisfaction at the heap of white ashes where he had consumed them. “You have put out of your hands those papers without recompense; for she will never consent to become your wife.” “Very well. I can but try,” he answered carelessly. “Mr. Satchell, from your confident manner, I feel confident you possess some secret power over her—some hold upon her fears.” “No, sir; I have never spoken to her. The first time I ever knew you had such a child, or that she was in existence, was some three months ago, in the second interview which I had with you.” “And in what way then?” “From your own lips. When I demanded a high price for the letters, you said that you could not pay it, unless your niece was so fortunate as to marry a rich young man to whom she was tenderly attached. Upon my questioning you closely, you told me that it was Mr. Edward Manning, the son of Judge Manning. You added that you hoped the marriage would take place, in which case you knew that your niece would place the money at your disposal. This was my first knowledge of your child, whom you then called, not your daughter, but your niece. Upon my asking you what hope there was of the union, for I wanted to know what probability there was of my getting the sum I at first demanded, your account led me to see at once that there was no hope for it; for he already was betrothed to another, (whom he has married a few weeks since,) and that the passion was a romantic one wholly on her side. No, sir, I hold no secret talisman over your child. I depend only upon natural circumstances for a successful interview with her. Please inform her that I will call upon her at seven this evening.” “Not before?” “No; I have engagements all the afternoon. You seem to be in haste,” he said, with a keen glance. “Yes, I am desirous and so is she of having the interview over.” “In good time. Now that you have got the possession of the mischievous papers, the matter rests with me and her.” “How you could give me those documents so freely on an uncertainty, after having refused five thousand dollars, I cannot understand, sir.” “Perhaps you will, one of these days.” “Will you tell me, before I leave, how those papers came into your possession?” “Willingly. I was called upon to give advice to a couple of criminals in jail. They had been guilty of robbery and murder. One of them had been a soldier in the war, and in your garrison. For some offence you had him severely whipped at the drum-head. He deserted, and fled to the British camp. He became a servant of General Leslie's, and in his services as valet became a ware of the correspondence, by finding the letters in the General's pocket. One day he took his opportunity to secrete them, resolved to escape and in revenge lay them before the United States Government. This was the very day General Leslie was killed; and as he fled about the moment of that event, he was supposed to have been the murderer. Fearing, therefore, that he would be arrested for it, he changed his name and made his way to a sea-port. He had not money to reach Washington, and so he shipped for a voyage to get funds. He was shipwrecked and met with various adventures, but always kept these papers, they being in a belt about his body; for revenge always takes good care of the instruments by which it is to be achieved. At length, several years after the war, he found his way here again, and committed a robbery and murder. Finding I could not do any thing with his case, and that he would without doubt be convicted, I told him so, and advised him to make up his mind to die. He then told me he had these papers and their history, and asked me if I would see that the Government had them. He offered them to me for twenty dollars; I paid it to him, for I saw at a glance their value. The man was in a month afterwards executed; the papers are there in their ashes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. THE UNCLE AND NIECE. When Satchell had concluded his account of the mode in which the papers had come into his possession, Colonel Harwood, who had listened with deep attention, said,— “I remember distinctly the man and for what I had him so severely flogged; I also recollect his desertion. How extraordinary that he should have been so mysteriously the instrument of my subsequent sufferings and my present anxiety; for now that I am relieved respecting myself, through the destruction of this treasonable correspondence, I begin to feel fearfully for my dear child. Would to God, Mr. Satchell, you would forego this thing. Be a generous man, sir. Have pity upon her. Would you wed one who loathes you?” “You need not make any appeal to me, Colonel Harwood. The price has been paid you. Your daughter is mine.” “But only of her free will.” “I repeat only of her free will.” “Then she is safe. But suppose she refuses you, what equivalent have you for the loss of the five thousand dollars which you might have obtained for those papers?” 6 “I have no fears of losing, sir. Good morning, Colonel. I have an engagement abroad at this hour.” “Good morning, sir,” answered Colonel Harwood, with difficulty repressing his anger at this cavalier mode of terminating the interview. “Remember, Mr. Satchell,” he said, as he went out, “that I no longer stand in fear of you; you are no longer my tyrant; and I give you fair warning that I shall protect my child against any force or machinations which you may attempt to bring to your aid.” “Do not fear, sir. But I would inform you, Colonel Harwood, that you forget that I still have power over you. You know that I hold a secret almost as dear to you as that I have but now resigned.” “True, true!” cried the poor man. “When shall I be free from your clutches and evil power?” he groaned out. “When I have accomplished my revenge.” “Revenge! Against me?” “No.” “Against my daughter?” “No, sir.” “Then whom?” “It is not discreet to tell one's secret,” answered Satchell, “but it is a man I do not love,” he added, with the deepest intonation of hatred. “But what connection can this person who has incurred your hatred have with me or my daughter, that you couple our names?” “Did I couple your names?” “You said your evil power over me would only terminate when your vengeance terminates; yet you say your vengeance is not against me nor my daughter.” “You repeat only that which is the truth.” “Yet, one would think,—I must think, sir, that you hate my child, in that you are willing to render her miserable. Could you not have devised any other condition for the surrender of the papers?” “It is too late now to complain, sir,” answered Satchell, closing the door and locking it after him. Colonel Harwood finding himself in the narrow entry went down stairs and out of the house, Satchell following him. As they went out of the alley-door, Satchell said,— “You will notify your niece, sir, that I will see her at seven this evening.” With these parting words he turned down the alley. Colonel Harwood walked slowly up the alley in the opposite direction. He had now achieved the great object of his desires; he had got possession of papers which would have hanged him; he had burned them, one by one, and seen them consume to ashes. A heavy load that nearly sunk him into the grave was all at once lifted from his heart. He had received a reprieve like a criminal condemned to die, and pardoned at the moment of execution. Yet, now, that the first emotion of joy was passed, he seemed, when he thought upon poor Caroline, to have purchased his reprieve at a price far higher than it was worth; for, always, things ardently longed for, when possessed seem valueless. He took his way towards the boarding-school, thinking it better to see his daughter in person than write her a note. He found her alone in her room; her face was very pale, but she met him with a smile. He thought that her manner was constrained: it might have been so; for when one has loved what was believed to be good, when it finds it has loved what is false, it may still strive to yield as before the homage of the heart; but the heart will slowly obey. Caroline could not forget the kindness she had for years received from him, how he had watched over her, educated her, supported her, and out of his narrow income giving her the highest advantages of mental and personal cultivation. She loved him for all this; she could never forget his kindness. But she had been greatly, painfully disappointed to learn that her uncle was a traitor. She might still love him indeed, but she felt she could never respect him. She could no longer see in him the brave soldier, as she gazed upon his gray hair, and fine, military countenance, and martial figure, but the traitor! “Still, still he was her uncle,” she would exclaim, as she sat by her window after he left her, sadly reflecting upon the scene she had passed through with him. She was a proud, sensitive, high-minded girl, and she felt keenly her uncle's degradation; for in her mind he was degraded; to her idolized love he had fallen. She could never look upon him in the same light she had done. Perhaps she thought more heavily of his treason than of her own painful situation with reference to Satchell. “Have you seen him, sir?” she asked, as Colonel Harwood entered and seated himself. “I have, Caroline.” “And those dreadful papers?” “He gave them into my hands.” “All—all of them?” “Yes. I am free! I burned them up one by one before I quitted his office; I saw them in their ashes.” “And you have nothing more to fear then from that unhappy affair?” she continued, in the same rapid tone of interrogation. “Nothing, my dear girl.” “Then my heart is light again!” she cried, with joyful smiles; “now that this fearful danger no longer hangs over you, I am happy. Your life, your honor, your family are saved.” “But you forget the price, my dear Caroline,” he said sadly, and taking her hand. “No, I do not,” she answered with emotion, but firmly. “What said this man? Did he freely give the papers?” “Yes.” “Only upon your assertion that you had seen me?” “Yes, strange as it is, he surrendered them at once.” “And yet was not certain that I would consent to be made the price; it is extraordinary!” “To me unexplicable. He is one of the most singular men I ever knew; his conduct seems inconsistent, but I know that he is not a man who will do things unadvisedly. He has some deep motive; in a word, he knows that you will consent to be his wife.” “How can he know it, sir?” she exclaimed, with flashing eyes. “I do not say he knows it.” “No, no; he cannot know what is not nor cannot be.” “Has he not ever seen you except at the time you saw him at the gate?” “Not to my knowledge.” “Can he have any power over you from any act of your life unknown to me?” “No sir,” she answered, deeply coloring at the inquiry; but it was the rich hue of angry surprise at a question that involved the inference of her having done some wrong in her life; “no, sir,” she repeated, firmly. “I am then wholly at a loss.” “When am I to see this extraordinary man, uncle?” she asked, with composure. “He says he will call here at seven o'clock this evening. Till then he has engagements.” “I will see him; I do not fear him; it is in my power to act freely and independently, now you are no longer in his hands, dear uncle.” “Then you will refuse to wed him?” “I do, most positively.” “Thank Heaven! But I tremble for the consequences.” “I am indifferent to them. He cannot force me to consent. I wish to see him; I have firmness and character enough to carry me through with the interview. Were your life and honor to depend upon its issue, I should feel differently and tremble. But now that he has surrendered the papers to you on his own expressed conditions, I am at liberty to do as I please.” “You are. I breathe more freely again,” said the Colonel, with animation. “I think that, shrewd as he is, he has this time overreached himself. I will now bid you good morning. I left home in such agitation and have been out so long, that they will be alarmed if I am not there at dinner. Try and keep your mind composed. I see that you nor I are in his power now. I will speak to Madame Delano as I go down, and tell her that a gentleman will call and see you on business this evening. I have the greatest confidence in your discretion and judgment; your mind is equal to his, and I dare say he will find that though you are young, you are not a weak young girl to be intimidated into a hateful union. Doubtless he hopes to work upon your fears, and in this places his chief confidence of success; this must be his dependence. He regards you as a young, timid school-girl, who will yield from alarm, whom he can brow-beat. It is likely, when he saw you, that he took a fancy to your face; for the idea that he has fallen in love, is absurd.” “Do not speak of it, sir. I shall not become his wife, he may be assured.” “Do you know that he is aware of your attachment to Edward Manning?” “How should he know it?” she asked, with deep blushes and a sparkling eye. “I told him of it.” “In hopes to divert him from his purpose?” “It was mentioned in our conversations,” answered Colonel Harwood, who thought it best not to inform her of the particulars, lest she should in truth heartily despise him; for he knew she would look with haughty repugnance upon the very idea of his pre-planning advantages from her possible union with Manning. “What did he say?” “He made no remark. But the hour of dinner is already at hand. He will be here at seven. I shall be most anxious to learn the issue of his interview; if I will send up my man Henry, will you despatch a line or two to me stating the result?” “I will, sir. Be assured that it will be favorable. Mr. Satchell will retire from the contest with confusion; for now that he has no power over you, he can hold none over me.” Colonel Harwood left the house, and as he walked along towards his own abode, the last words she had spoken still echoed in his ear:— “Now that he has no power over you, he can hold none over me.” They seemed to be repeated by a hundred inward voices. They made a painful and still deeper impression upon him. He could not help repeating the words aloud. “Yes, if it were true; if the words were true,” he added, after saying them over for the fifth time. “He still has power over me, though she knows it not. Alas, she is the object and instrument of that power! he has a fearful power still. I would rather die than have that sweet, proud girl know that she is my natural daughter; it would either drive her to madness or to the most reckless abandonment of life and character. Caroline, in such case, could know no half-way. Only by unfolding to her the secret of her birth, could he have any influence with her. Dare he contemplate this? if I thought so, he should not live an hour. But he solemnly promised secresy. He fulfilled his promise about the papers, and promptly surrendered them. Doubtless he will do so now. If possible I fear more anxiety about this than about the discovery of my treason. No, he will not tell her; if I believed he would—if I suspected he would—I would either slay him, or remove her beyond his power. But I will trust him. He can have no motive in betraying the secret; it would rather defeat than secure his object.” In this manner reflecting upon the coming interview between his daughter and Satchell, he reached home, and entered his dwelling with a heart quite as heavy and a countenance as sad as when he left it, though from a different cause. Sorrow and anxiety always fill the heart, from whatever source they spring. We think any other grief preferable to the existing one; but each woe, as the ball the cup, fits and fills up the whole heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. THE SEALS OF THE PAPERS. The clock in the Park street tower was just tolling seven o'clock, on the evening of the day in which the events related in the preceding chapter transpired, when Simmins Satchell entered the gate that led to Madame Delano's. It was a bright moonlight night, and upon the lawn within the street enclosure were walking or sporting several of the young girls of the boarding school. Satchell in his snuff-colored clothes and stout stick, his eyes shaded by his broad-brimmed, greasy hat, took his way towards the portico without noticing them. His heart had no sympathy with innocence and beauty; their musical laughter he had no ear for, nor an eye for their sweet faces, softened in the beams of the moonlight to still greater loveliness. As he passed near them and they saw who he was, for he was known to them all, as any marked, bad man in a town is known to all the young folks, they shrunk back and let him pass. There was no pleasant greeting such as welcomed Colonel Harwood, no grouping about him for a pleasant word; they avoided him and stood off aloof, and silently gazed at him as he advanced to the door. They then whispered to each other with looks of fear, and did not resume their sports until he had been admitted into the hall by the servant. “I wish to see Miss Kent,” he said, addressing Madame Delano, who came out of the drawing-room. “Yes, oh, yes, Colonel Harwood said a gentleman would be here,” answered the lady, to whom Satchell's person was strange. “Show the gentleman to Miss Kent's parlor,” she added, to the gray-headed footman in attendance. Satchell followed the old man up the carpeted stairs, and was conducted by him to the door of Caroline Kent's room, not the private boudoir in which her father had had his interviews with her, but a small parlor adjoining, and communicating with it. The room though not so elegant as the one she commonly occupied as a sleeping-room and where she had received Colonel Harwood, was still neatly furnished. Upon a centre table stood a small astral lamp, and a few books strewn upon it with a writing desk, showed the literary taste of the occupier. The quick ear of the young girl had caught the sound of a strange foot-step in the hall, and she knew that it was the lawyer who had demanded the interview that was now approaching. She was in her boudoir when his foot-fall was heard upon the stairs ascending. Her heart throbbed almost audibly with every tread that fell upon her ear. She approached her glass, not from vanity, beautiful as she was, (for she did not wish to adorn herself for sacrifice,) but to see if her face was calm. In her hand she held a book, and entering the little parlor she seated herself by the table and commenced reading, or rather the appearance of reading. This, however, was only to give him the idea of her composure as he came in. Her cheek was pale; her lips compressed; her eyes dark and fixed. She looked like one who was expecting the entrance of the messenger to announce to her that her death-hour had come. The footman knocked upon the door. In spite of herself she started, and the color deepened upon her cheeks; but she composed herself, and responded in a firm voice,— “Come in.” “A gentleman to see you, Miss Kent,” said the old servitor, bowing, and ushering Satchell in. “Very well, Andrew; you may go,” she answered in an even tone, and with a manner perfectly self-possessed. Andrew closed the door. Satchell remained standing. She cast her eyes towards him, and said politely,— “Mr. Satchell, I believe, sir?” “Yes, at your service, miss,” he said, fairly embarrassed by her self-possession. “Be seated, sir.” Satchell took a seat upon the sofa. Caroline re-seated herself by the centre-table opposite to him, facing him. There was a space of about five feet between their positions. Satchell held his hat between his knees, rolling up the brim with an awkward hesitation extraordinary in a man of his consummate audacity. Caroline Kent held the book open between her fingers and thumb, and quietly resting upon the table, looked firmly in his dark, sinister countenance. He saw that she waited for him to speak, and he now prepared himself to enter upon the business which brought him there. “Miss Kent, you are probably aware of the object of my visit,” he said, all at once assuming his confidence and decision; and he planted his deep, dark orbs upon her face with a gleam that she shrunk from meeting. “I am not, sir.” “Not? Have you not seen Colonel Harwood? has he not been here? has the man deceived me?” “He has been here, sir; he told me that I might expect a visit from you at this hour; he even told me that your object in coming was to do me the honor to propose for my hand. But as I have no doubt he was in a jesting humor, I am at liberty to suppose that you have come to see me on some other subject. One to look at you, sir, would hardly be likely to associate so joyful a thing as a marriage with the sight of you.” “Indeed!” he exclaimed with surprise. “You are very much disposed to be witty.” “No, sir, I have never had the reputation of a wit; if I happen to be so now it is wholly to be referred to the inspiration of your agreeable presence.” “Ho, hoh! You are inclined to be merry at my expense.” “Pardon me, sir; I have always been taught from my youth up, to reverence old age.” “This is extremely pleasant. You are fond of amusement; you are disposed to laugh.” “I assure you, sir, I was never more disposed to be serious in my life. They say one must never laugh when they see the devil or a death's head!” “I do not know how to take you,” he cried, vexed and amazed at such a reception, when he expected to find a young, trembling girl, ready to fall at his feet and implore his mercy. As he gazed on her he thought he had never seen a person so beautiful and spirited in eye and air. He found that her wit and intellect were equal with his own; and that he must pursue an entirely different course of tactics from those he had meditated. “You had best not think of taking me at all,” she answered to his last remark. “This trifling, my pretty Miss,” he said, sternly frowning upon her, “will not answer. You are in my power.” “I?” she repeated, with flashing eye. “Yes, you.” “No, no, sir; I am not in your power. You cannot intimidate me; I do not fear you. I know well your object in coming hither. I know at what price you have surrendered the secret papers on which were suspended my uncle's life and honor. But, sir, I am no party to that contract; if you have yielded the papers, you have lost them without an equivalent, as is just. My uncle faithfully performed his part of the contract; he came to me; he told me his whole story; he described to me the unrelenting character of the man who held over him such fearful power, with which accident had invested him. Before he mentioned your name, I hated you. When he said that it was the noted Simmins Satchell, I only wondered that I had not guessed the name, so true was the likeness to the most evil man in Boston. Sir, listen to me; hear all I have to say. My uncle told me the condition, and felt that it was his duty to urge me to accept your proposal of marriage. Sir, he did his part honorably; he went to you and told you so. Strange as it is, you gave him up, on his mere word, which he might have falsified for so great a stake, the papers on which all dear to him depended. The matter, therefore, now that my uncle has nothing to fear, rests with you and me.” “That is true,” answered Satchell, looking at her with the same steady, stern, brow-beating look. “Now what does Madamoiselle say?” “That between you and me there remains nothing but that this interview be at once terminated.” She spoke with dignity and an air of command, mingled with a look of proud contempt. “Then I am to understand that you refuse to endorse the conditions on which I was to surrender the papers.” “There was no condition that has not been complied with, sir.” “Do you suppose that I gave your uncle the papers merely on the remote prospect that his niece would become my wife?” “Pray, sir, on what ground did you have the presumption to suppose that I would ever degrade myself in this manner?” “There was an implied condition. Colonel Harwood was and is bound to see it carried out; and you are bound to comply.” “No, sir; I deny that you have any further power over him or me. The papers which you have so long basely held over his head to extort money from him, are no longer in existence; they were the wand of your evil power; and, necromancer, your power is crushed! I marvel greatly, sir, that one so shrewd and experienced in years as you are, should have suffered yourself to be thus defeated in your objects. Sir, our interview is at an end. I desired to see you, that you might from my own mouth hear my opinion of you, and know that you are beneath my contempt. Marry you? I would rather be torn in pieces on the rack!” “You seem to have a very just appreciation of my merits,” answered Satchell, sarcastically. “I am very much obliged to you, for this free and candid expression of your opinion of me—very! But perhaps I shall be able to change it, perhaps—I do not say positively; for there is nothing positive in this world; but possibly, I say, I may be able to make you sing out of the other side of your mouth, pretty bird.” While he was uttering these words in a tone of peculiar secret triumph, he was drawing from his deep pocket a small file of papers. He took them in his hand, and laying his finger on the inscription, said quietly and with a malicious leer, that made her heart stop beating with suspense,— “I hope, lady, that you will give me credit for more judgment and discretion than you have just done. I knew better than to trust Colonel Harwood too far; I had too much world's wisdom to surrender on a mere probability of getting your consent, such important papers as I held. Oh, no! You must yet give me credit for experience quite equal to my age. The package of papers which I placed in Colonel Harwood's hands, and which he was too happy to get to examine very closely, (though they would have stood his severest and most deliberate scrutiny,) was nothing more than an ingenious and skilful imitation of pen, ink and paper, fold, blot and soil-marks of the original documents. Those I now hold in my hand. No, no; I must yet have credit for sagacity from even your sweet lips. I see by your looks that I have already arisen again in your estimation. But, badinage aside, Miss Kent, here are the veritable letters,” and he struck the two fore-fingers of his right hand upon the package which lay in the palm of his left, “these are the veritable letters on which hang your uncle's life and honor, and the reputation and happiness of his wife and children; nay, your own; for the shadow of his disgrace will reach even you.” Caroline Kent started from her chair as he first announced to her this terrible fact; and as he continued to speak on, she gazed upon him with horror; and at the same time the most painful alarm for her poor uncle filled her bosom, flushing her cheek and dimming her eyes. Suddenly, as he ceased speaking, she made a spring for the file of papers; she caught them in her grasp, and bounded for the door. In an instant she was in his grasp, and the documents forcibly wrested from her small, firm-clenching fingers. She stood where he stopped her, pale, panting, with flashing eyes and heaving bosom. He turned the key in the door, and cast it to the back of the room into a corner. “You are disappointed, Miss Kent,” he said, re-arranging the papers which had been loosened in the struggle. He spoke calmly and with a quiet smile, as if nothing had occurred. “Come, be seated, and let us talk this matter over.” “I am indeed disappointed,” she answered, with deep emotion. “But, sir, I do not believe your story; if you would impose upon my uncle, you would impose upon me. I do not believe these are the genuine, but that you gave him the true papers.” “Do you remember that your uncle had a peculiar seal some years ago?” “I do.” “Perhaps you have notes or letters in your possession sealed with it: it was a cross, with a sword above it, a dove perched upon the sword.” “I remember it. He lost it in the war.” “True, so I have ascertained. He uses another and different one now. Would you recognize the old stamp?” “Yes,” she answered, as if very reluctantly replying to any thing he said. “There it is,” he answered, showing her the seals upon several of the letters. “These are proofs that the letters are the true ones. Upon those I gave your uncle there were no seals, for I could not counterfeit the seal so well. They appeared torn off, and he supposed they were torn off. Here are the original papers, with the seals as he sealed them.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. THE ALTERNATIVE. Caroline Kent felt perfectly convinced that the words of the lawyer were true. All her self-possession seemed ready to desert her. She felt that she was indeed in his power, now that her uncle was again. For him she felt the deepest sorrow and alarm. She pictured his joy and happy relief after burning the papers, and remembered how light-hearted he felt now that he was free. Yet it was all a deception! He was still in the same danger, though ignorant of it; the papers were still in Satchell's hands; at any moment the storm might burst and overwhelm him with infamy. Such were her painful reflections as she stood there before Satchell, who steadily watched her countenance with an expression on his face of quiet exultation. He seemed to divine her thoughts. “Miss Kent,” he said, “you have you perceive censured my want of tact without good foundation. I am not a man likely to throw up the cards with the game in my own hand. What I have told you is the truth. Colonel Harwood is as much in my power to-day as he was yesterday. I see you feel for him; you have it in your power to save him. He is now happy; he believes that he is safe. Are you willing to destroy this peace? are you willing that he should be once more made a wretched slave to his fears? are you willing to tell him the dreadful truth, and witness his anguish and despair?” “No, no,” she answered quickly and nervously; “he must never know how he has been deceived,” and she wrung her hands. “Yet he must know it; if you refuse to save him, he shall know it. And more than this, neither money nor any thing else earthly shall get these papers. Tomorrow they shall be on their way to the Government. No power shall save him.” “Oh, most dreadful!” “I am glad you feel his danger and sympathize with his situation; it is in your power to keep the truth from him.” “How?” she cried almost fiercely. “How! By becoming mine. I offer you my hand.” “Demon!” “Very well; demon or angel, it is the same to me. Words are but words, mere circles in the water made by a pebble thrown in. It is true it is a great sacrifice. I am near fifty; I am rather ugly of visage, and ungainly in person; I have not the best reputation in the world, and have been in prison for forgery; indeed I am known among men as the Rogues' Attorney. You see I have attractions for a young and blooming girl, and withal a high-spirited one. I name over my merits, that you may have less repugnance to me.” She gazed upon him with amazement visible in her beautiful but angry face. “Sir,” she said, “you do but jest with me; your words show it. If you wished me to wed you, you would not thus seek to make yourself more hideous than you are. Tell me plainly, what is the price at which these papers are to be purchased, and my poor uncle freed from your power?” “The price of your hand—none less.” “You surely do not seek to render a young girl who has never injured you miserable for life. You cannot desire to make me your wife,” she cried, earnestly. “Say that it is but a jest.” “I never jest, lady. You know the terms at which your uncle's life and honor are to be purchased. These papers, and believe me I speak the truth, are sufficient to hang him; if they are placed by me in the hands of the Government, he will be executed for treason within three months; he knows it as well as I do. There remains but little more to be said. You know the terms; if you regard his life and honor, these papers shall be yours the very moment you consent to become mine.” “Consent?” “At the altar, I mean.” “O God!” she cried, covering her face, “this is fearful.” All at once she threw herself at his feet. She raised her face to his streaming with tears; she supplicated him with clasped hands. “Save, oh! save my uncle, and spare, spare me.” “Only on the condition already named,” he answered, coldly. “Be mine and the papers are yours.” “Marry you?” she repeated with infinite scorn, rising to her feet; “no, never. I will perish first.” “Very well,” said Satchell, taking up his hat. “Tomorrow the fate of your uncle is sealed.” “Stay—stay!” she cried, springing towards him and catching him by the arm; “come, co—com—come back, sir,” she stuttered out, in the most painful state of agitation. “Well, what do you say? You know that to be Satchell's wife you will be honored with the appellation of the Rogues' Bride. You will share my infamy; all my crimes and sins will serve as a lens for people to look at you through. You will be Satchell's wife. What an honor! can't you realize it? Then you will live in such style! I shall perhaps purchase another chair, and another cup and saucer and tea-spoon, for my dingy office in — alley; for there you are to live with me. I keep no servant as I have but one room, and you will be servant-maid, housekeeper and every thing at which you can make yourself useful. You see that I make you great offers.” “I will not consent; I will die first!” she exclaimed, filled with terror at the picture he had drawn. “You forget your uncle's danger.” “He must bear it, then. I cannot save him at a price like this. Sir, rather than be your wife I would take my own life.” “Then the question is settled. His fate also.” “Is there no other condition?” “None. You are in one scale, and his life in the other.” She stood a moment, looking the very statue of irresolute despair. Her eyes wandered upon the papers. He saw their direction, and buttoned them up in his breast-pocket. “I cannot save him,—I cannot; he would not ask it,” she cried, in anguish. “Then good evening, Miss Kent,” he said, stooping for the key and going with it to the door; he placed it in the lock. She stood trembling like a leaf following each movement. He turned towards her; he approached her. “I will give you one moment more to reverse your decision.” “Sir, have you no heart—no humanity. Can you witness my distress unmoved, when you have the power to remove it?” “No, the power you have, not I. You have only to say `Yes,' to save your uncle.” “And sacrifice myself?” “You know what a high crime treason is. Picture to yourself your uncle dragged from his home and cast into prison; see him arraigned before a tribunal of his country; witness his anguish and the wretchedness of his family; see the blush of shame upon the cheek of his eldest boy; hear the sentence of death! Place before your eyes the scene of execution; the crowd; the gallows; the fatal cart; the coffin; the drooping form of your uncle bound and clad in the habiliments of the scaffold; see the—” “No more! no more! I consent!” “When?” “Now—at any time, only save him; this very night. No, tomorrow—tomorrow I will be yours. Will you give me the papers then?” “Yes, the moment the words pass your lips that make you mine.” “Ha, ha, ha! Yes, I will be thine. You will not deceive me?” “No.” “You swear to give me the papers as soon as I have pronounced the marriage vow?” “Yes.” “Oh, merry, merry marriage day! ha, ha, ha!” “Miss Kent, be calm! Your reason is leaving you!” “Calm?” she repeated, fixing her eyes wildly upon him. “Should I not be calm when there is so much cause for joy?” and she sung thrillingly the line— “Oh, merrily rings the marriage bell;” She stopped full at the last word, and said sadly— “But to me it will be a funeral knell!” Satchell approached; his face assumed a look of sympathy. “Miss Kent, be composed. I will save you.” “Save me!” she shrieked, clasping him by the arm and looking him intensely in the face. “Yes, be calm. Do not give way to such excitement.” “You say you can save me, and my uncle too,” cried the poor girl, who had seemed for a moment about to lose her reason; but who now appeared calm at the hope of safety held out. “Yes, both of you. There is a condition upon which you can have the papers; and I have no doubt, seeing that you loathe me as you do, that it will suit you better.” “Name it,—any thing but that!” she shuddered as she spoke; “I can consent to any thing but that.” “Even to become the mistress of Edward Manning!” he suggested, in a cool, deliberate way, that showed how deeply laid had been his plan to reach this point.” “Sir?” “Nay, do not take such quick fire. Remember all depends on your self-possession; it is a great stake we are playing for! I repeat then what I first said, and I wish you to hear me calmly. There is no alternative to the question; you must either become the wife of the detested Simmins Satchell, or the mistress of Edward Manning.” “Sir, I do not know what to say to such words—to such a proposal! I cannot listen; you insult me!” “I do not intend to. I speak plainly, because it is necessary we should perfectly understand each other. The life and honor of your uncle depended on your consent to become my wife. You treated the proposition with as much contempt and horror as if it had been proposed to you to wed Lucifer himself. Instead of forcing you to this union with me, I take pity on you, and propose one that I know will be far more agreeable to you. I know that you loved Edward Manning before his marriage; I know that this event has not diminished your passion; nay, I know that you would this night, were he to come to you and swear undying fealty, that you would fly with him to the world's end. This I know you would do, for it is in your character. Love like yours for him can couple therewith no dishonor, even though no altar hath consecrated it.” “How is it that he reads my soul thus!” she said, half aloud. “He has spoken aloud what has only been thought in the recesses of my being. Oh! why has he mentioned this loved name to torture me?” “You are silent, lady.” “Sir, I know not what to say.” “I will teach you words. Listen: I present you these two alternatives, viz: be mine legally or his freely.” “His freely then, if choose I must! But, sir, strange man! I know not what to term you, how is this to reward you for the surrender of the papers? What are you to Edward Manning? How can this strange compromise benefit you?” “How can you tell but that Mr. Manning pays me a larger price than I could realize otherwise? How can you say that when I find that you will not be mine, that I choose to yield you to him, and take much money instead of little or no love?” “Has Mr. Manning sent you to me?” she cried, her whole manner changing, and her looks full of love and the excitement of hope, as if there was in the world none else but he whom she loved and worshipped. “But no, no!” she answered herself, sadly. “You do only mock me, trifling with the knowledge of my deep love for him. He has no heart for me; he thinks not of me; he has a lovely wife, and she holds that high sacred place in his affections, for which I have sighed in vain. Yet I thought he once loved me; nay, I think he did till he found how madly I loved, and that he discovered in me, perhaps, a recklessness of passion that alarmed his chaste bosom. Oh! how have I lamented that fatal hour when I let him know to what perfect abandonment I was ready to give myself to him. But, alas! he fled; he saw me no more; he loves me not; he despises me and pities me.” These words were uttered as if she had no listener. She seemed to forget Satchell's presence, or heedless of it—perhaps indifferent, in her grief, whether her words fell upon his ears or not. He heard them all. “Why do you speak to me of Edward Manning?” she demanded aloud. “He is nothing to me.” “Yet you are every thing to him.” “I to him?” she repeated, half in joy, half with incredulity. “Yes, maiden, he loves you with the deepest passion,—a passion only equal to your own.” “His wife?” she gasped. “He loves her not. His heart is yours. He has found that her heart is another's.” “Is this true?” “Yes. Outwardly he carries the fair show of love; but he cares nothing for her; and if the truth be told, nor she for him. This mutual discovery, although they have been married but a few weeks, has destroyed their happiness. He now sighs for you.” “Oh, that I could believe you!” “I have proofs.” “When did you see him? how did you learn this? has he sent you to me? did he desire you to see me? Speak, for my heart is bursting!” were her rapid interrogations. “Listen and you shall know all; and I trust that you will yet thank Simmins Satchell for this night's visit to you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. THE YOUNG CLERGYMAN IN HIS STUDY. The young girl bent forward in an attitude of the most eager attention, her hands clasped, her eyes expanded, her body thrown forward, and every faculty awakened by love. “I am sent here by Edward Manning, as you suspect. He commissioned me to speak with you. He is to pay me a large sum if I succeed, much larger than the five thousand dollars your uncle offered me for the papers. You see, now, why I refused that sum. I resolved to retain the papers to use to bring you to Edward Manning's arms. I, therefore, first proposed that you should become my wife, that I might drive you to him! You see what my success has been. But I confess I was not prepared to find you were so ready to chime in with my purposes! I did not account so much on your love for him! I reckoned more on your hatred of me! But now that you understand my object, it is too late for you to recede; for unless you consent to become the mistress of Manning, yon shall be my wife!” “The first, the first! Does he love me?” “Yes. When you have consented in a note to him to become his, you shall have these papers!” “Then tell me quickly what I shall write. But, sir, how am I to believe all this? He is a young gentleman of honor, and piety, a clergyman, and —.” “Were he an angel, it would make no less true that he loves you, and wishes you to fly to him and make him happy. I said I had proofs, here they are.” As he spoke he took from his pocket-book two letters, one of them was addressed “Simmins Satchell, Esq.” He held it before her and asked her if she knew the hand-writing. She started with pleasurable recognition, exclaiming, “It is his!” “Nay, look closely, for you may perhaps discover that it is a forgery,” he said ironically. “It is his, I am sure!” “And whose is this?” he demanded holding up before her eyes the superscription of the other. “It is to me!” she exclaimed joyfully, extending her hand for it. “But whose writing?” “Edward Manning's.” “Be positive! You will, perhaps, say I forged these letters, unless you are satisfied perfectly of the writing.” “I am satisfied! It is his!” “Very well, now I will read to you the first, which is addressed to me. Nay, don't be impatient, yours you shall see as soon as this is read.” He then opened the letter, the seal of which was already broken, and thus read aloud to her, she approaching and looking eagerly over the page: “My dear sir, “I have at length decided, since my last interview with you, to give up all hopes of being happy with a wife I cannot love. My heart, as I told you is with the beautiful Caroline Kent. I dare not see her until I know she still loves me; for I fear that her love may have turned to hatred! But if you can, I wish you to see her and ascertain whether she still retains affection for me. Tell her from me, that I think only of her; and that if she will be mine, in the flowery chains of mutual love, I will sacrifice honor, reputation, everything to her! Before you see her, call on me at eight in the evening when I will see you privately in my library. “Ever yours, E. M.” “Is it possible that he loves me thus?” she repeated with tears in her eyes. “Oh, I will fly to him!” “Yes, he adores you still. I went to see him, we talked over the whole affair; he said that he intended to-day to let his wife go to New York on a visit, but with the intention of never seeing her again! That he should then be alone, and would be the happiest of men if you would come disguised to his house. He will then make known to you his plans for your future happiness!” “Oh, joy, joy? Now let me read his letter to me, sir.” He placed it in her hand. She pressed her lips to the seal, and with trembling fingers broke it. “My dear and not forgotten Caroline, “This will be handed to you by my confident, the bearer, only in case he discovers that you still remember me with affection. Therefore, if your eyes fall upon these words I shall know that I am writing to one who still loves. I have much to lament; I have been deceived and given my hand where my heart would not follow. How could I give that which was not mine to give? I cannot in words upon paper tell you how much I love you. You are dearer to me than any object on earth. If you love me and can forgive the past, forgive me for preferring another to you, I am ready to cast myself at your feet; do not deny me this happiness, until at least, I have seen you and spoken with you and plead for myself. If you will see me, write to me by the bearer. Write and tell me when I may have the bliss of seeing you. I shall wait with impatience till I know my fate! Fear no rival! My hand and heart are free! nay, they are free only to be your slaves. Farewell till we meet, “Yours faithfully, Edward.” 7 The deep, heartfelt joy of love was apparent in every lineament of Caroline Kent's face, as she perused this letter. She kissed again and again the signature, and then looking in Satchell's immovable face, said, “I am ready to go with you.” “But not now. You must write him that he may be prepared. I will take the note to him; and if he will see you to-night, I will return for you. His wife will leave tomorrow; but perhaps he will see you secretly in his library. Write at once your answer.” Caroline sat down with a joy-beating heart, that made even her fingers throb with its pulsations as she proceeded to write: “Dear Edward, “The past is forgotten. Your note has made me the happiest of beings; you ask me if I have forgotten you? Oh, no! you have daily been dearer and dearer to me! I can scarcely write for trembling with joy; I will come to you, I will be yours forever! I have no heart, no thought, no will but for you! Do not delay the bearer, let me see you at once that my happiness may have its sweet confirmation in your presence. “Your grateful and faithful, “Caroline Kent.” “That will do,” said Satchell, who had read what she wrote over her shoulder. “I will at once take it to him.” “Do,” she said, folding and sealing and directing it; “do, and I will await your return. It is not eight o'clock yet; go, and if you return with good tidings I shall forever bless you.” “Did I not say you would bless the day you ever saw me, hateful as I am, my pretty one?” said Satchell, as he took the note, and with an air of peculiar and significant satisfaction placed it in his pocket-book. He then unlocked the door and bowing, was going out, when her hand arrested him: “My uncle's papers!” “True, I had forgotten them!” he said, laying the package upon the table. She caught it up and throwing it into the inner room, turned the key and placed it in her bosom. “You mean they shall be safe,” he said, smiling. “But they are of no further use to me; I have your note and it is price enough!” He then went out, bowing and bidding her good evening. “Has my note and it is price enough,” she repeated to herself as she unlocked the door of the inner room; “what can he mean?” She took the bundle of papers and began to open and read them. She then tore her uncle's name and seal from each, and burned them in the grate. “I will keep these to show to my uncle,” she said, folding them in a piece of paper. “There is no treason in these, and he can then be satisfied that the originals are no more. Now to prepare myself for the meeting, if it be to-night, with Edward. Oh, such joy! How can I realize that he who has so long had my heart, now loves me after all, and is ready to make me his; ready, for my sake to divorce his wife! She who has been the object of my envy and hatred, lovely as she is! But I must hate every woman who loves where I love! He is mine! He sends for me! Oh, such happiness is too much for me. I am to be Edward's at last! But,” she said, suddenly pausing and turning pale and then deeply blushing, “how am I to be his? with what the world calls dishonor! Yet how can I choose? It was either to consent to this or be the legal mistress of this hateful lawyer; One is no more degrading than the other; but I have a secret hope that I shall be his wife, this I shall aspire to be. If he loves not his bride, I will take her place; I too must be his bride. I go not to him, fondly as I love him, voluntarily to sacrifice myself! I have consented to see him, but with the hope that he will yet make me his honored wife. I know that he will; I know that he is too good and virtuous to think of me with guilty thoughts. He says nothing in his note to alarm my fears. The inference was only drawn by this evil Satchell! I know he intends to make me his wife; but, should he refuse, I am his so that he loves me.” Such were the reflections of this young girl, who, it will be seen, needed an element in her character to render her superior to the temptation into which her strong and ardent feelings might lead her. Without a mother's guiding hand, and left from childhood pretty much to herself, and indulged by her “father” in every whim, high-spirited, passionate and independent, without just notices of feminine morals, it is not surprising that she should prove a ready tool to the purposes which the wily lawyer had in view. Her position, too, drawn as she was in the outset either to accept Satchell, or bring dishonor on her father, and then the alternative offered where her heart already was given, present a strong plea in her behalf. But in no case can wrong be effectually pleaded away. In no case can departure from virtue be defended. “It is better to die,” says Seneca, “than to tell a lie!” much more do a greater wrong! Edward Manning was seated in his study; he was writing a sermon for the ensuing Sabbath. It was to be his first since he had accepted the charge of his parish, and he was pouring into it all the impulse of his genius, of his piety, of his eloquence. His study was an elegant apartment, lined to the wall with polished book-cases, with gothic fronts; the windows were heavily and richly curtained. A sofa or rather lounge, was drawn near the fire-place, and soft, luxurious chairs were about. Near the centre of the room stood a large oval table piled with books; at this he was writing, wrapped in a dark brown dressing robe, his feet in Indian slippers. No sound could be heard but the scratching of his pen over the paper; his calm, high brow was expressive of intellect; his clear eye beamed with intelligence and genius. At length he completed his task and threw himself back in his chair, folded his hands and closed his eyes. His lips moved as if he were putting up a prayer for a blessing upon what he had written. An inner door was gently opened; he turned and beheld his young and beautiful bride. She entered with a smile, and her eyes turned from him inquiringly to the writing-desk. “Come in, dearest Gertrude,” he said; smiling, “and wish me joy; I have written my first sermon!” “Then I have come in just in time, Edward! I thought I would not disturb you till you were through; though it was lonesome to be away from you. Do you know that I am going to teach you to write with your wife in your study?” “I don't think I could, Gertrude,” he answered, smiling, and folding his arm about her lovely form. “If I were a novelist and writing a description of my heroine, then your presence would inspire me; I should be sure to paint you to the life; and be assured ne'er author had a fairer heroine than I should have! I should make them all die of envy and despair!” “You are a flatterer, Edward,” she answered, yet looking flattered withal; “now am I to read your sermon?” “Yes, or I will read it to you.” “No, we will read it together,” she said, taking it and holding upon one side while she gave him the other. “You read aloud, Gertrude, I will follow you, and I can then judge best as to its style and subject. It has been my aim to write to the heart more than to the head, as you will see.” She began to read in a low rich tone, and he to follow the words with his eyes and to listen as she read. She had turned but the first leaf, when a ringing was heard at the door. “I hope it is no one to disturb us, we are so happy at this moment,” said Gertrude, looking up. It was his father, Judge Manning, who said he had come in to see if Edward had got through with his “first sermon.” He was of course made an auditor. Gertrude had resumed and read but three pages when a second ringing announced another visitor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My dear sir, “I have at length decided, since my last interview with you, to give up all hopes of being happy with a wife I cannot love. My heart, as I told you is with the beautiful Caroline Kent. I dare not see her until I know she still loves me; for I fear that her love may have turned to hatred! But if you can, I wish you to see her and ascertain whether she still retains affection for me. Tell her from me, that I think only of her; and that if she will be mine, in the flowery chains of mutual love, I will sacrifice honor, reputation, everything to her! Before you see her, call on me at eight in the evening when I will see you privately in my library. “Ever yours, E. M.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My dear and not forgotten Caroline, “This will be handed to you by my confident, the bearer, only in case he discovers that you still remember me with affection. Therefore, if your eyes fall upon these words I shall know that I am writing to one who still loves. I have much to lament; I have been deceived and given my hand where my heart would not follow. How could I give that which was not mine to give? I cannot in words upon paper tell you how much I love you. You are dearer to me than any object on earth. If you love me and can forgive the past, forgive me for preferring another to you, I am ready to cast myself at your feet; do not deny me this happiness, until at least, I have seen you and spoken with you and plead for myself. If you will see me, write to me by the bearer. Write and tell me when I may have the bliss of seeing you. I shall wait with impatience till I know my fate! Fear no rival!

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. THE DISCOVERY. The footman who answered the bell came to the study door and said to the young divine, “It is a gentleman who wishes to see you in private, on particular business, sir!” “Oh, then,” remarked Gertrude, rising and smiling, I suppose we are likely to be intruders. Come, dear Judge, we will go into the parlor, and I will then read the sermon aloud to you. Of course Edward don't care to hear it read.” “Yes, I would gladly Gertrude; but I must see who this is who desires to see me. Admit him, Charles!” “It is probably one of the wardens,” said the Judge, smiling as he followed the young wife out and closed the door. The next moment, by the opposite door, came back Charles ushering in a tall man closely enveloped in a cloak. Edward eyed him sharply, but without recognition. “Are we alone, Mr. Manning?” asked the stranger without removing his hat or cloak. “Yes, sir!” “Shall we not be intruded upon?” he asked, looking round. “No, sir!” answered the young clergyman, surprised. Satchell then dropped his cloak from before his face, and removed his hat. But as his person was wholly unknown to Edward, of course this movement explained nothing to him of the character of his visitor, except that he had a face that struck him with instinctive repugnance. Satchell took a seat, and then, bending over towards the wondering young man, said, in a low tone, and with a cautions, grave manner, “Though I have not the pleasure of your acquaintance, Mr. Manning, I have felt it my duty to call upon you in relation to a painful affair that deeply interests you!” “Pray, sir, what is it?” inquired Edward amazed, and not without some misgiving of evil news. “It is a matter that deeply affects your honor, and as I knew how dear a clergyman's good name is to him, which even the lightest breath of slander can sully, I thought it would be doing you a favor to call on you first before proceeding to extremities.” “Sir, your language is inexplicable! What is it that you would communicate! Speak freely, sir? Conscious of not having done an action in my life that I am ashamed of, I fear nothing, dark as your words are! Pray speak freely, sir!” “What a good thing it is for a man to have a clear conscience,” thought Satchell to himself. “It makes him as bold as a lion. “Well, sir, I will speak freely. When you have heard all you can judge best what course is fitting to pursue. You once were acquainted with a young girl, the niece of Colonel Harwood!” “Miss Kent, certainly! I have known her very well from boyhood!” “You were once particular in your attentions to her!” “Indeed, sir, this is rather presuming on your part?” “It is necessary; but if you object to answering I will take my leave. I called on you merely to save your honor!” “My honor!” “Yes. Hear me, sir! Whether you are guilty or not is not for me to say! As her lawyer I am to suppose you are! Still as your friend, and a friend to the Church, I have thought it best to give you an opportunity of compromising the matter!” “Sir, be explicit!” “I am a lawyer. Yesterday came to me Miss Caroline Kent, and applied to me to prosecute Edward Manning for a breach of promise; making oath that, previous to his present marriage, he had pledged himself to marry her; but, instead of redeeming his pledge, he did, greatly to her injury and shame, take another woman to wife! Wherefore she desires reparation for this great wrong done her at the hand of the law of the land!” “Sir, who are you?” demanded Edward, springing to his feet. “Simmons Satchell, Esq.!” “This is a vile fabrication all! I know your reputation, sir! It is a plan to extort money from me! Miss Kent never made such oath!” “I can prove it, sir!” “You are not in practice in the courts that she should make appeal to you!” “I do a great deal of law business, sir, by playing into the hands of one or two who are in practice!” “The whole is false, sir!” cried Edward indignantly. “I never made any promise to Miss Kent, nor can I believe she has said so!” “I will bring her here to prove it!” “Then she must have suddenly become a most abandoned person!” “Neither you or I have any thing to do with her character! She comes forward and makes oath to a fact. You must either disprove the charge or endure the penalty!” “The penalty? Sir, I am no criminal! I defy both you and this young woman!” answered Edward with a flushed cheek, and his eyes wet with the tears that forced their way at this charge against him. “Very well, sir, I beg your pardon for my intrusion! I thought I should do you a service. Some men would have gone on with the matter, and the first thing you would have heard of it would have been a summons from the court to attend and answer to the charge!” “Oh, God! What fearful cloud is this upon me!” “Good evening, sir!” and Satchell rose to go towards the door. “Hold, sir! This thing seems incredible! Can Miss Kent be so lost!” “She loved you, doubtless, and perhaps you made the promise in a weaker moment, and now, seeing you are wedded to another, she seeks revenge. A woman's vengeance is to be dreaded, sir!” “What does she want? What can have driven her to this attempt to ruin me?” he cried with anguish. “As I said, revenge! You say right in calling it ruining you, sir! Though you may, if you stand the trial, prove yourself innocent, yet it will always be a blot upon you! Half the world, particularly your enemies, will believe it. Suspicion against a man in your profession is as bad in the world's eye as guilt!” “Sir, I feel that it is so. What can I do? What can she want?” “I advise you to compromise the matter!” “I am innocent! shall I act as if I were guilty!” he cried with distressing perplexity. “I cannot do this!” “Then she will prosecute! To-morrow it will be announced in the papers that the Rev. Mr. Edward Manning lately appointed Rector of — Church has been sued for a breach of promise! This will forever destroy you, sir, if it goes no further!” “What can I do? If I could see her, I would talk with her! Perhaps I could induce her to change her mind! This is dreadful, sir! What does she want?” “She would, probably, quash the whole matter for ten thousand dollars!” “Ten thousand dollars!” “A jury would give her half that amount in damages! for you are able to pay it! I would advise you to see her and compromise the affair with her before it goes further!” “The shameful girl! How can she have been so lost! Where is she?” “At Madame Delano's. I will go and see her now, to-night, if you wish. To show you my disinterestedness I refuse to take any thing myself. So that I save you and through you the sacred character of religion from suffering, I shall feel myself amply rewarded. The world gives me an evil name, Mr. Manning, but the devil is not quite so black as he is painted!” “Sir, I appreciate your kindness and consideration for my feelings. I should like to see this young woman!” “To-night?” “Will she see me?” “Yes; but I will bring her here! You had best not go there, lest it should be whispered about. Can't be too cautious, sir! Can you not see her here in the course of half an hour! Is there no secret way she could enter? Your wife must suspect nothing! Wives, be they never so loving, are quick to believe!” “Alas, what a situation for me! Yes, sir, I can see her alone! She can come in by this way! I will show you!” “But write her one line, if you please! She may not come with me without it at this late hour!” Satchell placed a pen, the pen he had written his sermon with, in his shaking hand. He wrote rapidly as follows: “I will see you to-night. The bearer will show you a private way, for I wish no one to see you come hither! I will await you in my study. “Edward Manning. “To Caroline Kent.” Edward then opened a door, and led him out by the conservatory, and thence into the garden, and so to a private gate, of which he gave him the key. He then let him forth bidding him “haste!” When he re-entered his study he was as pale as a dead man. He sunk upon his knees by his chair, and then fell over upon his forehead, and prayed to God not to desert him in that hour of trial! After many minutes he rose up calmer. He soon heard the footsteps of his father and young wife. He tried to compose himself, and succeeded so well that when they entered they did not perceive that any thing ailed him save that he was pale and sad. “You have heard some bad news,” said the vigilant eyed loving wife. “No,” he answered smiling; “nothing of any consequence. How did you like the sermon?” “Excellent,” cried the Judge. “Admirable!” answered Gertrude. “I am very glad. I must correct it, now! So if you please I shall have to be alone soon!” “Very well; as it is not yet nine, Gerty and I will have a game at chess;” said the Judge. Come, dear, let us go into the parlor and leave him alone!” “I should like to be alone until I go out to the parlor, so you won't come near! A foot fall draws my attention!” “Not a mouse shall come within two rooms of you,” answered Gertrude, laughing as she went out. He looked after her, and sighed heavily. “For her sake I will make any sacrifice! A stain upon my good name would break her heart! For her sake as well as my own, and for the honor of the church, I will consent to compound this conspiracy against me! Alas, for Caroline Kent! What evil has taken possession of her heart! She seems depraved! Yet, I have seen that in her character that should not so much surprise me to find that she has fallen! But that I should be the victim of her sin!” In less than half an hour, a half an hour passed by the young clergyman in the most painful anxiety, Satchell entered the garden gate accompanied by Caroline Kent. As he locked the gate, he gave the key to her saying, “Keep it, it will be of service. Now,” he added as they came to the entrance to the conservatory, “you will pass to the left, and come to a mahogany door at which you will rap. He will open it to you. When you see him do not fly into his arms, for he will think he has you too cheaply! Besides, by being cold and reserved you may induce him to marriage! Now delay five minutes before you knock! “I will obey you!” she answered, leaving him and entering the conservatory. How her heart bounded with joy! yet she suppressed her rising emotions that she might assume a gravity that would bring him to offer her his hand in marriage. Satchell passed down the garden, threw himself over the fence into the street, and hurried round to the front door. He rang the bell, and when the servant came, he said to him, “Judge Manning is within, is he?” “Yes!” “Is he with Mrs. Edward Manning?” “Yes, sir!” “Take this to Mrs. Manning without delay! Place it in her hands!” “I will, sir!” “I check your castle!” said Judge Manning to Gertrude, as the servant entered. He placed in her hand a note, very thick, as if an envelope to others. It bore her address. She broke the seal and read, “Dear Madam:” Regard for your honor and happiness prompt me to make known to you what intimately concerns your peace. Your husband has been long false to you! You have proof of it in the enclosed notes to Miss Kent! If you require further proof you will find her now in his study, the usual place of their secret meetings!” A FRIEND. “It is false!” she cried almost with a shriek. “Read that, sir!” she exclaimed, as she glanced over the notes which Satchell had read to Caroline as coming from Edward to himself and to her, with her reply, and his last few lines scribbled to her within the last half hour! All these notes Satchell had secured and enclosed in the envelope. Her eyes comprehended the whole sense of each, though she scarcely saw the words! The sentences seemed written with a pen of fire. It burned her brain to read! She stood by him, and gazed into his face as he read also, first the note to her, and then those enclosed. “It is impossible!” cried the Judge. “But I will go and see! If she is there all is confirmed! You must not go with me, my child!” “I will not obey! I will go with you,” she cried, clinging to him, and ready to fall. “I must know the worst!” They approached the door! They listened! His voice was heard! A female voice was heard! She had been admitted but a moment before. He had offered her a chair without speaking; but she declined it, and said, (just as the Judge and Gertrude were approaching the door,) “I have come to see you, Mr. Manning, as you request” “I am sorry to meet you in this manner, Miss Kent!” he said reproachfully. “I have sent for you to see if I can change your purpose! I know not what has induced you to treat me thus! Come, let me reason with you kindly,” he said, taking her hand! She could not understand his words. She thought they alluded in some way to the past. “I forgive all,” she exclaimed; and cast herself upon his bosom. At this moment the door was opened, and the wife and father beheld them thus standing as if in inutual embrace. Edward was appalled at seeing them, and she, knowing her guilty position in the presence of the wife, broke from him as he was making an embarrassed effort to cast her off, and fled! By the aid of the key she escaped from the garden, and overwhelmed with confusion and mortified pride at her discovery by his wife, she sought to regain her apartments, to shut herself in, and give way in tears to the bitterness of her disappointment! In her mind all was uncertainty and terror. She had caught but a glimpse of the injured wife's indignant countenance as she discovered her, and of Judge Manning's angry brow. She trembled for Edward, and feared for herself! She blamed her conduct, and even censured him for thus exposing her! But had she remained to have witnessed the scene that followed her departure, all her sympathies would have been with Edward.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. THE VICTIMS. The young clergyman, after the entrance of his father and wife, stood paralyzed. His first idea was that they could not have entered at the precise time they did without being aware of the presence of Miss Kent. He began, as soon as he could recover speech, to vindicate himself. “My dear wife, my father, judge me not by appearances. I am innocent.” “Innocent! Oh, confirmed and finished hypocrite!” cried Judge Manning, his eyes sparkling with mingled indignation and contempt. “Do not make your guilt blacker by attempting to defend yourself. I know all, and so does this injured, lovely creature, who is so degraded and unfortunate as to be your wife. But the law will soon restore her to her honorable maiden name. Not a word. Do not advance to speak to her. She is too sacred an object now, sir, for your polluted touch.” “Oh God! this is too much! Such language from you, my dear father, is more than I can bear! I declare to you, and to you, sweet Gertrude, my honored and loved wife, that I am perfectly innocent, however strong may seem the circumstances of my guilt. The mere fact that this young woman threw herself upon my arm should not condemn me unheard.” “We will not condemn you on this fact alone, young man,” answered his father, with withering scorn. “Look at these letters, sir! These proofs are enough to show the world your total depravity.” “Can you—dare you, Edward, deny these letters?” asked his wife, calmly but firmly. He grasped them—looked wildly at them—saw the note he had written among them, and staggered backward, his brain swimming. He saw at a glance the position in which he was placed. “This one is mine,” he said faintly; “but I solemnly declare the rest to be forgeries.” “Edward, do not add to your guilt by denying it in the face of these proofs,” said his father. “Were the letters false, our eyes are not. You will next say we did not find her clasped to your heart. Silence, sir! You have dishonored yourself and your wife and me. From this hour you are not my son! Come, Gertrude, you must go home with me,” he said, taking the unresisting hand of the wretched wife, who from the first had not opened her pale lips, nor ceased to weep in silence. She seemed turned all at once into a beautiful statue of heart-broken grief. Without another word to his son, Judge Manning almost broken-hearted himself, led his daughter-in-law from the study. Edward stood horror-struck gazing upon their departure. He made no effort to detain them; he felt that it was in vain to defend himself then. The next morning the only witness of his innocence and who would have testified to it, had she lived, and who, equally with himself had been the victim of Satchell's vengeance, had disappeared, no one knew whither! When Edward, who in his heart had trusted to her to clear up the mystery, heard this at Madame Delano's door, whither early in the morning and after passing a dreadful night he went, to see her, he gave way almost to despair. He sat down in his study the same day and wrote to his father and wife the whole, so far as he knew, beginning from Satchell's visit to him. This letter did not convince them; for already, no one knew how, a rumor was in the town and reached them that Miss Kent had been murdered! The person who told Judge Manning was a stranger to him, who met him in the street and asked him if he had heard of the rumor, and that “it was said she had been murdered by a young clergyman!” This man was an agent of Satchell's. What a blow was this to the father! His suspicions at once fell upon his son. The rumor ran rife, and the name was openly spoken. Before night poor Edward Manning was in prison, charged with the murder of Caroline Kent. Four weeks afterwards he was tried, and on the most extraordinary circumstantial evidence was found guilty. A body had been discovered answering to hers, a few days before the trial came on, and therefore there remained longer no doubt in the mind of any one of his guilt. From the bar he was remanded to his cell, there to remain until the day set for his execution, which was the last Friday in the month, giving him an interval of about fifteen days. We will now, after so long a review of foregoing events, once more return to Simmins Satchell and his office, and follow him into the locked-up room in its rear, which, in the early part of our story, we left him just in the act of entering. He turned the key and softly entered the dark apartment, with the light in his hand. In one corner of the room, to which she had retreated upon his entrance, stood a female form.[2] [2] The reader will bear in mind, that the events now to be related are all subsequent to the trial and imprisonment of Edward Manning. These, it will be understood, occurred previous to the first introduction of the reader to Satchell in Chapter I. She was young and, though pale, her hair disheveled and her dress in disorder, and her looks expressive of mingled alarm and detestation, she was surpassingly lovely. It was Caroline Kent! Seven weeks, seven long weeks of solitary and terrible imprisonment had she suffered in that room, whose mysterious silence and fastenesses had excited the curiosity both of the little bandy-legged cobbler and the ebony shoe-black, who occupied the rooms below. The African said he had heard strange noises there, and religiously believed it was haunted; to which opinion the little cobbler coincided; and neither had the courage to make such observations as would confirm or remove their suspicions. We have said that when Edward Manning went secretly early on the morning after his distressing interview with his father and Gertrude to see Caroline, he was informed that she had suddenly left, no one knew whither. Thus were his hopes of acquitting himself dashed to the ground; for he had trusted in her generosity to explain to his father and his wife the whole of the circumstances, which to him were as inexplicable as they were fatal to his good name and domestic peace. The next day he was arrested on suspicion of having murdered her; and a few days afterwards a dead body was found in the cemetery at the foot of the Common, which her father acknowledged to be that of his “niece.” This body had a deep wound in the bosom, and as it lay near the wall inside, it was supposed to have been thrown over there by the murderer, after the fatal blow was given. Edward was tried for the deed, and, as we have seen, convicted and sentenced, though the evidence was only circumstantial. But there were false witnesses raised up by Satchell, who took oath to evidence that seemed conclusive of his guilt. We will now explain the agency of this wicked lawyer in her disappearance. When he found that his fiendish scheme had so far been successful that Edward had been surprised by his wife and father, with Caroline clasped to his heart (as it seemed,) he waited outside the garden to receive her, and learn more particularly what occurred; for he had from the lower step of the piazza seen but not heard what had so rapidly passed within the library. “You have mocked me! you have deceived me! He loves me not!” she cried impassionedly, as he addressed her and walked by her side homeward. “Do not be excited. He acted so only because he was aware that he was in danger of being overheard; he knew his jealous wife was always on the watch; he suspected she was listening; he was right, as you saw; and on this account he pretended not to love you. What he said to you, child, came only from his lips, and were intended for his wife's ears not yours; if his heart had had a tongue he would have spoken very differently; and but for fear of his wife he would have received you very differently. You are too quick, therefore, as you must see, to censure me. I have told you only the truth. Had you not his letters?” “I wish I could believe you,” she said, still rapidly going on towards her home. “But his words did seem to come from his heart. No, no! I cannot be deceived; he loves me not. I saw it in every look and tone. He pitied, he despised me; he looked angrily upon me. No, no, sir. You have for some purpose or other deceived me. I have been a fool to trust you. I could almost believe you have made me a tool to destroy Edward Manning; for as he is good and you are evil, you must naturally hate and wish his overthrow. I will tomorrow early write to his wife; I will tell her all; I will show her that her husband is innocent, that I,—I alone, am the guilty one.” “You will?” he repeated, in a deep voice. “Yes, I will. Whether I am your tool or not I have nearly ruined Edward, and I will make reparation; I will clear him of all blame, for I know that he loved me not—that I have been under a delusion—that I have been deceived and betrayed. Do not speak, sir; you cannot make me think otherwise upon this subject than I do. I have been a victim of duplicity. Leave me, sir.” They had now arrived at the gate of the mansion-house. She attempted to enter. “Stay!” he cried, taking her by the arm. “Unless you swear to me that you will not say any thing nor write any thing to Edward Manning's wife, you shall not enter the house.” “Do you menace me, sir? Now do I know that I have been most cruelly deceived! I will bind myself to no such guilty silence. I will repair the injury I have done that noble young man by every reparation in my power. I defy your threats! Release your hold upon my arm,” as she spoke she broke from him, and fled like a hunted deer towards the dwelling. In a few long bounds he was at her side, his huge hand over her mouth, his strong arm about her waist. “Dare to shriek and I will throttle you,” he cried savagely. “Come with me quietly and I will not harm you.” As he spoke he dragged her, or rather bore her swiftly out of the yard, for she had nearly reached the steps of the door in her flight, and hastened along the street. She could not articulate to say whether she would be quiet or not. His huge hand grasped her under jaw and pressed it with pain. She was nearly suffocated for want of air. She struggled; she released his hand and gasped,— “Do not choke me! I will be quiet.” “Very well, then,” he responded; “see that you are. Not a word. Come along and take my arm too, so that yonder watchman may not remark us.” “I will not,” she answered firmly. “You won't?” and he placed his gripe upon her throat. “Yes, yes! I will! Oh, do not kill me!” She placed her hand in his arm. They walked closely past the watchman. She could hardly move along for trembling. She could with difficulty repress the impulse to shriek for help. But she felt pressing against her heart the point of a knife which Satchell took from his pocket and opened, just before they came near the watchman. She held her breath lest she should involuntarily cry out, and the knife should be plunged into her throbbing bosom. The watchman regarded them both closely; he stopped and looked after them, and he then went on his round. “Where are you taking me?” she asked hoarsely, after they got by him, and she drew back. “Come on; don't hang back. If I could trust you I would let you go; but I wouldn't let you free now for a thousand guineas.” “You may trust me. I will do any thing you say.” “Will you? No, I wouldn't believe you,” he said with a sneer. “It is too late now. Besides you would inform against me. I can't let you off. My safety is in your hands. If I let you go all will come out; my revenge will be defeated. As it is, with you safe, all is just as I would have it, if I were the Devil himself. Nothing could have been finer than your throwing yourself into his arms! Whatever little imp, favoring me, prompted you to this crowning act, I know not, but I shall always be grateful to him.” At this moment he turned suddenly a corner into the alley where his office was. The clock at the same moment struck eleven; it seemed to her heart to sound a knell. She shrunk back from the darkness and silence of the narrow passage. “I will go no further. Kill me, if you will, but I will not be dragged by you. Whither do you take me? I may as well be murdered here.” “Resist at your peril! it is but a few steps farther. I take you to my office. Come along. I am not going to injure you, if you will be quiet and submissive.” “I would rather you should strike me dead at once. Release me! I will never betray you. I will—no I will not say I will be silent and let Edward Manning suffer; if I have life I must use it to clear him from all guilt.” “So I supposed. Your fate is sealed!” he said fiercely; and once more gagging her with his hand, he lifted her up from her feet and darted swiftly down the dark alley with her. He reached the door of the old tumble-down tenement in which he had his office; it was open, for it served as common entrance to the rooms on both floors. He groped his way over the broken planks of the dark entry. He heard the cobbler snoring in his bed on one side, and knew from the deep silence on the other that the boot-black was fast asleep. Every thing favored him wonderfully. He reached the top of the stairs. His grasp upon the throat of his victim had become stronger as he approached the door, lest she should make any noise. The grasp in his fears was too firm, and after a severe convulsive struggle she became suddenly as a dead body in his arms. He had suffocated her. He feared she was dead, and a chill of horror came over him. He relaxed his hold, and finding his way up the broken stairs reached his room and entered. He laid her upon the floor, hurriedly struck a light, and with it bent down to look at her. She was nearly purple in the face; but she was faintly gasping. A hellish thought of pressing for a moment longer upon the windpipe passed across his mind. But he trembled so at the idea of being a murderer, that, with a cry of horror, he hurriedly proceeded to make efforts to bring her back to consciousness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. THE LOVER'S STRATAGEM. After ten minutes constant exertion, Satchell had the satisfaction of seeing his victim come to her senses. His joy knew no bounds when he beheld her open her eyes and look round, wildly and bewilderingly, indeed, but yet with life and consciousness. He had feared he had killed her, and the horror this fear caused him, no doubt prevented his doing so afterward. He had for a few moments of horrible suspense felt, in anticipation, the dreadful sensations of the murderer, and he resolved, now that she had revived, that he would never subject himself to feel so in earnest. He made up his mind that she should live, and lest he should be tempted to kill her he broke his knife blade and cast it into the fire-place. After seeing her open her eyes, he stood back, a little ways out of sight, to watch the expression of her face when discovering where she was. Her wondering wild gaze at length fell upon himself. She uttered a piercing shriek, but the next moment shrunk from him, and casting herself upon her knees before him, with clasped hands and uplifted eyes, besought his mercy! “I have no mercy for one who would destroy me!” he answered, gazing immovably down upon her, his arms folded upon his chest, and his brow contracted with settled revenge. “Where am I? what would you do with me? that you have brought me to this place?” “Keep you from doing mischief abroad! I am not to have my deeply laid schemes detroyed by your babbling. Edward Manning shall bear the infamy that I have caused to be heaped upon his head through you!” “Through me?” “Yes, lady. I have only made you the instrument of my hatred of that young man. He has fallen, and will never rise again! His father will no more hold his proud head above men. I have stricken his gray hairs to the ground. He sees his son dishonored! He —” “Monster!” she cried, her indignation getting the mastery of her fears. “I do not heed names? Words are but air! So long as I have my ends brought about I care not what you think of me, maiden!” “Release me, I beg of you, Mr. Satchell! Oh, do not detain me here!” she cried with touching earnestness. “I will not trust you. No, no! My safety, the consummation of my vengeance, depends on keeping you in security. So, come with me!” “Whither?” she asked, rising to her feet, and eyeing him with a look of fearless defiance. “To the next room, only. I shall keep you there for the present. Your treatment, and your ultimate release, will depend on your conduct and submission!” “I will not go! I refuse to submit to this tyranny!” she answered with spirit. “Very well, we will see who is master here,” he answered; and going to his desk he took from it an old pistol, and presented it against her heart. “Young woman, there is no necessity for compelling me to commit a murder. You had best yield quietly, and obey me. You know me well enough to know that I will stop at nothing!” “Do not kill me!” “Then obey me! Go into this room! The door is open. Do not compel me to take you in!” The hope of being able to escape from his hands ere long, nerved her to meet this crisis, and influenced her to assume the passiveness she was far from feeling. She walked past him into the room, the same we have already seen closely nailed up on the side towards the stair-way. He followed her with a light which he set upon a table. She shuddered as she looked around upon the desolate apartment. The walls were bare; the floor carpetless, and covered with rubbish; the furniture consisting only of a pine table, a chair, and an old sofa, once covered with hair, but now ragged with the stuffing protruding in a score of rents. “Here, miss, you will remain till I feel that I can let you out in safety!” he said sternly. “You dare not—you cannot keep me here! I shall be missed! The world will find me out!” “I shall take care of that! Sit down, and now hear me while I lay down a few brief regulations for your conduct!” “I will stand!” she answered, trembling between terror and indignation. “Have your own way!” he answered with a sneer.” Now listen. My object in keeping you here is to prevent you from informing against me, and establishing the innocence of Edward Manning, which a word from you can do. It is my pleasure to have him believed to be guilty!” “But, I have promised I will be silent!” “I will not trust you! Once out you would not consider a promise drawn from you by compulsion binding. You would also betray me! I have gone too far to go back. My safety depends on your safe-keeping. My revenge will never be complete if you are suffered to go free!” “How long do you intend to keep me here?” “A week; perhaps longer! But hear my laws by which you will regulate your conduct. In the first place I premise by assuring you that escape is impossible. This is a strong room, I have used it as a prison before. Now listen to my commands. I forbid you to scream, or speak above your voice, on pain of death! I forbid you to make any attempt to escape, for if I discover it I will assuredly punish you. Your safety and good treatment depends wholly on your conduct. If you behave well, I will treat you well. Early in the morning I will place a cot in here, more furniture, and make you comfortable. You shall have books also; and I shall place with you and old negro woman to keep you company, and keep watch over you. She will sleep on the sofa, and never leave you. You need not attempt to bribe her, for she is my agent, and will never betray her trust. She will have orders to gag you if you are noisy! Now I have laid down the law, I hope you will be wise enough to obey it; else it will be the worse for you in the end! I now leave you to your reflections. If you wish to sleep there is the sofa for to-night! Now beware any screaming! I will assuredly take your life as I hear your voice in the next room!” With these menaces the lawyer turned on his heel and left the room, double-locking the door after him. Poor Caroline stood where he had left her, as motionless as a statue. Her face was as pale as marble. Tears were in her eyes, but they did not flow. 8 Fear, indignation, wonder, filled her soul. She could hardly realize the truth! She seemed to be in a dreadful dream. “Am I really awake! Is all this so? Am I a prisoner to this hateful being? Let me look around me! Let me put my hand upon this sofa! It is real! Let me lay my fingers upon my pulse! They beat! I am conscious! I am awake. It is no vision! Oh, God protect me! If I have, through my great love for him, done evil, and sinned against thee, forgive me, and bring me not into judgment greater than I can bear!” “Hist, there!” sounded the stern tones of Satchell's voice from the outer room. She shuddered, and laid her hand over her mouth with fear. She tottered to the sofa, and sunk upon it! She began to weep bitterly. By and by, her head sank upon her shoulder, and she fell into a deep sleep. He softly opened the door, and stood gazing upon her beautiful, pale features. “Poor child!” he said with some feeling of pity in his bosom; “poor child! I pity her; but it is her own fault. She should not have alarmed me by saying that she would go and undo all that I have done. Well, it shall be but for a few days. This young clergyman will be accused of her death, for that I shall manage as deeply as I have done the rest. When he is thrown into prison! Then will my revenge against Judge Manning begin! When he is convicted by a jury of her murder then will my revenge be ripening; but it will only be mature when, with these eyes, I can see him swinging upon the gallows. Then that man's heart will break, and my vengeance be crowned with the fullest fruition that earth can give to revenge! Sleep on, child! You will need rest to go through with patience what is before you!” With these words he left her, and locking the door reentered his own apartment. The next morning he performed his promise. He placed furniture in the room to make her situation, as he sneeringly said, more comfortable, gave her books to enable her to while away the time, and also introduced to her a negro woman with a countenance revolting from its lines of vice and insensibility to every gentle human feeling. Under her care, and in this close imprisonment, Caroline remained several weeks, till at length she began, as if from despair of ever being rescued, to be reconciled to her lot, and to bear it with as much submission as was in her power. She knew nothing that was going on. Of the arrest of Edward for her murder she had not heard a word. She was in a state of suspense and uncertainity in relation not only to herself but others in whom she was deeply interested. She wondered, indeed, that her tyrant should be able so long to detain her undiscovered. But she was ignorant of the means he had resorted to to prevent curiosity from being exercised upon her disappearance, in having placed the mutilated body of a young female taken up from a grave with her own clothes put upon it, where it could be found and be taken for hers. This horrible fact she was wholly ignorant of. In the meanwhile Edward went to prison, and from the prison to the bar of his country to be tried for his life, for her murder. He was convicted, sentenced, and remanded to his cell, to await his execution. Of all these proceedings the poor girl was ignorant, enduring with a sort of submissive despair her own captivity. She was not wholly passive. She had hopes of effecting her escape, and more than one plan had been conceived by her for freeing herself from the power of the evil man who held her in bondage. The day preceding Edward's execution at length arrived. It was that after the night on which the swindling conspirators had met in Satchell's room, as we described at the beginning of our story. The reader will also remember the Poet whose verses had so often interrupted their conversation. This Poet was acting a part. He was a young man of talent, and handsome personal appearance, who had long been attached to Caroline Kent; but, on account of the previous possession of her heart by Edward Manning, she could return him only gratitude for his preference. He, however, continued to love her, and to visit her as a friend from time to time. When he heard of her sudden disappearance from the boarding-school he at first suspected her of eloping; and his grief at the utter overthrow of all his hopes was very great. But when the body was found habited in her dress, and pronounced to be hers by her own father, his grief gave place to wretchedness and despair. At length he resolved to enter the tomb where she was deposited, and take from her head a lock of the bright hair he had so loved to gaze upon as it shaded her fair brow. He gained admittance to the vault. He saw the body, and to his surprise and joy found, by the color of the hair, that it was not Caroline Kent. There was not a great deal of difference, but enough to convince a lover. This discovery confirmed a previous suspicion that the body found was not that of the maiden he so fondly loved. He had not seen the body before its burial. But he was now convinced that it was not the one supposed to be. He left the vault happy, but in a state of the most painful uncertainty. He resolved at first to make public his discovery. Then it occurred to him there might be crime at the bottom of it, and secrecy would be the only way by which he could ascertain Caroline's fate. At length circumstances, which we have not room to follow in their detail, led him to suspect that Simmins Satchell knew more about the fate of Caroline than any other person. He had heard from the proprietress of the school that Mr. Satchell had been to pay her a visit the day before she was missed. The lover also went to call on her uncle, as he was called, and, from words he let drop, his suspicions of Satchell were strengthened: and he made known to the Colonel what he believed was the truth; viz: that Satchell had a hand in her abduction; for that she was dead both now equally doubted. The result was that the two gentlemen conversed confidentially together. Edgar Harwood made known his strong attachment to Caroline, while the Colonel confessed the power which Satchell held over him. It was finally planned between them that the subtle lawyer should be watched. But how to effect this was a difficulty that presented many obstacles. At length it occurred to Edgar, inasmuch as he was wholly unknown to Satchell, to hire a room of him as a penny-a-liner, and under this guise they hoped to find out through his movements what had become of the missing maiden, provided he had had any thing to do with her disappearance. It was resolved at once to proceed to work, and to watch him closely as he went out and came in; and if possible learn her fate; for that it was in some way associated with him, both had began firmly to believe. The same day, dressed in a second-handed thread bare, patched suit, with a bushy uncombed wig, and pen, ink, and paper, Edgar applied to Satchell for a room; and was shortly invested with the sole occupancy of the apartment in which we found him at the outset of our tale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. CONCLUSION. This movement on the part of the lover to watch Satchell, and endeavor to discover whether he was guilty, took place but two or three days prior to the day on which Edward Manning was to be executed. Edgar was anxious to have his suspicions touching Satchell, confirmed or destroyed, before that fatal day; for in the one case the young clergyman would be acquitted by the confirmation, and in the other he would be reprieved; for Edgar intended to proclaim to the world that the body was not that of Caroline Kent. Having succeeded in deceiving Satchell as to his character, he felt that he could pursue his investigations without obstacles. But the first and second day he could discover nothing. He had cautiously followed Satchell out by day, and covertly tracked his steps by night; but he could not find that he visited any place where he was likely to have a captive. Nevertheless, the youthful lover was more and more convinced that the evil lawyer was in some way connected with her disappearance. At length on the afternoon after the meeting of the swindlers, as Edgar was in his room waiting for Satchell to go out, resolved to take this opportunity to search the old rookery from garret to cellar, he heard him unlock a door and go into what seemed to him an inner room. This awakened his attention, for he had several times heard him turn back a bolt of an inner door in the same manner. He listened attentively; he thought he heard whispering. He heard suddenly Satchell's voice raised or rather muttering in a subdued growl. He then heard a stifled cry! he was sure he heard a stifled cry! His blood leaped from his heart to his brain, from his brain to his hand, which he clinched in his excitement. He laid his grasp upon the door of his room to rush out and enter that of the lawyer, when he heard him lock the inner door again, and re-enter his office. The young man paused to collect himself; he let go the latch and for a few moments sat down. He was now sure that the maiden he loved, and for whom he was assuming this disguise, was in Satchell's power, doubtless an inmate of that barred-up room, he had so ofter looked upon with suspicion, and which he had resolved to enter as soon as Satchell should have left his office. He waited for ten minutes in the utmost anxiety and impatience for Satchell to leave his room, which he usually did do about this hour. At the expiration of this time he heard him rise, open his door and go out. Through the key-hole of his own, he could see him descending the stairs; he then hurried to the window of the room to watch him go out of the alley. When he saw him turn into the street at the extremity of it and disappear, he felt the greatest delight and relief. He now resolved to penetrate that chamber and see who the inmate was. If it were not Caroline, he knew that it was some person whom humanity called upon him to befriend; but that it was her he sought he had no manner of doubt. He crossed his room with a light and cautious step as if Satchell could even overhear where he was, and passing out into the entry, applied to the latch of the lawyer's door for admittance. It was locked as he anticipated; but he did not hesitate. In a corner of the dark entry was a parcel of lumber, among which he found a heavy piece of wood. This he caught up and with two well directed blows dashed in one of the lower pannels. Through this breach he succeeded in making his way and entering the office. It was now a critical moment. If Satchell should return he would either be arrested as a burglar, or have to knock the lawyer down to effect his escape. There was no time for delay. He made his way across the lumbered-up room to the door which led into the apartment where Caroline was confined as a prisoner. He rapped upon the door and then called out, “Who is in there?” There was no reply. Caroline had heard the heavy noise made by the breaking in of the door; and not knowing what to make of it, and fearing she knew not what new evil, she remained standing in the floor alarmed and listening. When the voice addressed her at the door, she knew it was not that of her captor; still she did not recognise it as that of her lover. She did not reply; yet there arose in her heart a faint ray of hope that it might be the voice of a friend, rather than that of a foe. But she had been so long a captive, had suffered so much in mind, that her nerves were entirely unstrung; and the least unusual sound caused her to tremble like an aspen. “Who is there? Speak, for I am your friend!” again called the voice without the door of her prison. At the sound of the voice, which was kindly in tone as well as in its words, her heart bounded with hope. She sprang towards it and bending her ear close to it, listened to hear it again. She thought she recognised it; but the idea was too happy for her to cherish. She feared that it might be Satchell feigning the voice to entrap her into some net. She waited trembling, hoping, fearing. “Caroline, if you are there, speak! It is Edgar.” “Edgar! Then I am safe!” she shrieked with wild joy. “It is Caroline! Save me, Edgar! Oh, save me.” “I will! I have come to save you, thank God!” answered the lover. “Can you open the door from the inner-side?” “No. Break it open if you can!” She had hardly uttered the words before heavy blows were forcing the door from its fastenings, and half a dozen good strokes with one of Satchell's iron fire-dogs sent it tumbling into the room, so that Caroline had to step out of the way to escape its fall. The same moment they were clasped in one another's arms. “Ah, what all dat?” cried the negro woman who had slept through all, and was now at last aroused to look after her escaping prisoner. “Who is this, dearest Caroline?” he asked, seeing by the faint light of a taper, the negro woman approach from the obscurity of the room, her eyes glaring and armed with a short cudgel. “It is my horrible goaler; save me from her;” answered Caroline, shrieking and clinging to Edgar. “She shall not harm you;” answered Edgar. “Come with me this way, there is not a moment to lose! When I get you into a place of safety I will learn all about this outrage. I am so overjoyed at finding you alive that I can hardly realise that I am not in a dream.” “You don't car' te gal orf, not you!” cried the negress, springing upon Caroline with an open clasp-knife in her hand. Edgar caught her arm, wrested the knife from her, and taking a cord, which had once bound Caroline's tender wrists, he bound her to the sofa by the arms, and there left her howling with rage. He then half carried, half conducted Caroline out of the room, through the office of the attorney, and shoving back the bolt on the inside, threw open wide the door and escaped with her into the entry. He bore her in his arms down the stairs and hastened a few steps up the alley to a police office, where he felt that she was safe. One of the officers at his request went for a hackney-coach, and in five minutes more Caroline was placed in it, and Edgar by her side. To the officers he made no explanations, but paid them for their trouble. “Which way shall I drive, sir?” asked the coachman as he closed the door of the carriage. “To the residence of Colonel Harwood.” “To my uncle's! Oh, joy, joy! Am I once more free?” cried Caroline almost overcome with the consciousness of happiness. “Shall I see him again? Do I owe this happiness to you, sir?” Edgar briefly related to her how that he had suspected Satchell, and the plan he had adopted to confirm his suspicions now crowned with such triumphant success. He did not speak to her of his deep love for her which had prompted him to do so much. But she felt that it was to his love that she owed her deliverance; and her heart overflowed with gratitude. The carriage at length stopped before the house of Colonel Harwood. Edgar hastened in to inform him of his success. The next moment Caroline was weeping for joy in her father's arms. His happiness who can picture? He received her as alive from the dead. After she became sufficiently composed to converse, Caroline related to them both all of the circumstances, with which the reader is already acquainted. Her testimony was a triumphant acquittal of Edward Manning of the crimes he was charged with; and when she learned from them that the morrow was set for his execution, she could hardly be restrained, weak as she was, from at once flying to his release. “There is full time yet, thank heaven, my dear child,” answered Colonel Harwood; “full time to save him and crush his oppressor. You must take some refreshment and then we will go in the carriage at once to the Governor's mansion, if you are strong enough.” “Oh, sir, I have strength! I can undergo any thing to save him; for I have wickedly been the cause of his disgrace and suffering. Oh, if I had known this about him when I was a prisoner, how much more wretched I should have been! I could not have survived! I cannot take any thing; do not delay a moment! Let us at once see the Governor, that I may tell him all.” Finding that her anxiety on Edward's account was too great to suffer her to eat any thing, her father resolved to drive with her at once to the house of the Governor. There in an interview of an hour, she unfolded to his excellency all the circumstances which bore upon the supposed guilt of Edward Manning, as fully acquitting him of unfaithfulness to his wife by her frank testimony, as her presence acquitted him of her murder. It would be impossible to describe the effect which Caroline's developments had upon those who heard it. The Governor at once ordered his carriage, saying he would go to the prison in person, and bring Edward Manning away to be a guest in his own house, till he could send for his father and wife who had left a few days before for New York, to escape from the scene of his disgraceful death. By the Governor's advice, Colonel Harwood at once rode down to the Police Court and got a writ issued for the arrest of Satchell; and so prompt was it executed, that as Edward Manning was leaving the jail leaning upon the arm of the Governor, Simmins Satchell entered it locked by the two arms by two officers. The lawyer's face was as pale as death. His eyes met those of his late victim, and as at a glance he saw that he was free, and would be restored to his honor and good name again, he gnashed his teeth with rage. The jailor to whom had been given by the Governor, the outline of the facts touching Satchell's fiendish agency in Edward's imprisonment, upon receiving the lawyer into his custody conducted him to the cell which the innocent man had just quitted, and there locked him in, saying, “I never turned a key upon a prisoner with more pleasure than I now turn it upon you, Mr. Satchell. If all is true they say about you, I shall only have a greater pleasure vouchsafed to me when I unlock your door to turn you over to the hangman.” We are now at the conclusion of our story. The same day Edward's pardon or rather innocence, was proclaimed publicly. The joy of Judge Manning, the happiness of the lovely wife of our hero, upon receiving a letter from the Governor, communicating the fact of Edward's innocence of every charge against him, must be left to the imagination of the reader. Edward remained a guest of the Governor until their arrival, when he was once more clasped to the heart of his father while he folded his tearful wife to his own. Caroline wrote and sent to Edward's wife a full history of the whole, concealing nothing. Satchell refused to make any confession. A day was set apart for his trial, but he had not the courage to face those whom he had injured. He strangled himself with his neckcloth, and thus rushed to a bar where suitable judgment for crimes like his could alone be dispensed. The devotion and services of Edgar won the grateful heart of Caroline, and she rewarded his noble attachment with her hand. Nothing now remained to mar the happiness of either party; and if possible, Edward and his beautiful wife were happier than before the affictions which had so severely visited them. THE END.</field>
