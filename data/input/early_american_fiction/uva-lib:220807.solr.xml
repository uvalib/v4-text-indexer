      <field name="fulltext">TO HIS EXCELLENCY HENRY WHEATON, ENVOY EXTRAORDINARY AND MINISTER PLENIPOTENTIARY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AT THE COURT OF BERLIN, THESE VOLUMES ARE RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED, BY HIS SINCERE AND GRATEFUL FRIEND, THE AUTHOR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 2 PREFACE. There are several unimportant anachronisms in these volumes. The Berlin park, at the time referred to by the story, was not the exquisite promenade it is at present; nor has any attempt been made to paint the local costume or manners of the period. It has been rather the intention of the writer to illustrate a principle, and to record his protest against a useless and barbarous custom; which, to the shame of his own country, exists there in a less modified form than the good sense and good taste of European communities, to say nothing of their moral and religious feeling, would sanction elsewhere. Berlin, January, 1840.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE COUNTESS IDA. CHAPTER I. It was on a pleasant October evening, in the year 1790, that the public diligence which ran between Hamburg and Berlin drew up in the evening at the post of the former town preparatory to starting. The clock struck nine. The four strong horses clattered with their heavy hoofs against the pavement, as if impatient to be off. The conducteur blew an inspiring blast upon his horn, and a small but observant circle of by-standers were collected to gaze on the company of passengers, and the animated scene in which they formed the principal actors. The travellers for the night, who appeared to take their places, were only five in number. The officer of the post, to whom it was committed to superintend the departure of the vehicle and its occupants, appeared with a light, a pen behind his ear, and a paper in his hand. “Number one,” exclaimed he. We shall take the liberty here, as during the progress of our story, to render, without apology, into our own language whatever conversation we may have to impart. At the call of “number one,” a young man of apparently five-and-twenty stepped from the surrounding groups. His umbrella and cane were thrust into the netting suspended from the roof of the vehicle; a book, which he had carried under his arm, was placed in one of the pockets; and he concluded by depositing his own person in the right-hand corner of the back seat, usually deemed the best in the carriage. During these proceedings, the young man, by the light of a lamp, underwent an attentive scrutiny from the spectators, particularly that portion destined to be his compagnons de voyage. He was a person of a good appearance and an agreeable enough countenance. He wore a not very handsome cloak, but one which had a warm and serviceable look; and he was no sooner seated than, relieving himself from a travelling cap of blue cloth, he exchanged the same for a stout white cotton nightcap, which gave him a comfortable but not very romantic appearance. It was easy to perceive that, although a young man, he was an old traveller; and even such of the by-standers as counted upon passing the night in a good bed could scarcely help envying him the manner in which he arranged himself for his nocturnal journey. The official's call for “number two” brought forth a lady, respecting whom nothing more definite could be discovered than a goodly equipage of muff, veil, and cloak—making the tout ensemble of a female apparently neither young nor old, but of a respectable rank in life. Her effects had been already placed, and she assumed her seat without delay. A call for “number three, four, and five,” brought into the foreground an English-looking individual of the male gender, as might be particularly seen by his whiskers. A lady hung on each arm. The audience, who silently watched the progress of affairs, gathered nothing more from the appearance of these than that they were travellers well wrapped up from the cold, that they spoke the English language, and that the name of him of the nobler sex was “John.” From the frequent and familiar manner in which the epithet was applied by one of his fair companions, in the various remarks which she found it agreeable to make, she was probably his wife, sister, or near relative; though they among the spectators accustomed to such observations were, from a certain asperity in her tone and manner, rather inclined to set her down as the first. The passengers were at length all seated. The doors were slammed to; the conducteur mounted to his place; the blast of the horn broke above all other noises; the renewed clattering of the horses' hoofs against the pavement was followed by seven heart-rousing cracks of the whip; and the “bon voyage” of the dignitary, whose labours were thus happily completed, was scarcely heard in the general clamour. The diligence dashed on with a thundering noise. Our fellow-travellers were sometimes visible to each other for a moment by the glare of a street lamp or an illumined shop-window, and sometimes in utter darkness. At length the softened sound of the wheels made it apparent that they were off the pavement, and offered an opportunity of conversation to such as desired it. “Numbers one and two” seemed, for the present, disposed to enjoy their reveries in silence. The others were less taciturn. The person who has already been introduced to the reader as “John,” made many exclamations of anger, which were joined in by a hard, sharp female voice. The cause seemed to be an overcharge in the bill, or what at least they deemed such, at their hotel in Hamburg. The gentleman's dissatisfaction was directed against the maître d'hotel and the waiters, while the lady included her husband in her animad-versions. “I knew we should be overcharged the instant I set eyes on the hotel,” said the lady. “Didn't I tell you? I was right, you see!” “Oh, certainly, my dear, you're always right! but whose plan is it to come at all? to give up a comfortable house in London, where people are—are— are at least civilized, in order to come here, and— and—and with these poor savages?” “Good gracious, John!” said the other voice, “you are such an awful fool!” “Oh, certainly, my dear; but—” Here a third person interfered, in a low tone, which seemed the soft and more sensible voice of a young girl. She whispered something to the male speaker. “Who cares if they do!” replied the last. “What is that you say, Mary?” said the lady. “I say, perhaps our fellow-passengers may understand English,” said the young girl, in an under tone. “Yes, indeed! but your father's such a fool; he will go on making a ninny of himself.” “Oh, certainly, my dear! I'm always in the wrong; but whose idea was it to bring the carriage and knock it to pieces before even it was got ashore? I told you it would be broken!” “Pray, madame, do you speak French?” said “number one,” addressing, in that language, his silent companion “number two.” “Oui, monsieur.” “We are fortunate in having such pleasant weather for our journey.” “Very.” “Would not you prefer the seat I occupy?” “Oh non, monsieur.” “Do you go on to Berlin?” “Yes, sir.” “Do you reside there?” “Yes, sir.” “I am so much a stranger on this part of the Continent, madame, that, if my conversation and questions will not be disagreeable, I shall occasionally beg some information as to the objects on our route.” “It would give me pleasure to afford you any in my power,” said the lady. There was a pause. “Number one” was pleased with his companion, although he could not see her. From her voice and manner of speaking during this short colloquy in the dark, he concluded that she was a lady of good breeding, and that he was favoured with an agreeable companion. “I think you said you were a resident of Berlin?” at length resumed the young man. “I did.” “Have you ever been in England?” “I have.” “You speak English?” “A little.” “I shall beg, then,” said he, “to express myself in that language.” “Alas!” said the lady, in perfect English, only rendered more graceful by a slight foreign accent, “I scarcely know whether I can use, with sufficient facility, a language which I have not practised habitually for so many years.” “Really, madame!” said her companion, “I could mistake you for a countrywoman.” “No, sir,” said the lady; “I am an Austrian.” “But you have lived in England?” “Some time.” “Is it long since?” “Twenty years.” “Did you like it?” “In some respects.” “And do you never mean to return there?” “Oh never!” The last exclamation was uttered with a vehemence which apparently the speaker herself did not intend, and, perhaps, was not conscious of. It implied a history, and at once piqued the curiosity and awakened the interest of her companion. “What kind of a place is Berlin, madame?” inquired the young man, after another pause, “and how is a stranger likely to amuse himself there?” “It is rather difficult to answer your question in a satisfactory manner, unless one knows who puts it.” “If my name will throw any light upon the affair,” said the first, good-humouredly, “I am called Mr. Claude Wyndham.” “You mistake me,” said the lady, hastily. “I did not mean to be guilty of such a rude question. I intended to say that, before I answered the query, I should know whether he who puts it is in search of knowledge or pleasure.” “For me,” said the young man, now also in a more serious tone, “I am travelling without any fixed purpose, to see the world, and to fill up an interval of leisure. I should like to perfect myself in the German language, of which I have already some knowledge. I have been also looking towards the army.” “What army?” “That of France, madame. That great nation has awakened my deepest sympathy. The stand she has taken commands admiration; and I wish to join the ranks of a people for the first time demanding their rights.” “I have no pretensions to offer you counsel,” said the lady; “but if I had, I should warn you against such a course. The revolution which has broken out in France gives indications of an alarming kind; and I fear, whatever necessity there may be for reform, affairs may be hurried on with a precipitateness dangerous to the peace of Europe. But we wander from your question.” “Yes, madame. And do you think I shall like the metropolis of the great Frederic?” “Unquestionably.” “Is the society agreeable?” “Quite so.” “May I ask,” continued Mr. Wyndham, “whether you are sufficiently acquainted there to give me Vol. I.—B information respecting the person to whom I bring a letter. Do you know Count Carolan?” “Count Carolan? Do you bring a letter to him?” “I do.” “Well, chance has brought us together in a singular manner,” said the lady. “I am a member of Count Carolan's family.” “Then give me leave sincerely to hope,” said Mr. Wyndham, “that an acquaintance so pleasantly commenced may be continued.” This discovery seemed to place Mr. Wyndham and his complaisant friend on a new footing. They had already been prepossessed in each other's favour; and, now that the lady discovered her unknown companion to be on the eve of appearing in the Berlin circles under the auspices of Count Carolan, one of the leading members of the haute societé; and now, too, that Mr. Wyndham learned that his fellow-passenger was a member of Count Carolan's family, the doubts which exist between travellers, however mutually agreeable when not acquainted with each other's standing and character, were entirely dispelled. There remained yet to be satisfied, however, some curiosity on either side. Who was Mr. Wyndham? and why the sadness with which he had alluded to himself? Mr. Wyndham, on the other hand, wondered what relation existed between his companion and the Carolans, and whether he was addressing a wife, a sister, or a poor relative. She had the ease of manner and elegance of conversation which familiar acquaintance with society confers, and there was something about her which arrested his attention. While these reflections passed through their minds, the coach stopped to change horses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. The change of horses occupied but little time; and, after a few fanciful flourishes on the horn, the heavy vehicle dashed on again at a rapid pace through the shadows of night. “Have you been long from Berlin, madame?” resumed Mr. Wyndham, when they found themselves once more en route. “But a few weeks, to visit a friend at Hamburg.” “You can tell me, then, whether the Carolans are in town?” “They are.” “Have I the honour of addressing a relative of Count Carolan?” asked Claude. “Oh no. I am the gouvernante of the young Countess Ida—their only child.” “You have been long a resident in Count Carolan's family?” “About twelve years; ever since my young pupil required my services.” “The Carolans are agreeable people, I think I have heard.” “I consider myself fortunate in residing with such amiable persons, and particularly in having a pupil so charming.” “The young countess is pretty, then?” “I meant to apply the term less to her personal appearance than to her mind and heart. But she is extremely beautiful.” “And her age?” “Eighteen; but it is her character which renders her particularly interesting to me.” “Desist, madame, for Heaven's sake!” cried Wyndham, jestingly, “unless you mean to make me wretched for life. Do you know you are talking to one who disbelieves in the existence of beings so dangerous? I have numbered them among unicorns, mermaids, and the fabulous images of poetry. Should I encounter such a thing in real life, what would become of me?” “Indeed, if you are going to spend much time in Berlin, Mr. Wyndham,” said Madame Wharton, “I have been rash in colouring the portrait of my young friend so highly; but, before it is too late, allow me to repair my error.” “As far as possible,” interrupted Wyndham, smiling. “Smile if you please,” continued Madame Wharton; “but, before you meet her and enter the hospitable house of Count Carolan, it is proper you should learn a fact which I beg to make you acquainted with.” “Ah! don't tell me—that this formidable Helen is already married.” “No.” “I breathe again!” said Wyndham. “Suspend your breath, then!” said Madame Wharton; “for, although not actually married, she is fiancée; and I think one of your English proverbs runs, `forewarned, forearmed!”' “Alas, then! I am positively not to fall in love?” “Positively.” “And there is no hope that a nameless pilgrim may prove more acceptable than son futur?” “No, indeed!” “For another of our English proverbs is, `faint heart never won fair lady!”' “If the lady had anything to do with it; but here the matter is made up between the friends of the parties. The Count Carolan is a gentleman of much intelligence and merit, but he carries pride to hauteur; and he is so aspiring, as well as the Countess Carolan, that they would both rather see their daughter dead than united to a man not of high rank and fortune. I fear `nameless pilgrims' would stand a very poor chance with them.” “The happy gentleman, then, who has won her, is himself in a high sphere?” “He is Lord Elkington, son of the Earl of Beverly. His father is infirm, and it is generally thought he will soon receive the title and estates himself.” “Is the young countess at Berlin?” “Oh yes.” “And the fortunate adorer?” “Of course.” “And what kind of a person is this fortunate Lord Elkington?” “Lord Elkington is about two-and-twenty; a fashionable, elegant young man, of distinguished manners, and very fond of Ida. He will be able to support her in a sphere of life even grander than that to which she has been accustomed.” “Ah! grander, my dear madame—as if grandeur were happiness! I am sure I wish the young lady all possible good, but—” He paused. Madame W. made no answer; and a slight yawn, partly suppressed, broke from the lips of Wyndham, announcing that fatigue and drowsiness were becoming too strong for even the attractions of the fair young countess. A little shocked at such a breach of decorum, he was about to make an apology, when, by that mysterious contagion which, it is to be hoped, will be one day better accounted for, his companion followed his example. And a sudden short snore, not unlike the snap of a very hungry dog at a piece of meat, proceeding apparently from the person of “John”—who, with his wife and daughter, had, during the preceding confabulation, preserved a profound silence—indicated that it was late, and that the hour of sleep had arrived. The horses were here changed again. Claude wrapped himself well up in his cloak. Madame Wharton retreated yet farther into her muff and shawl; and, ere long, both fell into a slumber, which people who have never B 2 slept out of bed think only enjoyable in that luxurious article of furniture, but which, notwithstanding, may be both sound and sweet upon the broad and soft cushions of a German Schnellpost.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. Hour after hour of the night rolled on, and found our new acquaintances nodding and bobbing to each other in the dark, not greatly disturbed by the frequent change of horses, the sounding horn, and the various other noises which one might suppose sufficient to drive “tired nature's sweet restorer” from any eyelids. Sometimes, on being awakened by the crack of the postillion's whip, or the sudden stopping of the coach, Madame Wharton would fall into a train of reflection of which her young fellow-traveller formed the subject. She had not yet fairly seen him, and her curiosity was stimulated by such a conversation with one of whose personal appearance she had so vague an idea. For she remembered nothing more of him than that he had put on a very comfortable-looking nightcap. She liked him more and more every instant. There was a frankness about him which, while it bestowed, also at once elicited confidence. She had been in the habit for years of seeing many young men in the circles in which the Carolans lived. She had never dreamed of exchanging confidence with any of them, and here she had been betrayed into allusion to topics of a private nature by a feeling of congeniality with one whom, in fact, she had never even seen. There was something pleasing, and even commanding, in his air and voice, which struck her as uncommon. Claude also sometimes, refreshed by a sound nap, would turn himself into a new position, and suffer his mind to run on in advance to the Prussian metropolis; to the scenes hallowed by the eccentricities and genius of the great Frederic, then recently deceased, and to the gay saloons where, ere long, he was to behold the young person whom a lady of such intelligence had pronounced so superior in character and so lovely in person. Like many a sanguine young man of his age, his heart acknowledged a great interest in female beauty, and the sportive warnings of Madame Wharton had not been without effect, although different from that intended. At length the darkness of night began to grow less black, and the stars, by their “ineffectual fires,” showed the matin to be near. The endless plains which form the principal scenery between Hamburg and Berlin became more visible. A gray light fell coldly in through the carriage windows, promising to reveal a more satisfactory view of each other than Madame Wharton and Claude had yet been able to obtain. In the houses of the black, dilapidated stone villages through which the vehicle was whirled with the noise of thunder, lights appeared, and sometimes sleepy heads obtruded themselves, cased in nightcaps, from the windows. Then the early peasants were seen on the road, going cheerfully to their toil, till at length the dusky shadows were fairly put to flight from the sombre earth and now brightening heavens; shafts of fire shot up from the east through the clouds, which, aroused by these heralds, seemed to awake and bestir themselves at the appearance of the sun. The cold night-mists rose from their resting-places in the wide heaths and dark hollows, uncurtaining the silent and almost desert plains, which, monotonous as they were, had, in the eyes of Claude, a certain inexpressible beauty, stretching off into azure distance like the ocean. As length, reddening and brightening as he advanced, the sun rose above the sombre circle which had so long hailed his coming, and shed a rosy radiance over the scene. While Claude watched the magnificent changes going on over the heaven and earth, and lifted his soul in humble adoration of Him before whose brightness the sun himself is dim, the other occupants of the diligence remained locked in profound slumber. Madame Wharton's veil had fallen aside and revealed her features. She was a fine-looking woman of about two or three-and-forty. Her countenance was regular and handsome. Her dress was that of one belonging to the higher classes of society, although modest and unpretending. Besides Claude and herself, there were three other persons in the diligence. The gentleman was a red-faced little man with large black whiskers. His countenance, heavy in sleep, had fallen into an expression of grotesque inanity. The wife was a lady of goodly proportions, who looked as if she had passed her life in breaking “John” into the traces. Upon turning his eyes to the third person (although we do not vouch for the fact that she was the last object of his examination), Claude beheld a really very pretty girl, extremely well dressed, round and graceful in her form, her countenance feminine, soft, and even lovely, and her whole air, though fast asleep, so much superior to what our young traveller had anticipated, that he somewhat hastily took off his cotton nightcap, brushed back his hair, arranged it around his forehead, and made as many other reformations in his toilet as time and space permitted. “I am sure,” thought he, as he indulged himself with another gaze at this innocent face, on which sleep, if it rendered it less charming, seemed to bestow a peculiar grace of its own, “I'm sure this wonderful young countess is not half so pretty.” The coach soon drew up at a dirty-looking inn, out of which a dirty-looking man, with a long dirty pipe, stepped to open the carriage door, as the conducteur, in his usual bad French, put his head in to awaken his charge with, “Allons, messieurs, voulez-vous déjeuner ici un peu?” On meeting at breakfast-table, for which a period of twenty minutes was allowed, the party were drawn more familiarly together, particularly after a cup of excellent coffee had driven away all traces of fatigue and sleep. The renewal of an acquaintance, which had been so auspiciously commenced in the dark, was, by day, all that either of the parties could wish, and, to say the truth, more than they expected. Sober daylight dispels so many agreeable visions which fancy raises in the shadow, that both our lively fellow-travellers were relieved by the result of, at length, a fair view of each other. Madame Wharton appeared advantageously in a room; her figure was tall and dignified, her face by far handsomer than Claude had hitherto thought it, and her manners full of elegance and ease. He could not but again secretly congratulate himself upon the acquisition of such a valuable companion. Nor was Madame Wharton less pleased with his appearance. His figure was taller than she had supposed, and, when he threw off his old travelling cloak, it appeared easy and noble. His countenance was extremely prepossessing even in repose, and, when he spoke, lighted up with mind and soul; and his manners had that indefinite charm which sometimes attaches us to a stranger with a feeling of admiration and even friendship. The rest of the party were presently found to be a Mr. and a Mrs. Digby, with their daughter. The first two were pleased to address some friendly remarks to Madame Wharton and Claude, for whom they appeared to entertain a profound respect, while the latter could not avoid proffering to Miss Digby those attentions which youth loves to bestow, and which it seems but natural for beauty to receive. She was a pretty girl, with a very fair complexion, cheeks tinged with a hue which princesses might envy, and which, when she spoke or was spoken to, heightened into a blush. The reader might also like to know that her eyes, when opened, turned out to be of the softest blue. It hardly seemed possible that so fair and delicate a girl could be the daughter of the two ordinary-looking people who accompanied her. Our travellers were soon interrupted in their breakfast and their observations of each other by the imperative cry of the conducteur, “Allons, messieurs, en route!” and in a few moments they found themselves once more in the coach, much refreshed by the breakfast and the pause in their journey. When they were reseated the conversation was commenced by Mrs. Digby, who addressed herself to Madame Wharton. “Have you ever been in London, mem? It is a very different place from any of those towns that one sees on the Continent.” “Why, you haven't seen any towns to enable you —to—to—a — a — any comparison between them and London,” said Mr. Digby. Mrs. Digby pressed her lips a little more closely together, and, after a quiet look of compassion upon her better-half, said, “I'm told Berlin is a beautiful town. Pray, mem, what hotel do you advise us to put up at?” “Why, although I reside in Berlin,” replied Madame Wharton, “I know less of the hotels than a stranger. `The King of Prussia' is at least in a good part of the town.” “Thank you, mem. That is the very one which our guide-book mentions; but as the guide-book mentions also, in very strong terms of praise, the `Golden Swan' at Hamburg, which we were at; and as we found that one of the most abominable places—a perfect den of thieves—and without so much as a carpet on the floor, and such a nauseous, filthy place, we didn't know how far the book might be trusted. What do you think of the German beds, mem?” “I sleep in them very comfortably.” “Well, mem, I can't say I've been half so lucky. Do you know, mem, I would not believe the gar çong when he told me it was a bed, although I have seen the world, un poo, too. I thought it was a settee. I did, upon my honour, mem, and so, indeed, I found it, for I was in a sitting posture the whole night long. I could not lie down at all, and, besides that, I had a very handsome feather bed on top of me. The fem-di-chambre insisted on it. Ah, mem, if you want to see beds, you should come to England. If you want to see comfort at all, you must come there; cleanliness—doors to the houses —civil servants, coal fires, and Brussels carpets— England for ever, mem.” “Well, there, for a wonder,” said Mr. D., “you are right, my dear. Why, I have neither—a—a —a-eaten—nor—a—a slept since I—I—from London. I never saw such a set of—of—of fools as we've met with; and as for carpets, I don't believe they know what they are.” “That's true enough, John,” said Mrs. D. “Why, how should they?” resumed Mr. Digby, “where, in half the inns, all the pigs and old hens in the town are—are—are—all the time—eh—eh —through the hall and kitchen.” “You should not be quite so severe upon us poor Continentals,” said Madame Wharton, smiling, “because your hotel in Hamburg was not a good one; and as for carpets, you must not forget that the very ones which you boast of so much in England are made in Brussels!” “Brussels, mem?” “Certainly!” “Oh, Brussels carpets! ah, that's a place, then. Is it, indeed?” Madame Wharton looked rather surprised at this unsophisticated observation. “Pray, mem, have you ever seen those relics of Frederic the Great, about which so much is said in the guide-book?” “Yes; they are very interesting.” “They must be, mem.” “I am truly sorry,” said Claude, “to have lost the opportunity of being presented to that great man. His genius will endear him to posterity, and the metropolis, which he so much aggrandized, will long be hallowed by associations of him. It will be many centuries before the world will see another sovereign so good.” “I am not so sure of that,” said Madame Wharton. “His striking character unquestionably commands, and will long continue to command, attention, but I do not know that the true attributes of a sovereign are not of a yet higher and calmer order. Truth is not always conspicuous, nor wisdom dazzling. A sovereign should not so much seek to distinguish himself, as to protect his people. I believe the nation would be happier under a monarch more conscious of the blessings of peace, and the tranquil, but lasting benefits of justice and moderation.” “Frederic the Great built Berlin himself, I'm told, on poles, mem.” “On Poles!” said Madame Wharton. “On poles!” echoed Claude. “Perhaps you mean, figuratively speaking, on the inhabitants of Poland!” suggested Madame Wharton. “Not in the least, I assure you, mem. I mean on regular poles of wood.” “I never heard that before,” said Claude, amused by the oddities of the honest dame. “Didn't you, sir? Why, Lord! it's mentioned in our guide-book positively—built Berlin on Poles!— within a large wall—and then ordered the people to go and live there. They talk a great deal about this Frederic the Great; but I must say, that if he ordered his subjects to do any such thing, he must have been a very curious sort of a king, and they must have been very obedient people. Why, do you think, mem, that I would be ordered about in that way by our old king, God bless him, or any one else? No, no. If he should command anything of that kind to us Londoners, I can just tell you, and him too, that if he did not have St. James about his ears pretty quick, it would not be our fault.” “I think,” said Digby, “you have made some mistake; I don't see how a city could be—eh— eh—on poles, I'm sure.” “No mistake at all, I tell you, isn't it in the book? on black and white, as plain as a pipe stem? and I aint such a fool, I take it, but that I can read.” “Well, I think you've made a mistake,” said Digby, boldly. “John, how can you be such a fool?” “Well, just refer to the book, and see who's the fool then.” “You do injustice to our great Frederic,” said Madame Wharton. “I believe some attempt has been made to raise a building on some piles, in a certain part of the town, where the ground is marshy; but the order of the king was only that a certain space of ground should be enclosed within walls for the future city.” “There,” said Mr. Digby, triumphantly, “who's the fool now, my dear?” “Ah, maybe so, mem!” said Mrs. Digby, rather tartly. “I was never there myself; I only know what I see printed, and our guide-book is called one of the very best, mem!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. I.—C CHAPTER IV. The conversation of a stagecoach is apt to run on at length into a more confidential character than would be the case under other circumstances. Our travellers beguiled their time agreeably enough till the hour of dinner. The loquacity of Mrs. Digby, which might have been tiresome, if not offensive elsewhere, was here an efficient protection against ennui, and a prolific source of amusement. Claude found in these two people an ignorance of things most generally known, which surprised as much as it amused him. It was on the part, at least, of the lady, accompanied with the boldness which is so often its companion. It is only the intelligent who learn to doubt, and have the modesty to avoid coming to conclusions except on good grounds. Mr. Digby continued throughout the day dull and stupid, and Mary silent and blushing. Claude's good-natured endeavours to draw her into conversation elicited nothing more than a change of colour and monosyllabic replies, till at length he gave up the undertaking as impossible. Mrs. Digby, on the contrary, rattled on in edifying carelessness, stumbling every ten minutes into an outrageous error, which, even when by chance she discovered it, did not embarrass her or make her more cautious for the future. She seemed indifferent to every consideration but that of a grand plan of pushing herself into a circle of society abroad, higher than she had been able to get into at home. Both Madame Wharton and Claude were puzzled to comprehend how so much wealth, and the relationship, to which she several times alluded, to the lately deceased Lord Clew, could be reconciled with so little education, and such a singular ignorance of the forms of even third-rate polite life. It was impossible to avoid being entertained by their mistakes. Travelling through a country, with the language and customs of which they were totally unacquainted, and full of the prejudices which many English, even of a superior condition, bring with them abroad, they were always in trouble. Mr. Digby, who had scraped together a few words of French, found it impossible, as he said, to make those fools understand him; and, at every new object which met their eye, and of which they did not understand the use, they were clamorous in their expression of their surprise or indignation. On many occasions Claude obligingly acted as their interpreter, the more readily as the modest Mary looked her gratitude in a very obvious manner, although she had not yet found courage to put it in words. On stopping for dinner, towards the close of that meal Digby begged Claude to call for some beer, and the attention of the strangers in the room was attracted by his exclamation of, “Ho la, what the devil's the fool at now?” called forth by the appearance of the Prussian beerglass, which, without being greater in circumference than a common tumbler, is about two feet in height, for the purpose of affording room for the superabundant foam of that pleasant beverage. On tasting the beer, which is of the lightest kind, more resembling ginger-pop than the solid drinks which pass by the same name in London, he spit it out with disgust, protesting that the idiots had given him poison. He then insisted upon Claude's calling for some “strong ale.” The waiter shook his head in profound ignorance, though not without a broad grin, and Digby swore he was more than ever convinced that the “people of the Continent were only half civilized.” In the midst of his expressions of disappointment, the inevitable “Allons, messieurs, en route!” called them to resume their journey before he had half finished his dinner. Although he had eaten less, yet, owing to his hurry and ignorance of the money of the country, he was obliged to pay more than any of his fellow-passengers, and he kept the diligence waiting till the conducteur addressed him with a loud protestation and an inflamed countenance. Reseated in the carriage, he commenced a tirade against Germany and the Germans, their towns, inns, beds, manners, and customs, among which their beer was not forgotten. Mrs. Digby, at length, after telling John to hold his tongue, and that he was an “awful fool,” appropriated Madame Wharton to herself, and talked down that lady's few polite efforts to keep up a conversation with an untiring energy, which might have been annoying, had not the good dame's loquacity been seasoned with so much food for mirth. It was not long before, warmed by exertion, she began to give an account of her past life and future plans, which let her auditors a little into the mystery which had so perplexed them. “I assure you, mem,” she continued, “our history is very interesting, and, for want of better amusement in a stagecoach, I'll tell it you. You see, mem, Mr. D., though no one would think so to look at him, poor man—” “Thank you, my dear,” said Mr. Digby. “You see, mem, Mr. D., as I have, I believe, told you before, is a relation of the late Lord Clew. I suppose you have heard of Lord Clew, mem?” “No, I do not think I remember him.” “Well, mem, by that means, a few years ago, we came into possession of about £100,000.” “A pretty affair!” said Claude. “Wasn't it, sir! I assure you, however, as far as want goes, I never did; for we were in an excellent business—which is neither here nor there, mem. We didn't even know that Mr. D. was related to my Lord Clew, any more than the child unborn; when, one day, as we were sitting down to dinner— I remember it as if it had been yesterday; don't you, John?” “To be sure I do!” “A good dinner of mutton and turnips, with mint sauce.” “And a hearty tankard of foaming ale,” interrupted Digby. “Rap, rap, rap, rap, goes the knocker,” said Mrs. Digby. “A little old gentleman was let in and taken into the back parlour, wanting to see Mr. D. He was a gray-haired, hard-looking old gentleman, of about three or four-and-fifty or so—says he, `I want to see Mr. Digby—Mr. John Digby!' `That's your man,' says I. Now anybody else might have been afraid that he was a sheriff's officer, or something of that sort, but not so I; for, as I told you, we were in good circumstances, and I didn't care the tip of my finger for any sheriff's officer of them all. `I want to see Mr. John Digby,' says he. `That's your man,' says I. `My name is Abraham Hand,' says he. `Is it, sir?' says I. `Then maybe you'll take a seat?' says I. `Mr. Digby's father's name was Samuel?' says he. `It was so,' says I. `And he came from Birmingham?' says he. `That's as true as if you'd read it out of a book,' says I. `And you, I take it, are Mrs. Digby,' says he. `At your service,' says I. `Well—”' “And this was Lord Clew?” said Madame Wharton, when her companion paused a moment to take breath. “I beg your pardon, mem,” continued Mrs. Digby, with some dignity. “I beg your pardon; it was not my Lord Clew, by no manner of means— for he was dead and buried, poor man—but it was one of the most curious characters in the known world. It was a person who, although no lawyer, has spent his life in courts of justice and such places, and who keeps one eye on all the great families in the kingdom, and the other on all the wills— C 2 and other registers of property. He knows the state of everybody's fortune, they say, better than they do themselves; and where it came from, and where it is to go, particularly everything that has been tergiversated in courts of justice—or chancery I think they call it, mem.” “This is singular,” said Madame Wharton. “I think I have heard of some such person,” said Claude. “Very probably, sir. Now you'll observe, mem, in such a stupendious place as London, there are some people who don't know their own rights, or who they really are; and I'm told this individual not only often has the pleasure of being the first to inform people that they have fallen heirs to large estates, but that, in the course of his explorations amid old wills and other parchments, he frequently lights upon property bequeathed or reverted to people who neither court, nor jury, nor chancellor, nor anybody else knows the least thing about, and whether they are alive or dead, or in the country or in foreign parts, mem.” “This is really remarkable,” said Madame Wharton. “Isn't it, mem? It turned out that Mr. Digby, poor creature, was a distant relation of Lord Clew's, without any one's knowing anything about it. My lord himself knew there was such a relation living, but had never taken the pains to ferret him out, and died suddenly without a will. I'm afraid I don't give a very clear account of it, but it all fell out right, and we left it entirely to our solicitor, who soon found matters to be just as Mr. Hand had said. Mr. D. gave Mr. Hand £1000 like a great fool, when, as I told him at the time, £100 would have done just as well; but we received our £100,000, and a very agreeable thing it was, I can assure you, mem.” “Your story is like one of the Arabian Nights,” said Claude. “Night or day, sir, so it was; and we were much obliged to Mr. Hand, who has been a great friend to us ever since, and is, in fact, even now a sort of agent of ours; for he knows more about law and such things, I believe, than all the lawyers put together. Now, mem, my passion is society. Mr. D. isn't fond of it, but I am never easy unless I'm in the bong-tong. This is one of my objects in coming to Berlin; and, if you can make us acquainted with a few genteel families—the Carolans, and such kind of persons—in case of your coming to London, I'll promise to return the compliment. I have been told that we should enjoy more facilities in the society abroad than at home. I don't know how it is, but the London society is very difficult. They're a proud set, and go in clusters like swarms of bees. We never could git acquainted with our own countrymen, even when they lived next door to us. We have brot letters to Mounseer Godeau— you know them, doubtless. They are very high people in Berlin, I'm told, mem, and will introduce us also everywhere into the ho-tong. Pray, how do they stand there, mem?” This long harangue being at length brought to a conclusion, she paused a moment, partly for breath, and partly for an answer to one of the various questions contained in it; but, by a slight sound from Madame Wharton, she perceived that that lady had fallen asleep. The second night in a diligence is generally more easily got through with than the first. Fatigue of body and mind produces an inevitable disposition to sleep, and one becomes so accustomed to the usual incidents and interruptions that they no longer form any obstacle to repose. At length Mrs. Digby's everlasting tongue stopped, and all sank to sleep. The night rolled away, and the travellers were whirled rapidly on, doubtless edified by their respective dreams. Those of Mrs. Digby were of sweeping trains, nodding feathers, and long robes of satin and velvet, with a magnificent young lord at the feet of the ever-blushing Mary. The fancy of Mr. Digby reverted back to less prosperous, but, alas! more happy days, before fortune had elevated him to the troublesome necessity of being “genteel.” Claude, so much had they talked of the celebrated town they were approaching, glided in imagination through its streets, with temples, columns, and domes everywhere around him; while Madame Wharton herself was once more young and lovely—the admired and observed of all—treading through scenes which Time, that ruthless and ever-busy robber, had long borne with him into his own dark realm of the past. What had recalled to her those longforgotten times? What had awakened in her imagination the images of a reality which she had ever wished to turn away from, or to regard as empty dreams? By some strange and subtle association, the phantoms of vanished years had started up once more around her, and encircled her with the happy and long-faded hours of youth, and hope, and joy. At length the morning broke, and the idea of being so near their journey's end aroused the sleepers at an early hour. Claude turned his eyes towards the dim, indistinct scenes flying past the carriage window, and, letting down the glass, admitted the cool, refreshing air. He began already to experience that pleasing sensation with which one enters, for the first time, a great foreign city. His mind was stored with historical associations of the great men who had lived and who still live there. The approach to the capital, after his long travel over the desert and apparently endless plains in which northern Germany inclines towards the Baltic, seemed like nearing land after a sea-voyage. Traces of a neighbouring population began already to manifest themselves. Better houses, more cultivated gardens, thicker and more regular avenues of trees, higher walls, and various other tokens, not only of the proximity of a large town, but of royalty itself. As the Schnellpost entered the little village of Charlottenburg, these indications grew more numerous and striking, till the chateau and its beautiful grounds broke upon his eyes, looking in that early light like a scene of enchantment. “This is very pretty and striking!” said Claude. “The chateau is, of course, a royal residence?” “It was built by his late majesty,” said Madame Wharton. “What late majesty, mem?” demanded Mr. Digby. “Frederic the Great!” “Dear me, how new it looks,” said Mrs. Digby. “New?” “Certainly, mem. I did not know that any houses built by Frederic the Great could yet have as new an appearance as that.” “And why not?” “Why, I thought he lived a long time ago—in the time of Brutus, and those fellows!” The carriage now entered the Thiergarten, or Berlin's Park, a beautiful and thick wood about three miles in circumference, lying immediately outside the city walls and the principal gate. The pretty river Spree, a branch of the majestic Elbe, after meandering through the city, comes bending into the Thiergarten, bearing its cool breezes in summer into the sylvan recesses of the wood, and then stealing in to bathe the terraces of the Charlottenburg chateau. From this river, by the taste and care of royalty, streams are led in many devious ways through the grounds, winding by and beneath what the stranger thinks the prettiest banks and bridges he ever saw. Carriage roads, lanes for equestrians, and footpaths lead the eye and tempt the feet in a thousand different directions; while the great road, as straight as an arrow, runs directly through the forest to the Brandenburg gate, one of the chief architectural ornaments of the city, and, perhaps, the most magnificent portal in Europe. Our travellers at length approached the walls, and caught the scenic view through the tall columns of this gate. The rising sun sent its beams through the forest arcades (which, even at this season, from the brightness and clearness of the day and the number of evergreen trees, preserved something of the effects of summer), and tipped with gold the colossal bronze figure of Victory and her four horses on the top, which has since witnessed such remarkable changes, and even acted its part in the vicissitudes of this interesting country. The city population were now fairly forth in moving crowds. Peasants, labourers, milkwomen with their little dogcarts, soldiers, officers, sentinels, and droskies appeared on every side. Suddenly a band of martial music burst upon them, and a large company of infantry were marched out of the gate; while a troop of cavalry, their helmets, swords, and cuirassiers glittering in the sun, dashed rapidly off in another direction. This great military government, ever destined to support a brilliant army, was now animated by the prospect of a war with France; a war whose interminable duration and eventful consequences, how few of all then living could foresee! The carriage, in passing the gate, entered a large square, through which double rows of trees seemed to continue the wood into the bosom of the town. While the custom-house officers were examining the passports, Madame Wharton informed them that the street they were entering was called the “Linden,” and pointed out the residences of several distinguished people. They had time, however, for few observations. The diligence almost immediately dashed on once more, and, after a considerable ride through the town—which, from the hasty views caught of it, the vistas of long streets, and glimpses of churches, statues, bridges, and columns, seemed a city of palaces and temples—they reached the poste. It was Claude's intention to attend Madame Wharton home in a public coach; but, as he was about making the offer, she saw Count Carolan's carriage waiting for her, and a chasseur, in rich livery, advanced to take charge of her. They therefore bade each other adieu, and with a warmth which showed to both the mutual sentiments of esteem and friendship which had arisen between them. “Remember,” said Madame Wharton, “you have already half chosen me for your Mentor; and really, in the scenes through which you are about to pass, you may find such a companion, although sometimes troublesome perhaps, not altogether useless.” Claude promised to take the earliest occasion to see her; and then, at their earnest request, accompanied the Digbys to the Hôtel du Roi de Prusse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. Few pleasures are more agreeable than the first arrival in a foreign city in good health and bright weather; the change of toilet, the leisurely breakfast at a comfortable hotel, after the hurry and fatigue of a journey; and “last, but not least,” the ramble through the town, amid things strange, fantastic, and hallowed by historical associations. After an excellent breakfast and a change of toilet, which much improved the appearance of our young traveller, he prepared to sally forth and see the town. As he intended a considerable stay in Berlin, he required a servant; and, ignorant of its localities, he concluded to procure one, if possible, at once. Accordingly, he made inquiries of the waiters, and was informed that there was then in the house a valuable domestic, just by chance out of place, and who would immediately present himself. Claude decided to employ him for the day, and, if he liked him, to keep him. A modest knock at the door presently announced a young man of agreeable countenance and altogether prepossessing appearance. He was well furnished with recommendations from a host of counts, barons, and ambassadors, with whom he had lived different periods of time, and who pronounced him everything that was honest, zealous, active, and faithful. His manners were engaging, and even what Mrs. Digby would have called “genteel.” He was obviously modest and intelligent, and Claude liked him at a glance. “You are a Berlinian?” “Yes, your excellency!” “Do you understand English?” “No, your excellency!” “You are, of course, well acquainted with the town?” “Perfectly, your excellency!” “I will employ you to-day,” said Claude; “leave your certificates. I will look them over, and perhaps I will take you permanently into my service.” “Monseigneur is very good.” “Get ready to go out with me: I wish to walk through the town. If you do not already know the address of Count Carolan, find it. And—don't call me `excellency,' or `monseigneur,' but plain monsieur.” “Pardon, monsieur—milles pardons.” “Your name?” “Carl, monseign—monsieur.” Claude was pleased with the simplicity of this young man. There was about him an air of artlessness and good-nature which promised well. Accompanied by him, he commenced his first ramble through the town, then peculiarly interesting to strangers from the brilliant and recently-closed career of the great military genius who had rendered the Prussian army formidable to Europe. Claude's first care was to leave his letter of introduction at Carolan's. The count resided in an imposing mansion, which had a palace-like and almost royal appearance. It was covered with sculpture. The large court in front was adorned with vases and statues, of which also a row looked down from the ridges of the roof. An open archway revealed the vista of a garden in the rear, extending back indefinitely, and thickly planted with trees and shrubbery in the English style. Several serving-men in livery were lounging by the broad door. It was at once recognised as the residence of one of those grands seigneurs who live in the midst of royal splendour without the grave cares and heavy responsibilities of a throne. “And so, then,” thought Claude, as the tout-ensemble of this princely residence rose upon his eye, and he caught through the windows indistinct views of the interior magnificence—angles of large paintings hung against the walls, snowy statues, golden ceilings and shutters, and gorgeous curtains—“this is the home of her whom Madame Wharton describes as so beautiful and superior.” “Where will monsieur go next?” said Carl, who had been standing some time with his hat in his hand, and who had concluded at length to interrupt a revery which did not seem likely to have any particular termination. “Show me the town,” said Claude. “I wish to see only its exterior to-day. Whatever there is most attractive to a stranger.” Vol. I.—D Carl led the way through streets celebrated for their architectural magnificence, the principal objects of which the guide-books will give more in detail than it would be possible for us to do. Suffice it to say, that he was struck with the magnificence of everything around him. Fountains which threw their sparkling waters high into the air; ample squares; level streets; long lines of sculptured facades, temples, palaces, churches, statues, columns, porticoes, and bridges, in a stately order, which recalled the imperial splendours of old Rome, when Augustus and Vespasian delighted to adorn the capital. Among the rest, the large royal palace or Schloss, a vast edifice, imposing from its size and position, lifted its towering walls against the sky. Carl pointed out each edifice and object worthy of remark, and gave the necessary information respecting them with respectful attention. While they were thus employed, several elegant equipages, each drawn by four horses, with outriders and postillions, and all the pomp of royalty, drove by, their occupants receiving the universal salutations of the crowd, and returning them with great affability. Among others, that of the king, the father of the present beneficent sovereign, was announced by a low-toned expression of Carl's, “Monsieur—sa majesté!” and a yet more reverential salutation. “Ah, well!” thought Claude, as everything wore a bright aspect through the atmosphere of an unusually clear day, “I have got here into a very pretty town, and I will not leave it till I have laid out for myself a plan of future conduct. I will no longer sigh over the sad mystery of the past. I will adopt some certain and honourable employment; and, if nothing better presents itself, I will even make my way into France, and aid that rising people in the pursuit of national happiness. In the mean time I am young, in health, my own master, and, at all events, for the present, independent. Let me improve my time while I can. Why should I suffer one secret misfortune to overbalance all these advantages? He is the true philosopher who enjoys life while he can, and quaffs the foaming drink before the sparkle leaves the brim.” While passing through a street on their way home, they were interrupted by a group of several persons around a print-shop window, where a number of engravings and pretty paintings were the objects of attention. “Will monsieur pass in?” said Carl. “There are often very pretty things here. All the Berlin societé visit this shop.” Casting his eyes through the door, he was struck with some soft landscapes, and, stepping across the threshold, he became too much interested to retire without seeing the whole collection. Leaving Carl, therefore, at the door, he entered; and perceiving— by the little attention his appearance occasioned, and the three or four other persons, apparently strangers like himself, also engaged in their examination —that it was a kind of public exhibition, he yielded to the charm which he always found in works of art. Paintings to him were another, a newer world, created by the mind of the artist out of the wide materials of this. There, all is either grand, or soft, or wonderful. The yearnings which the mortal has after something above the rude masses amid which even the fairest things lie half buried, are there unobscured. He who feels art finds an enchanted world in a picture gallery. The homeliest commonplaces there have a beauty not seen before; it unlocks the secret sweetness of things; opens their hidden meaning, draws aside the veil, and makes the narrowest mind behold how beautiful are even the homely ground and rough rocks— the every-day trodden shore—the river that, in our business hours, flows unregarded at our feet—the rain-washed angles of old houses—the sky—the clouds—the very air. Claude gazed around him with these reflections. Suddenly he found himself by an open door, which led into a smaller apartment or little cabinet, also filled with pieces, apparently of a more valuable kind. At the end of this room, in a conspicuous place, and where the light fell across it with the best effect, was the portrait of a young girl, so beautiful, that he paused before it, and became presently unconscious of everything else. It equalled, and went beyond his idea of complete female loveliness. Nothing could be more simple. A light but modest drapery fell around the form. There was no ornament about it. He could not tell whether it was a princess or a cottage maiden. There was nothing on the canvass but youth, innocence, happiness, and beauty. His reveries were interrupted by a sigh. On turning, he observed at his side a young man who had before escaped his attention, and who, possibly, also supposed himself alone. He was about the middle height, slenderly formed, with a pale, melancholy face. His hair and brows were black, and he wore a large mustache. There was nothing remarkable in his physiognomy except his eyes, which were dark and large, and uncommonly brilliant. His hat was worn low over them. His clothes were old and faded. He was evidently very poor. “This is quite pretty!” said Claude, with a desire to relieve the embarrassment which the stranger appeared to feel on perceiving that his sigh had been overheard. “Yes, monsieur, quite.” “Can you tell me who it is?” “No, monsieur.” “Do you know the artist?” “Yes, monsieur—no, monsieur.” “Can it be from nature?” continued Claude. “No, monsieur,” said the stranger, “I believe it is a fancy piece.” “Ah, very probably—and yet—it is a great pity —for—” He turned, and with some surprise observed that his companion had disappeared. Carl, with his usual bow, now approached, and reminded him that the dinner-hour was four, and that it had already arrived. Tired with his long ramble, for there are few kinds of toil more laborious than sight-seeing, the calls of appetite began to counteract the claims of imagination, and he left the pair of tender eyes to be gazed upon by some less hungry admirer. As he approached the hotel, all minor considerations were merged in the more important one of dinner. The fumes of the fragrant dishes already drove less substantial enjoyments from his mind; and it may be recorded of our hero, without the fear of contradiction (should any curious reader choose to examine the manuscripts deposited in “la Bibliothèque du Roi,” from which we have drawn the materials of this history), that, notwithstanding his habit of sentimentalizing before palaces, paintings, &amp;c., which might lower his reputation with our more practical readers, he did nevertheless partake, with as little delay as the ordinary usages of polite life permitted, of a hearty meal, during the whole period of which he was in a state of beatitude as lively as when melting before the art of the cunning painter. It is farther set down, that a half bottle of “chateau la Rose,” or some beverage equivalent (for here there is a blot in the manuscript), which the waiter brought full, and placed by his napkin at the commencement of the dinner, was, in the course of an hour, so altered in its condition, that the said waiter, on carrying it to the kitchen and turning the same up-side-down, with the neck slightly resting between his lips, found nothing there sufficient to repay him for his trouble.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">D 2 CHAPTER VI. On the day of Claude's arrival in Berlin there was a ball and supper at Count Carolan's. The company assembled at nine, and the elegant apartments of this distinguished nobleman were crowded with the beauty and fashion of the town. In this brilliant atmosphere, the important questions of the day were discussed with smiles and jests. The war with France—the revolution—the politics of England, were all alluded to gayly; while, with diplomatic caution, nothing either one way or the other was said about them. Some played cards—some strolled about—crowds pressed to the ballroom, where, conspicuous for her loveliness, the young Countess Ida was led to the first dance by Elkington; while Lady Beverly, a tall, dark-looking woman of considerable beauty, although a little faded, with black and large eyes, and a countenance, through all the smiles of fashion, care-worn and anxious, sat down to whist. The principal topic of conversation, however, was Ida and Elkington. They were such a striking couple. The match was such an admirable one. Was it settled? When would it take place? and a hundred other questions were asked and answered in various ways. In the mean time, Elkington exerted all his powers of fascination to render himself agreeable to his lovely companion. This was the evening he had fixed upon to solicit her consent, that of her father and mother having been before obtained, on condition of his being able to procure hers. The young girl was obviously flattered with her influence over a person so distinguished. She listened to his gay and fluent conversation with delight. She heard him breathe sentiments of refinement and honour, and she knew that he was regarded with favour by her parents. When he leaned towards her, she scarcely turned away; when he held her hand in his, she did not withdraw it. The music floated around her—the glittering images of the dance, and forms of splendour and pleasure passed before her. Ignorant of his heart—ignorant of her own and of the world, she knew not that she was capable of a deeper feeling than the tranquil satisfaction which she experienced at the attentions of her lover, and the pleasure she saw their union would give to her parents. At length the dance was over, and the young girl, trembling at the tenderness of Elkington's manner, and at a crisis in her life so new and interesting, withdrew from his too ardent flatteries. She passed through half a dozen saloons. Never had she looked so beautiful. There is something in the first approaches of love which sheds a soft and dangerous sweetness over even a homely face. What was the charm which it added to that of Ida! She wished to withdraw from every gaze, and most particularly from that of Elkington. With this intention she hastened through two or three more rooms (now deserted, for the company had crowded into the ballroom) into a little exquisitely furnished boudoir, shaded with vines, and odorous flowers and plants, where a dim light intentionally left all in a shadow peculiarly grateful to the eye after the glitter and glare of the ballroom. By chance she found the boudoir unoccupied, and she entered a recess—half bower, half grotto—at the farther end. Here she sat down alone. The momentary solitude was delicious to her. The darkness soothed her eyes. The silence, coolness, and motionlessness, after the flashing and shifting images of the crowd, sunk into her soul with the breath of the flowers that leaned fragrant and cool around. Her head was bent down upon one hand, the other hung by her side. She remained lost in thought, which, however, ran in a stream of deep and peaceful joy, for her heart had never known a fear or a care; she sighed, but with happiness. Presently she felt a gentle hadn introduced into her own. Starting, she turned and saw Elkington; a beau chevalier whom few female hearts as young as hers could resist— as, alas! many an unhappy maid has proved. “My charming girl,” said Elkington, “you fly me. I have looked for you everywhere, but—oh, happy moment, I find you here—and never shall you leave this spot till you hear me tell how madly I love you.” “Oh, my lord, for Heaven's sake—should any one come”—and she but lightly attempted to withdraw her hand. “Beautiful Ida, why should you hesitate? what pleasure can a heart so gentle as yours take in keeping in suspense one who adores you?” “My dear Lord Elkington, I hear a step; leave me, I entreat you, till to-morrow.” “No, Ida,” said Elkington, in a voice of sadness, which caused her to stop her attempt to release her hand, in order that she might listen; “no, sweet girl, I will hear my doom to-night. Tell me at once whether you will be mine. I must learn from your own lips whether I am happy or miserable. I fear, indeed, from your flying my presence—from your anxiety to withdraw from the hand that would defend you with life—that you despise me—that you—” “Despise! oh, my lord, how can you use so dreadful a word? Despise! oh no.” “You are, I am sure, above the coquetry of your sex, and will never trifle with the heart that loves you. Speak to me. You have tried to withdraw your hand. I resign it—I return it to you. If you are ever going to bless me with it, dearest girl, be frank on this transaction, as you are on all others; do not prolong my suspense—my suffering. Deny it to me for ever, or give it to me now.” She lifted her eyes; they met his ardent gaze. The earnestness and tenderness of his voice and manner affected her. She raised her hand and placed it in his. “I am frank, my lord—as I will be true; and if I forget the reserve proper in so young a girl, it is only that—your feelings are—dearer to me than— my own.” “Ida! beloved angel!” said Elkington. A crowd of young girls, laughing and talking, and just returning from the dance, were now heard approaching, and they burst noisily in, little dreaming how well-timed had been their coming.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. Lady Beverly and her son got into their carriage at an early hour, and Elkington ordered the coachman to drive round the Park. The night was clear without being cold, and the fresh air was pleasant after the heat and somewhat uncommon excitement of the ball. “Besides,” said Elkington, as they wheeled out of the Brandenburg gate, “I have to inform you of what may lead to a consultation, which had better be enjoyed at a proper distance from keyholes and the thin partitioned rooms of these hotels. I have had du succés to-night. The pretty bird is limed.” “You have had a conversation with Ida?” demanded Lady Beverly, with lively marks of pleasure. “She has, rather, acknowledged my superior charms,” replied Elkington, also in the highest spirits; “and I do not greatly doubt that, if I pressed the thing, it might take place any day I choose.” “Then, for the love of Heaven, Edward, let it be at once.” “I see no reason to be so alarmingly hasty,” said Elkington, “though I am not disposed myself to make any delay. She is a devilish fine girl. I haven't seen her match. You may settle matters as soon as you please with the old people. I give you carte blanche.” “I will then see the countess in the morning.” “But will you answer me one question?” asked Elkington. “Tant que vous voudrez,” said Lady Beverly. “I have observed in you a degree of anxiety respecting this partie which I can't account for. What does it mean? What particular interest have you in this young lady?” “Singular question!” said Lady Beverly. “Is it extraordinary that a mother should exhibit anxiety on the subject of her son's settlement in life?” “No, not any reasonable anxiety; but you seem, by a kind of logic, to betray the greatest anxiety precisely at the moment when I feel the least.” “What in the world do you mean?” “This, my good madame. When my amiable father, Heaven preserve his life, is in good health, and promises to last out the season, you settle down into indifference. Now it is exactly when my father promises to live long that I feel most desirous of touching a fortune of my own. But, when the old man is in one of his fits, and bids fair to pop suddenly off, you are for marrying me to money in any shape. Now I, not being at heart a marrying man, would rather keep my freedom if I came into possession of my inheritance, which, being entailed on the eldest son, must come to me whether he will or not.” “Your imagination sees things which have no existence in reality,” said Lady Beverly. “My empressement to see you settled advantageously is always equal; although, according to my mind, I may not always betray it in the same degree. Only, Edward, I want to see you married.” “Much obliged to you, madame, I'm sure, for your kind intentions; but, by Heaven, so mawkish do I consider married life, that, if this charming creature were less exquisite than she is, I would bolt even yet. It's devilish lucky for her that she's so pretty, or she would stand a slender chance of being the Countess Beverly. A wife? bah! I am a fool even now. The old man is ill; he must—d—n it, he can't last long. I come in for my £50,000 a year; I pay my debts, and then what shall I do with a wife? I shall be sick as death of her in six months, and she, very likely, will run off from me in twelve. She has too lovely a face to keep out of danger. I shall have to shoot half a dozen fellows on her account, to see her slip through my fingers at last; for women, foul and fair, are all alike at heart; and, though delicious creatures in their proper places, are sad encumbrances when tied to one by law. Partridge, always partridge.” “I am afraid, it is true, that your disposition will prevent your ever settling down into a happy husband; but I trust it will correct some of your follies. You will have no longer temptation to gamble; at least, except at home, and more moderately. Your debts once paid—” “Ah, that's the question. If it were not for them, I could leave this pretty thing to some more sentimental adorer. Marriage sickens me. It's a damper. But Shooter is getting impatient; and then— the Jew; oh! how I hate and dread that man!” “What are the amounts of these frightful liabilities? You have often promised to tell me when once in the way to discharge them. Your marriage with Ida will do that at once, and enable you, moreover, to be rich besides. What are the debts?” “Oh, as things stand, I don't mind, if you think your nerves can bear it!” “I can bear anything, if you will conclude at once your marriage with Ida. Come, frankly tell me the amount.” “Well, frankly, then, I owe Shooter £15,000.” “And the other—the usurer?” “£25,000.” “Edward, my son!” cried Lady Beverly, equally astonished and terrified. “That's it,” said Elkington, lifting his foot against the chariot cushion, and tapping it lightly with his rattan. “I told you your nerves were not strong enough.” “£25,000?” “Just, besides interest; which, by the time the old man goes, if he doesn't go pretty quick, will make it £40,000. Old Abraham is no half-way man: he is, I believe, without intending to flatter him, the most intense scoundrel that ever breathed. He's got me hooked in such a way that all earth can't help me; pay I must, and pay I shall.” “Great Heaven! I had no idea of this; and if your father should determine to—to—” “He can't, madame; and, by Heaven, I don't understand you; you have hinted this to me half a dozen times. I am my father's heir, and neither he nor any one else can help it. He won't last. He's growing worse and worse. And, notwithstanding, as usual, he goes on in the same way—living high, drinking deep; and the doctor says it must be over with him soon. With this prospect before me, what's forty, fifty, a hundred, or even more thousands. It is but living a year or two somewhere abroad, or a lucky turn at cards, and all's right again!” “Listen to me, Edward,” said Lady Beverly, in a tremulous voice. “But why do I advise you?” She caught herself, as if on the eve of making a disclosure respecting which she had changed her mind. “Go on—play deep, as you have hitherto done—heap yourself with debts—till one day you may remember your mother's caution against the wretched life of a gambler, and the danger of such equivocal characters as Shooter—when, perhaps, it may be too late to profit by it.” “It's false, madame,” said Elkington; “the gambler's life, if you honour me with that appellation, is not wretched. That is a cry raised by cowards who have not the courage to play, or by whining asses that have lost. Play is life—happiness. Nothing else gives me pleasure. I even deplore the hours lost in attendance upon this little girl, and which might be so much more delightfully employed. The life of a player who has his wits about him is one of continual pleasure. Its disappointments come unattended with pain; for what you lose to-day is, you know, only lent to be regained to-morrow. Besides, some one must eventually win, and why not I? Where so much money changes hands, it must go somewhere. It doesn't melt!” “Ah, yes it does—and most effectually!” said Lady Beverly. “I allow something for your wit, madame, but one may be facetious without being just; and as for Shooter, he's a devilish fine fellow—true as steel— and what's lost to him is fairly lost. As for Abraham—there, I acknowledge, I've been duped; but what's `without remedy should be without regard.' I'll marry the girl if the fortune is, as you assure me, large, and to be come at readily. This will quiet them all, if it does not immediately pay them. We'll go back to London, and—” They had now reached their hotel. Scarlet threw open the door. In the hall a gentleman was coming Vol. I.—E out. Lady Beverly dropped her shawl. The footman was hastening to pick it up, but it fell at the stranger's feet. He raised it, politely handed it to her, and passed on. At this moment Lady Beverly staggered back against the wall, pale, and nearly fainting. “Madame, you are ill,” said Claude—for it was he—hastening to her assistance. “No, sir—thank you—it is the—air—the ball— Scarlet—Edward—to my room—at once.” Her fine appearance and splendid ball-dress, as well as the distingué air of Elkington, and the richness of the livery of the servants, excited Claude's attention. On inquiring, he learned that he had aided Lady Beverly and Lord Elkington. They had the first floor of the hotel at which he had been to make a call. He could scarcely repress a feeling of envy, as the tall, handsome form of Elkington disappeared from his view, and he thought what a happy fate was his.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. The next morning, on coming in from a ramble, Claude found Count Carolan's card, with an invitation to dinner the next day. In the mean time he amused himself exploring the town, ranging through the immense and splendid palaces, lounging in the Park, and seeing the various curiosities interesting to travellers. Returning from a walk later in the morning of the same day on which he received Carolan's first note, he found another from him, begging him to be at home the next morning at twelve, as it would give him pleasure to accompany him in the call usually made by a stranger desirous of being introduced into society. Claude knew not whether to ascribe this attention to the representations of Madame Wharton, or to the letter of introduction from Lord Perceval. He felt that the former was cordially his friend; and he knew that the latter, well disposed towards him, had written a warm note, begging his services in favour of a valued friend. Whatever it might be ascribed to, he replied by accepting gratefully a kindness offered with so much courtesy. He had scarcely replied to it when a second note, in a pretty female hand, was brought in by Carl. He opened and read: “My dear Mr. Wyndham: “Mamma begs me to write you our address. We have taken furnished rooms at No. 70 `sous les arbres.' We are also in some difficulty with a horrid man of whom papa bought some things this morning; and mamma says, if you would call in the course of the day, she should be particularly obliged. “Yours truly, “Mary Digby.” It was about three o'clock, and Claude, who, in the pleasure of seeing the town and reflections upon his own prospects and plans, had forgotten his honest fellow-voyagers and the modest Mary, thought he could not better employ the leisure hour before dinner than in paying the desired visit immediately. Mrs. Digby, in accordance with her plan of making a dash, had taken very elegant apartments; and Claude found the new rooms in the broad and shaded street called “the Linden,” or sometimes, also, from the avenues of linden-trees which ornamented its whole length, sous les arbres. The house was in the most fashionable part of it and of the town. A servant, in a gaudy livery, waited at the door and admitted him. He could scarcely believe that he was in the domicil of the Digbys, so much had they, in the diligence, savoured of London low life. He found them in a pretty boudoir, at the end of several large and handsome rooms. They were so well dressed that he could scarcely recognise his old companions of the schnellpost. Mrs. Digby had the appearance of a very respectable old lady. Mr. Digby's toilet had also been carefully attended to, and the timid Mary looked lovelier than ever. Claude really admired her modest face, the beautiful contour of her head, her clear and tender complexion, and the Hebe-like proportions of her form. For a moment he thought her almost as pretty as the painting which had so much attracted his attention. From the appearance of the whole party, he saw at once that, with the aid of dress—if the two parents would only hold their tongues a little more, and Mary a little less—they might, with the aid of their wealth, and under the protection of the name of their “relative, the late Lord Clew,” pass through the walks of fashion for a month or two as well as others. His coming was warmly welcomed. Digby rose from a person with whom he was sitting at a little table, advanced cordially, and, after slapping him on the back with hearty familiarity, told him he was “devilish glad to see him.” Mrs. Digby was loud in her pleasure, and Mary blushed with tenfold grace, and lifted her eyes and cast them down again with a timid embarrassment rather dangerous to a susceptible youth who had never fallen in love with anything more substantial than a picture. “Well, I am devilish glad to see you, my boy,” said Digby. “Now, John, you just sit down to your lesson,” said Mrs. Digby. “We'll take care of Mr. Wyndham. You needn't think you're going to get clear on his account. Only think, sir,” continued she, turning to Claude again, “a person connected with the late Lord Clew, and not to know a word of French. He doesn't even know what turnips are. But, by-the-way, Mr. Wyndham, you haven't been introduced. This is our French master; you needn't be afraid of what you say before him; for—he don't understand a single word of English—we talk our secrets before him, poor devil! just as we would before a dumb beast; don't we, old bullfrog?” The Frenchman, who perceived that he was spoken to without knowing the meaning of the words, made two low bows, and placed his hand on his heart with an expression of grateful civility. “We have such fun,” said Mary, for the first time launching into a remark. “I call him long pockets,” said Digby. “Don't I, old beeswax?” “Infinément obligé!” cried the Frenchman, again turning to Digby with a violent bow. “This is Mr. Wyndham,” said Mrs. Digby. “Vinder?” echoed the poor man, not understanding. “I say,” cried Mrs. Digby, raising her voice almost to a scream, and putting her mouth close to his ear, as if she could make him better comprehend by speaking very loud; “I say, this is Mr. Wyndham—Mounseer Wyndham—our intimate friend— came in the diligence with us from Hamburg—because, you know, our travelling carriage was broke by that stupid John” (here she cast a look of indignation on her unhappy husband)—“so he came on with us. Do you understand that?” The man cast a look of inquiry upon her features for the sense which her words failed to convey, and then looked in the faces of the rest; but, not succeeding in getting the faintest glimpse of what she had communicated, notwithstanding she went on with greater vehemence to the last word, he shrugged his shoulders, drew up his face into a dismal look of regret and opaqueness, and said, “Ma foi, madame—comprends pas!” E 2 “Ah, the poor wretch!” said Mrs. Digby, laughing heartily. “Let him alone. Did you ever see such born fools as these foreigners are? And do you, John, go on with your lesson.” This scene afforded Claude an opportunity of observing the gentleman in question. He was a lank, weather-stained, long Frenchman, thinly clad in garments of a threadbare appearance. His trousers pockets reached nearly to his knees, and were obviously empty, except when his large hands were thrust into them, a peculiarity which had probably drawn upon him the sobriquet of “long pockets” from the humour of his interesting pupil. It is not impossible that he might have worn a shirt, but it is certain that there was no appearance of one, although, from his peculiar style of dress, the eye was easily able to penetrate a considerable way under his stock down his bony throat, and up the sleeves of his wristbands. His features were cast rather in a striking than elegant mould. His mouth was of great width; his lips so large as to have, perhaps, afforded him the cognomen to which he usually replied. His ears, like his nose, were of ample size, and stood handsomely out from his head; and his foot and hand were also of dimensions which rivalled each other. He was, in short, a very odd, but not a particularly ugly-looking person; and, for the irregularities of physiognomy already stated, fortune had favoured him with a good set of teeth; bright, intelligent eyes; a head of hair remarkable for its abundance, and the flourishing manner in which, without tongs or pomade, it curled about his head; and last, but not least, with a stock of self-approbation never exhausted and not exhaustible, flowing through all his veins, lurking in every angle and shade of his face, and creating—happy mortal!— in his interior bosom an everlasting sunshine. “Well! the poor devil can't understand us,” said Mrs. Digby, “so we can talk what we please. His name is Lippe; a pretty good one, too, isn't it, considering his mouth? You see, we expect to travel a good deal, Digby—that is, Mr. D. and I—before we settle down; for, since our relative, Lord Clew—poor dear man—has left us plenty of money, why shouldn't we have the good of it? That's my idea—and it's necessary that some one should understand French—for we do get so swindled. I don't know how it is, but there must be something about us which makes people mark us out to cheat; and yet I am sure I don't know why, for we seem formed like other people.” She went on to give a long account, from which Claude learned that this Mr. Lippe had presented himself upon somebody's recommendation, they didn't know whose, to give them a sufficient command of the French, not only to travel with less inconvenience than they had hitherto been accustomed to, but to enable them to launch with becoming grace and ease into the hitherto unexplored waters of fashionable life. Digby, to do him justice, was not ambitious of this distinction; and, although not wise, had sufficient sense to see that neither he nor his lady were exactly calculated for the sphere into which she was dragging him. In obedience to her, however—for he was too good-humoured to resist on any ordinary occasion—and from a vague idea which she had dinned into his ear, for many a day as well as night, that such a course might be advantageous to Mary, he had consented, in addition to his other experiments, to learn French. The acquisition of a new language is, alas! to any one a wearisome task. To Digby the undertaking was peculiarly unpromising. He had no memory — no ear — no ambition, and no head; the even-handed Fortune, which had sent him into the world “a relative of the late Lord Clew,” and the heir to £100,000 sterling, having withheld that article, or, at least, the brains with which it is usually (if we do not use the word in too general a sense) supplied. He hated study, having never learned anything in his life. The flattering visions of fashion, sufficient to lead his wife through any possible effort, had no place in his humbler imagination, and she half suspected that all the labour they were taking to “get into society” would be in vain. He had anticipated some pleasure from his Continental tour, but as yet he had suffered only a series of annoyances. He had been cheated, abused, and laughed at; his carriage had been broken, and once or twice he came near having his head in the same predicament; and, now that he found himself at length settled in apartments in Berlin, instead of enjoying his leisure and independence, he was set down with old “long pockets” to a lesson of three or four hours a day. It was too much; but he dared not, or, at least, did not resist; and he inwardly hoped that the period when the pleasure of travelling would begin, would come one of these days. If anything could have lightened his distress and perplexity, it would have been the peculiar style of teaching French adopted by Mr. Lippe. Like many vain men, he fancied he had a particular genius, and enjoyed profound draughts of self-praise in contemplating a new theory of teaching which he had created. This new system, exclusively his own, he lauded to the skies, and assured the innocent and inexperienced Digbys that, for one thaler a lesson, he would, in two months, make the whole family speak French, if not like natives, at least well enough for all the purposes of travelling and fashion. This wonderful new system consisted in teaching the pronunciation by imaginary lines drawn on the table with the finger. There sat poor Digby—his face red, the perspiration beginning to start from his forehead, and every now and then turning half aside to indulge in a hearty yawn, which extended his jaws almost to the dimensions of those of Lippe himself; while the latter—who was of a sanguine and frisky temperament, and who could not conceive how a man could not pronounce “pu” instead of “poo,” and “monsieur” instead of “mounsheer,” although he showed him, as plain as the nose on his face (and that was very plain indeed), the exact manner of pronouncing it, by an acute angle, drawn twenty times, one after the other, on the table—would jump up every two minutes, borne away by the enthusiasm which genius always feels in its art, thrust his hands into his trousers pockets up to the elbows, his eyes flashing fire, and then draw them out again to make new illustrative angles, circles, rhomboids, and parallelograms, on the table or in the air. “Allons,” said he, as Claude a moment lost the train of Mrs. Digby's chat, which, luckily, she did not interrupt by any questions to obscure this scene; “pour le mot `Ulysse.' Voyez vous, prononcez le de cette manière-ici” (drawing a figure on the table), “voilà! allons! commencez encore!” “Kall—lip—why that's the fellow's own name,” interrupted Digby. “Is this book about him?” “Allons! monsieur!” “Oui, munsheer, oui. Kall—lip—so, ner—poovey sir, consolleydoo—” “Du—” cried Lippe, with an acute angle. “Doo.” “Du, monsieur—” with flashing eyes—“du—du —du.” “Doo—doo—doo—do—part doo—lysse dong—” “Dans, monsieur!” screamed the choleric Frenchman, with a fiery face, and approaching him as if he were going to knock him down. “Well—d—n it—I say `dong,' ” said Digby, the sweat rolling off his forehead. “Ah! sacré diable! mais n'emporte,” he continued, recollecting himself, “tout cela viendra— allons! continuez! dans sa—” “What's John bobbing his head in here for every minute?” said Digby. “Two tradesmen's boys—with bills—and a pine-board bedstead,” said John. “Ah,” said Mrs. Digby, “it's these bills again.” The boys with their bills were admitted, and a long wrangle ensued, in which the boys demanded double charges. Mr. Lippe interpreted that the three persons were ready to swear to everything, and they wouldn't go away without being paid, which at length they were. “Well,” said Digby, “if this is what you call travelling!” Mrs. Digby was in a rage also, and Claude could not himself help feeling indignant at the fraud which had undoubtedly been practised against the English strangers—the pine-board bedstead having been sent instead of a mahogany one which they had chosen and paid for. While they were in the midst of the wrangle, Tom announced dinner. Claude was going to take leave, but the vehemence of their entreaties that he would stay and dine left him no alternative. He gave his arm, therefore, to Mrs. Digby, when, to his surprise, Mr. Lippe offered his to Mary, and led her in. “Is Mr. Lippe a member of your family?” asked he. “Oh yes. He's going to live in the house—to interpret for us—teach us French—shop with us— and do a thousand little odd jobs. I am really ashamed that he should dine at table with us in such shocking clothes—but, poor wretch!—we have sent for some new ones—and he'll be as spruce as any of us to-morrow. Poor stupid fool!” At this moment Tom appeared again at the door, and announced a lady and gentleman to look at the rooms. “Tell them to come to-morrow morning,” said Mrs. Digby. “They have already been, they say, once, and they will not come again.” “Well, they can't come in now; we are at dinner.” Tom returned immediately with— “The lady and gentleman must see the rooms!” “Must!” said Mr. Digby; “they cannot; the family are very particularly engaged; and they are also about going to dinner. They may see them at any time before three; it is now nearly four.” “Ah! bless me,” said Mrs. Digby at the window, “what an elegant carriage—two footmen—splendid liveries—coachman in cocked hat—silver lace—silk stockings. Bless my soul!—who can they be? Can they be the people who want to look at the rooms?” Tom now appeared again, in company with one of the richly-dressed footmen. “The gentleman insists upon coming in—the rooms are to let—and he must see them.” “Really, this is very singular!” said Claude. “They speak English, ma'am,” said Tom. “If he is a gentleman,” said Claude, “I will protect you from this intrusion. Who is your master?” said he to the footman. “Lord Elkington,” replied the man, respectfully. “Tell Lord Elkington that the rooms are at present occupied by ladies who are about to dine, and beg to decline any visit of this kind at so late an hour.” “His lordship has been turned away once before on the same plea,” said the man. “The doors are open, and he may come in,” said Claude, “if he pleases; but it will be without the consent, and contrary to the wishes of the family. Say so to your master.” A gentleman and lady now appeared at the head of the stairs, having been below talking to the landlady. The man delivered the message. When he had done— “Lead the way in, Scarlet,” said Lord Elkington; “I think these would do for us.” “I beg your pardon,” said he, bowing slightly to the ladies, taking off his hat, and looking around the room with his glass. “Did you deliver my message?” said Claude to the footman. “Scarlet,” said Elkington, without giving the man time to reply, “go down stairs!” He then turned his glass carelessly to the ceiling, curtains, carpets, fauteuils, and other furniture. “Ah—ah—very well—but too small, I fear.” Claude stood before him very angry, and probably showing it in his attitude and manner; but the intruder seemed to care very little for his wrath. He passed his glass an instant over his face and person, and then, as if he found nothing there worthy of a second look, he prepared to leave the room after a glance at the females, for he was one of those men who subject every woman's face to an examination. On seeing Mary he stopped, and seemed evidently struck. “I beg your pardon, my dear,” said he; “I fear there has been some mistake. I was not aware that these rooms were occupied by—by—I really beg your pardon!” “Oh, sir—my lord,” said Mrs. Digby, “you are too good. If we had had the slightest idea that it was Lord Elkington—my lord!” Elkington's eyes, during this highly amiable address, were less occupied by the courtesy of the mother than by the beauty of Mary. He regarded her with an admiration so obvious and rude as at length to cause some embarrassment on the part of the object of it, and some anger on that of Mr. Digby. “I have unfortunately, madame,” said Lord Elkington, “an appointment at this moment which prevents my explaining to you the mistake which has caused an intrusion, I fear, rather abrupt; but, with your kind permission, I will avail myself of the earliest leisure to call again and do so.” “There is not the slightest necessity,” said Mr. Digby, rather bluntly. “Oh, my lord,” said Mrs. Digby, “you are so kind; I assure you, at any time—at all times—we shall be most happy, sir—my lord, I mean—to—” During this scene Claude had stood gazing on the person thus rudely pressing into a private house, and conducting himself so singularly; and the feeling of indignation, which he could not repress, was plainly marked on his countenance. As Elkington withdrew, Claude perceived, for the first time, a female figure in the corridor. He recognised, at a glance, Lady Beverly, to whom he had rendered a slight service on the previous evening; but his attention was particularly drawn towards her attitude and the expression of her features. She was standing at her full height, the upper part of her body a little drawn back, as if she had recoiled from some object of surprise and terror. Her attitude was not unlike that of one who has just perceived a basilisk in his path, and her eyes were fixed so intently on Claude, that, as if lost in thoughts not connected with the present, she did not interrupt her gaze even when his glance met hers. She looked pale and shocked. Elkington was by this time at her side, and they hastened to the carriage. Numerous were the comments upon this incident as soon as the distinguished intruders were gone. Mr. Digby, redder even with anger than his previous exertions with the new system of Mr. Lippe had been able to make him, swore he would go instantly after him and “knock the puppy down.” “A man,” said he, stammering, “to—to—himself here into a private family, without either civility or —or—and then to conduct himself to—to—towards my daughter!” “Nonsense,” said Mrs. Digby; “you are always such a fool. I don't see any harm in his looking at Vol. I.—F Mary, or any one else; and as for rudeness, I don't think one of the first leaders of the ho-tong, as he is, could—” “Well, if this is what you call ho-tong!” said Mr. Digby. They now adjourned to dinner, where Mr. Lippe explained the French for the various dishes, qualifying himself for greater accuracy by devouring goodly quantities of the same. Mrs. Digby talked of many things which, “thank Heaven, she need not be afraid to procure, as she could afford it;” intermingling her numerous arguments upon all subjects with allusions to “her relative, the late Lord Clew.” Mr. Lippe, notwithstanding his shabby clothes and his unhappily long ears, exhibited a satisfaction and self-complacency really enviable; and as for Mary, satisfied with her loveliness, without attempting to increase it by the charms of wit or conversation, she ate and blushed in silence. The general talk was dull; neither pleasing by its lightness, nor instructive by its intellectuality. Claude was rendered almost nervous, as well by the profound conceit of Lippe, and the painful and never successful struggles of Digby to remember the principal word in every sentence he uttered. He took leave, therefore, at an early hour.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My dear Mr. Wyndham: “Mamma begs me to write you our address. We have taken furnished rooms at No. 70 `sous les arbres.' We are also in some difficulty with a horrid man of whom papa bought some things this morning; and mamma says, if you would call in the course of the day, she should be particularly obliged. “Yours truly, “Mary Digby.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. Glad to escape from a circle where he found so little attraction, Claude strolled through the streets. Almost unconsciously, his steps wandered towards the cabinet where he had seen the portrait. At the door he was surprised to find in his heart a kind of anxiety, as if he were seeking an interview with a real person, and was fearful of a disappointment. He entered, and made his way to the little room. The picture was still there. No one was present. Only a boy had greeted him as he came in, and he was busily writing in the front shop. A stream of afternoon sunshine fell through the window. The object of his attention was more striking than ever. He continued gazing with new admiration, till, whether from the fatigue of long fixed attention, or from a feeling of actual tenderness, he sighed as sincerely as if about to part for ever from a real object of affection. It was now his turn to be embarrassed, for, at a little distance, in the doorway, stood the figure of the young man whom he had met before gazing intently on this same painting. His sallow, melancholy face was shaded by a kind of stern surprise, and his eyes were fixed attentively on him. Claude recovered himself in an instant, and said, “You will perceive I am a great amateur of painting, monsieur. I have taken a fancy to this piece—it is so pretty. I should really like to buy it.” “It is not for sale, monsieur,” said the stranger, coldly. “Then you know something of it?” “Only that it is private property.” “Is it yours?” “No, monsieur!” “You are the artist, perhaps?” The young man made no reply. Modesty and poverty are so often the companions of merit, that Claude concluded at once—from his silence, his faded clothes, his face thinned by application, and the bright glances of his eyes, which seemed full of the restless fire of genius—that he was the painter. “I must really express my admiration,” said Claude, “not only of the singular charm of the countenance, but of the exquisite beauty of the production as a work of art. If it were to be bought—” “I have told you, monsieur, that it is not to be bought.” “Is it a fancy piece?” “No, monsieur. He must have a very strange imagination who could create such a face; and it is, I think, quite a sufficient triumph for any artist to imitate it.” “You will confer a favour on me, then, by telling me the name of the original.” “Why so, monsieur? She can be nothing to you?” “Very likely,” said Claude; “but—” “The person of whom this is a feeble copy,” said the stranger, “exists; but you would regard her without any of the enthusiasm which you show at the sight of her picture.” “You speak in enigmas,” said Claude, struck with a certain earnestness in the voice and manner of his companion. “She is eighty years old at present,” said the stranger; “and this is the copy of a portrait taken sixty-five years ago; but I interrupt you. Bon jour, monsieur.” “Great Heaven!” thought Claude, “how singular! Thus fade the dreams of youth, hope, and love. An old woman! hobbling with a crutch, perhaps, around a silent chamber; those tender eyes dimmed; the sweetness of that mouth gone; the pure hue of health and youth faded; infirmity— wrinkles—age! and, instead of joy, and hope, and artless affection, only the traces of faded dreams— of broken affections—of lost friends—of vanished pleasures. Oh! vanity of the world; oh! phantoms of life!” And thus all his reveries at last ended in a moral, which, being duly digested, he went to the theatre.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. The next morning, at twelve, a richly-liveried chasseur announced Count Carolan. It was the hour of the appointment, and Claude was ready to receive him. It was the first time they had met, and they seemed mutually pleased with each other. Claude's appearance was calculated to make a favourable impression on a man of ton like Carolan. Considerably above the middle height, and at once striking the attention as a handsome man, he was one of the few who to personal advantages add the charm which springs from mind and character. His form was erect and commanding, with that military air which ensures respect; and his countenance, refined and noble, conveyed an impression of a nature whose gentler attributes were governed by a high order of energy and courage. His voice was sweet and well modulated, and his manners that of one accustomed to society, and who had the repose and polish, without the frivolity and mannerism, which so often distinguish a mere homme à la mode. Count Carolan was a different sort of person. He also was a handsome man, not equal in height to the ordinary standard, with the air and appearance of a perfect gentleman, and unusually pleasing in his manners. He made himself very agreeable, asked Claude after Lord Perceval, and alluded to the favourable impression he had left upon Madame Wharton, whom he had declared to be a superior woman. In reply to some inquiries after her, he said, “She has been in a higher position in life, but, I fear, not in a happier; and we have, from delicacy, always abstained from asking details of circumstances which she appears anxious to banish altogather F 2 from her mind. She is contented with us, and she has been of inestimable service to my daughter. By-the-way, I hope you will not forget us to-day at four.” The count's carriage was at the door, and they proceeded to their calls without farther delay. It was three o'clock before the count dropped him again at his hotel. They had seen many, and left cards on many more distinguished persons. He was still more favourably impressed with his new friend after this interview, and a sincere regard appeared to have sprung up between them; a slight pomposity of manner, which would scarcely attract his attention if he had not heard it alluded to, occasionally jarred upon the pleasures of the ride; but Claude amiably reasoned that every man had his foibles, and it was wise to shut one's eyes to all but the good in those with whom we associate. At four o'clock he was at the door of Carolan's splendid palace, the exterior of which he had already so much admired. A file of carriages, the servants in full livery, were driving up and off again, having set down their company upon a carpet which extended into the street. A crowd was gathered about the door to see them alight. He passed into the broad and lofty hall, with large vases and graceful statues rising around, and crowded with rows of handsome men, glittering in liveries of velvet and gold. Ascending the low flight of richly-carpeted steps, and passing through an antechamber and several other ample and magnificently furnished rooms, of which the air was full of incense, and still between files of domestics, stationed at short intervals from each other, he at length reached that one where such of the guests as were already arrived awaited the coming of the rest. Count Carolan received him at the door in the most gracious manner, and, after shaking him heartily by the hand, led him forward, and presented him to the countess: a very fine-looking woman of five-and-forty, whose unobtrusive dress and affable manners pleased him at once. She made the usual inquiries, and was evidently struck with his distinguished appearance. He had time, however, to extend to her but a few brief remarks, when Carolan, taking him again by the arm, brought him to Madame Wharton, whose face lighted with pleasure at the sight of him. With a single shake of the hand, and a greeting on either side more than friendly, he was led on and presented to several other distinguished persons, on whom he had called in the morning. “But where is my daughter—where's Ida?” said Carolan. “Oh—I see—let me beg you—my dear —Mr. Wyndham.” Claude turned and bowed, scarcely seeing to whom, for the girlish figure to whom these words were addressed was facing a lady who occupied a seat by her on a divan. She lifted her eyes with a slight salutation, and Claude was about to address her with some commonplace remark, when, with great surprise, he perceived the image of the portrait, perfect as if reflected in a mirror, except that the smile, as it came and passed away—the eyes, as they were raised and lowered again modestly, beneath his unguarded look of astonishment, brought to it new beauties—the charm of motion—the loveliness which the rising colour and the low sweet voice alone can give. It was not till Count Carolan had twice repeated “Mr. Wyndham,” in the act of presenting him to Lady Beverly, and uttered the word “Lord Elkington,” that he recovered from his surprise to perceive the form of Lady Beverly drawn up coldly to his half unconscious greeting; and to behold Elkington gazing at him through his glass, and returning his bow with a reserve which, little regarded at the time, was subsequently recalled to memory. At this moment a servant announced dinner. The ladies, escorted by those whose rank entitled them to the honour, led the way into the dining-room. Elkington gave his arm to the young Countess Ida. Madame Wharton was among the last. No one seemed disposed to conduct her. She was, for a moment, slightly embarrassed. Claude hastened to her side, and in a few moments they were seated next each other at table. The dinner-service corresponded with the other marks of the munificent host's wealth. A royal table could scarcely be more superbly laid with gold and silver, in striking forms and of rich workmanship. All this was rendered more splendid by the size and magnificence of the hall and its furniture, the exquisite master-pieces of paintings which adorned the walls, the rich ceilings and inlaid floor. The Countess Ida sat opposite Claude, a little on his left, and Madame Carolan on his right. The conversation, instead of being general, divided itself into little coteries, with as much freedom as if each were at a table of his own. Claude glanced at the young girl whose appearance had so much surprised him. She was talking with Elkington. He could not hear what they said, but the tones of a sweet voice reached him. He looked at her with perfect impunity, for she never turned her eyes towards him, and was obviously unconscious of his presence, as of his existence. He watched her features to behold if the faultless perfection, which rendered them so lovely in repose, disappeared when she spoke or laughed. But no; the charm which the artist had seized was but a small part of that with which Heaven had invested her. There was as much to bewilder in the tone of her voice as in the expression of her eyes. There was as much danger in her motion as in the outline of her face and form. Who could the stranger be who had so impudently misinformed him? What was his reason? His eye passed from her form and countenance to that of her companion, Lord Elkington. There was something in him which displeased him, he scarce knew why. He was aroused by Madame Wharton, who, in a tone full of playful kindness, uttered the word “Well!” He started as if detected in some culpable action. “Upon my word,” said she, laughing, “you are caught at last.” “Indeed, madame,” said Claude, stammering in spite of himself. “Oh, monsieur — no apologies — no excuses. Ought I not to say now, in my capacity of Mentor, Are these the thoughts, oh Telemachus, which should occupy the mind of the son of Ulysses? Does it become you to yield at the first sight of the enemy? you, who were so confident when no danger was near?” “I acknowledge, oh Mentor,” replied Claude, laughing, “the justice of your reproof. It but shows, by another example, how rash is youth in daring danger, and how weak in overcoming it.” “But, without jesting, how do you like my favourite. Have I over-described her?” “With your supernatural penetration,” said Claude, “you would not believe me if I denied that she greatly surpasses my expectations. But I am already acquainted with her countenance.” “You have seen the portrait, taken by the Professor —. It is to appear at the exhibition.” “And the gentleman is your famous Lord Elkington?” “It is. How do you like him?” Claude hesitated. “Remember, you are my pupil,” continued she. “I must have no secrets.” “If I dared to form or express an opinion on such slight grounds,” said Claude, “and in so short a time.” “You may express any opinion to me,” said Madame Wharton; “I assure you I shall be discreet.” “Well, then, I don't like him!” “It is curious,” said Madame Wharton, “but he makes the same impression upon me. At first I liked him much. But, the more I see him, the more this favourable impression wears off.” “Shall I not be taking too great a liberty in asking whether she is actually affianced?” “It is so nearly settled that I regard it as irrevocable. The count is very anxious. Madame de Carolan is always submissive to her husband's wishes, and Lady Beverly is singularly interested.” “But the young lady herself?” “Young ladies, in this part of the world, have not much to say on these subjects. She would as soon think of disobeying her parents in any other affair of life as in this. She has been brought up so. She considers it her duty, and I believe she would sacrifice anything to that.” “This will be a sacrifice, then?” “Oh no, I do not say that; on the contrary, she is evidently attached to Lord Elkington!” If Claude had not before perceived that he was considerably interested in the questions he was putting, the disappointment which came over him, as he received this annunciation, would have convinced him. He turned his eyes upon her again. She was still talking with Elkington. He had just said something, apparently, which surprised and pleased her; and she had drawn a little back, and was looking in his face with an expression of earnest delight and animation. There was in her countenance a certain expression of confiding familiarity. He withdrew his glance, determined to look no more. He occupied himself the rest of the hour with Madame Wharton, who gave him much information respecting the principal persons at table; among whom were many of the foreign ministers, some celebrated travellers, the most fashionable women of the societé, and two or three individuals who had a European reputation, and whose names were destined to be familiar to posterity. The dinner was over in a short time. The gentlemen rose with the ladies, and all adjourned once more to the drawing-room, where coffee, &amp;c., were taken, during a conversation more social and gay than that which had preceded the dinner. Claude spoke again with Carolan, and with several others who recognised him, or to whom he was presented. Among them were several dashing young men. He remarked particularly Count de Lavalle, Lord Beaufort, and a Mr. Thomson. They were extremely polite, particularly the latter, who begged to be presented to him. He offered, in a very pressing manner, all kinds of services and counsel, and asked to be permitted the pleasure of calling on him at his hotel. Lord Beaufort, after the usual greeting, merely remarked that it was “devilish stupid;” that “the people seemed all dying of ennui;” that he thought “the dinner would last an eternity.” Lavalle informed Claude that a fine opera was to be given at six, which would be attended by “everybody.” Two or three ambassadors, and other leaders of the ton, told him they should be most happy to see him at their houses on certain evenings of the week; and both Madame and Monsieur Carolan were particular in making him promise to come the next evening at nine to their ball and supper, of which they gave one a week through the winter. While he was talking with Countess Carolan, the latter called Ida to say something to her which demanded a reply, and led to a kind of dispute. Claude was appealed to. A feeling, not unnatural in one of his character, but very ridiculous, threw over him a kind of reserve—a hauteur—when he found himself compelled to address her. As if she supposed this either his natural manner, or perhaps timidity, with a sweetness of nature which touched him with compunction even while he replied, she added a few words, which he answered with a distant politeness so different from his air while conversing with others, that the young girl observed it. A colour rose to her cheek, and, as two persons who felt that there was no congeniality between them, and almost a dislike, they parted. A few moments afterward, while he was laughing and talking very gayly with a lovely woman, he saw Ida sitting alone; then Elkington approached her, her face lighted up, and he felt that this handsome young lord possessed her affection.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. From the Carolans, Claude went to the opera. The house was already full; and he was surprised to see the large proportion of officers, whose glittering uniforms, combined with the elegant toilets of the ladies, and the ample box in front, furnished with chairs, and decorated with particular splendour for the members and guests of the royal family, added greatly to the effect of the scene. Presently the royal box was filled with princes and princesses, with their maréchals, chambellans, grande-maitresses, and dames d'honneur, forming a circle extremely imposing. It was, indeed, the whole Prussian court, surrounded by the corps diplomatique and the principal nobility of the town. Claude had scarcely taken the seat which the box-keeper procured for him, when a familiar “Bon soir, Wyndham,” behind him, and a hand laid gently on his shoulder, attracted his attention to Lord Beaufort. “How are you?” said he. “You don't mean to stay here through the whole piece, I hope?” “Certainly,” said Claude; “I came for that purpose.” “You'll be suffocated,” said he. “I would not remain through one act for a much better opera.” “Indeed?” “They murder music here. It's shocking, positively.” “Why, I understood,” said Claude, disappointed, “that I should hear some excellent music.” “Nothing can be more horrid; however, it's better than one of Carolan's dinners. Such bores. I really—can't endure them. Can you?” “On the contrary,” said Claude, “I—” “Ah! I see—you're a stranger. They're very well at first, but, after once or twice, they're épouvantables! Carolan's such a pompous ass. It puts me in mind of a phrase of Voltaire's: `I can never talk with his excellency without wishing to horse-whip him!' ” “Oh, you are severe.” “No, upon my honour; and then their exertions to marry that girl of theirs. It's disgusting—positively.” “Are you speaking of the young Countess Ida?” “Yes; didn't you see all dinnertime? She's as bad as they. A rich English lord, who is to be an earl, is rather a fat fish in the net of a Prussian count.” “You don't mean to suspect that lovely girl of fishing for Lord Elkington?” said Claude, with surprise. “I know she does,” said Beaufort, coolly. “They're all mad after him. She's got him, too, they say. Though he's a complete puppy—entre nous—and as great a—Ah, how are you, Elkington?” The door had opened at the moment, and the Carolans, with Elkington and Lady Beverly, came in. He had scarcely exchanged salutations when Lavalle and Thomson entered also. Vol. I.—G “Well, here comes that fool Thomson,” whispered Beaufort. “I am off; he's a little too polite for me. Adieu!” and he took his leave for another box. Lavalle saluted Claude warmly. They already seemed, by a kind of presentiment, to mark each other out for friends. Thomson, who had taken a profound liking to Claude, made a profusion of bows, shaking him most affectionately by the hand; begged him to take another place nearer the stage, which, he assured him, he would find more convenient; asked if he had a bill, and, on finding that he had not, resigned his own, insisting upon his keeping it, as he perfectly well knew the piece, and had not the slightest occasion for it. He even offered to hold his hat, but this Claude objected to; and, although his very amiable companion protested that he “really liked to hold hats at an opera—it was an occupation for him—it gave him something to do,” Claude begged to be allowed to retain his himself. The house was now full and quietly seated. The curtain had risen, and the opera was proceeding, when, at a moment when there was an interval of comparative silence, as well among the audience as on the scene, the box door was opened, and a considerable bustle and rustle announced the entrance of new-comers. They proved to be the Digbys. Madame was en grand toilet, and Digby was so much over-dressed as to attract towards both a general attention. They made also a good deal of noise. The notice thus drawn upon them was not the less continued from the appearance of Mary. She had the taste to dress becomingly; and her very beautiful face and form, exhibiting all the fulness of youth and health, never appeared to more striking advantage. It seemed that every eye and glass in the house were turned towards them, and they excited, indeed, such obvious remark—Digby and his honest dame by their conspicuous dress and the noise they made, and Mary by the loveliness of a face not seen before in the Berlin circles—that admiration by the gentlemen, comments by the ladies, and inquiries by both were quite audible, and the Carolans turned to see who it was. At this moment, with the eyes of the whole house upon them, and almost in a position as public as that of the actors on the stage, the Digbys recognised Claude, and nothing would answer but a general and hearty shaking of hands, and divers exclamations of delight and surprise. Mrs. Digby thought, like many of her betters, that notoriety was distinction, and that the more she could be conspicuous the better effect she should have upon this her début in the fashionable world. As Claude and Mary stood together a moment, while the party were arranging themselves in their seats, various whispers flew through the house that they were a rich and noble English family; that they were intimate relatives of “Lord Clew;” that “la jeune Anglaise” was about to marry Monsieur de Wyndham, who had come with them to Berlin, that the ceremony might be performed and the honeymoon spent in this gay metropolis. Some said Mr. Digby was Lord Clew himself. Mrs. Digby was completely inflated and off her balance with the delight of being, with her darling and lovely daughter, the object of such general and respectful attention. Claude saw Ida look at Mary with evident admiration as the latter seated herself beside him, and lifted her eyes with her usual blush to his face. There was no reason why he should care what opinion the young countess might form of him or of his affairs, and yet he was a little embarrassed that she should see him so apparently familiar with a person who, however pretty, was, after all, a sad simpleton. Elkington also, at the same time, turned, and, as their eyes met, Claude bowed. Elkington eyed him coolly through his glass, but did not make any reply. What rendered this more unpleasant was, that Ida saw it, and obviously with surprise. There is in nature no particular indignity in bowing one's head to a person who does not choose to bow in return, but there are few things more likely to arouse one's indignation. This, with several other circumstances, awakened his observation respecting both Lord Elkington and his mother, of whom the latter had several times regarded him with a fixed attention, much more marked than anything in their relative position rendered natural. He resolved to avail himself of the very earliest opportunity to ascertain, for his satisfaction at least, whether the slight put upon him by Elkington was intended or accidental. Elkington, as if conscious of his thought, turned that instant, and Ida also. Claude leaned forward, and said, “Good evening, Lord Elkington.” The young man resumed his original position with such perfect coolness, that even yet, for a moment, it was scarcely possible to believe his conduct intentional. “My dear Mr. Wyndham,” said Mrs. Digby, in a voice too loud not to excite attention, “I can never —do you know—remember the name of the thing they look through—the spyglass. I always call mine the spyglass.” “The opera-glass, you mean.” “Yes — the spyglass — or the opera-glass — in English it's all the same thing, you know; but I mean the French name.” “Lorgnette,” said Claude. “Milles remercimengs!” said Madame Digby, with an affectation which Claude had never seen in her before. “Do you know we've left ours chez nous. That John of mine, as usual, forgot it.” “Well—if she will be eternally giving me things to—to—my pocket,” said Digby. “John,” said Madame Digby, with a look of intense reproof; “pray, Mr. Wyndham, have you one?” “No,” said Claude, anxious to stop this interesting conversation by whispered and monosyllabic replies. “Couldn't you borrow one? for I am positively lost without it.” “No,” said Claude. “She bought it to-day—and never had one before in her life,” whispered Mr. Digby, with a wry face, aside to Claude. “Do you speak English, mounseer?” said Mrs. Digby to an old gentleman behind her, with a red face and white hair, and a riband in his button-hole. The old gentleman replied only by pursing up his mouth and brows into a piteous expression of futile politeness, and shrugging his shoulders to intimate that he could not understand her. “Do you, mounseer?” demanded Mrs. Digby of another. The last said some words which were entirely unintelligible to her, but, bowing with great affability, handed her a bill. “Did you ever see such a set of born fools?” said Madame Digby. Claude cast his eyes towards Mary. She was in the full crisis of a blush, and he smiled and leaned over her to speak. From her awkward habit of blushing, it was rather a dangerous matter to speak to her in the presence of others without letting them hear what was said, for it might be supposed, from her manner of receiving the most indifferent remark, that she was in the act of yielding to a red-hot declaration of love. By one of those chances which lovers complain of, Ida turned again at this moment to speak to her father, who sat behind her, and she saw the head of Claude bent over towards Mary's, and the heightened colour of the silly girl could not have been unnoticed. It seemed, however, as if she G 2 desired to exonerate herself from any participation in the rudeness of Elkington, for she slightly bent her head and smiled. There was kindness, there was almost confidence in her expression. Their eyes met, and Claude, with a sense of relief, was satisfied that she was not only astonished, but displeased at the rudeness of her companion. His look of pleasure was so true and lively that it seemed to surprise her. Claude looked at Elkington. He could just perceive his features, and that there was a cloud upon his brow. A sense of pleasure kindled a moment in his heart, but died away as he remembered that he was indulging in a very unusual admiration for one who, in fact, was all but the wife of another. “Why, who on airth is that?” said Madame Digby. It was not in Claude's nature to do an unamiable act, and he told her. The good dame was in such a flutter of enjoyment, and so unconscious of doing anything wrong, and she seemed to count with so much confidence on his services, that, however annoyed by her loud talk and fidgety manner, he did not wish to offend her. “What, are they the ones we talked about in the stage-coach?” “Yes.” “Why, you don't say so!—dear me!—bless my soul!” Here she whispered John, who whispered Mary; and then Mrs. Digby, fearful that Mary might not hear, leaned over a little old gentleman's lap behind her, and whispered Mary herself, and the word “Carolan” was heard rather audibly repeated several times. This must have been particularly edifying to the count, who sat on the second seat and heard it all, without being himself recognised by the lady who was so anxiously scrutinizing the female members of his family. “Well! I don't really think she is so very pretty,” said Mrs. Digby. “She ain't to be compared to our Mary!” “If her nose was a little longer,” said Digby. “And as for the countess—that big woman's the countess, I suppose—ain't she, Mr. Wyndham? And who's the tall one with long curls? Don't you know her? Why—no—yes—no—it is—as sure as you live,” continued Mrs. Digby, “there's Lord Elkington.” “D—n him—so he is!” said Digby. “Well, I wonder he doesn't see Mary,” said Mrs. Digby. Here Mr. Digby half hummed over the air which the singer was giving from the stage. It happened to be a favourite one; and the noise in the box occasioned a call for order and silence, accompanied by one or two hisses from the pit; and the old gentleman, upon whose lap Mrs. Digby had just rested, and who had for some time leaned aside, with his open hand to his ear by way of a trumpet, at once to receive the sound of the music and to exclude that of the conversation, which had thrown him into a high state of angry excitement, turned upon Mr. Digby with a glance so furious that he stopped humming instantly, to listen to a harangue about thirty seconds in duration, accompanied by corresponding gestures, in the German language. “Oh—certainly—by all means—mounseer!” said Digby. “If that is really your opinion, I myself think differently.” And here Mrs. Digby and Mary fell into a fit of laughing, which they could not at once repress. Matters here rested for half an hour; but Claude was next annoyed by Mrs. Digby's requesting to be presented to the Countess Ida. “I want to see if she's as pretty close as she is far off. I don't believe a word of it.” Claude assured her that it was out of the question to present people at the opera. And, with the view of getting rid of her, he lifted the seat in front of him, which by some accident had remained unoccupied, and took the place. Although not in the same box, this brought him by the side of Ida. A slight salutation passed again between them. He then carelessly cast his eyes over the surface of heads in the pit. Every face there was turned towards the scene with one exception. A young man in the centre fixed his eyes on the box. He recognised his face immediately. It was the poor and eccentric artist who had misinformed him respecting the portrait of Ida. At first he thought he was looking towards himself; but, finding that he did not withdraw his eyes when he returned it, he saw that Ida was the object of his attention, and that his glance was riveted upon her. “Will you permit me to ask if you know the young person in the pit whose face is turned towards you?” said Claude. Ida looked in the direction indicated, and perceived him at once. “Certainly—very well,” she replied, after saluting affably the young stranger. “He is a poor artist, I believe,” said Claude, “and has painted a charming portrait of you; but I have not heard his name.” “An artist—he?” said Ida. “He paint my picture? Not he—poor fellow! He is a teacher of languages—Mons. Rossí.” “Indeed!” said Claude. “He has given me lessons in Italian for some time, and continues still to do so. Papa pities him; he is very poor; and he is, besides, so punctual, so attentive, and takes such pains to please—” As Claude looked on Ida, he conceived a suspicion of the secret of this poor fellow's misery; his gazing on the portrait—his refusal to name her— his sigh—and his fixed attention to her during the present evening. While he pitied, he could not blame him. He felt that, were he himself called to her side an hour every day, he might be as audacious and as wild; and once more a cold reserve came over his manner, and his abrupt transition seemed to surprise and embarrass her. “Do you speak English, mem?” said Madame Digby, leaning over and addressing Ida. “A little!” was the modest and polite reply. “Well, mem, thank God! and so do I; and I'm really glad, mem, to hear my own language so well spoke in foreign parts.” Ida slightly bowed, with a smile. “Not but that I speak French, mem, also—un poo, but I prefer the English infinitely, as any other person of sense must. It's so much—so — so— much—easier, mem.” Ida looked at Claude as if for some explanation, having already seen him on terms of such apparent intimacy. That young gentleman's amiability was ebbing fast. He began to wish he had cut the Digbys long ago, and he felt as if the earth's opening and swallowing him at once would be a fate altogether too delightful. “Will you be so good as to lend me your spyglass?” said Mrs. Digby. “Thank you, mem; it's so very far from here to the stage, that one does not know whether the actors are there or not.” After a considerable turning and twisting with the “spyglass,” pulling it quite out and shutting it quite in, and several “dear me's” and “bless my souls,” Mrs. Digby handed it back with, “Thank you, mem!” And then, from the quiet manner of Ida, suspecting that she had not made a favourable impression, she added, “I hope, mem, you'll not think me for'erd in opening the conversation. I should not have presumed to do so, only our very intimate friend, Mr. Wyndham, has spoken so much of you, that I really feel as if we were old acquaintances. I hope there's no harm done, mem?” “Not in the least,” said Ida. “Well, mem, that's right. I was sure there wasn't.” Elkington, who had been looking and listening during this conversation, here whispered the Countess Carolan, and then to his mother, who sat next to Ida. Lady Beverly also whispered Ida, and rose. Claude heard Ida's voice: “No, I assure you, not in the least!” and then Lady Beverly: “Yes, my dear, your mother wishes it.” Ida accordingly rose and changed places with Lady Beverly, while Elkington took that just occupied by Ida. This brought him next to Claude, but he turned his shoulder towards him as he looked upon the scene, and did not alter his position during the evening. “I hope, mem,” commenced Mrs. Digby, about to address a remark across Elkington's shoulder to Lady Beverly; but that lady, with a start, and a countenance of surprise and anger, regarded the honest dame a moment in a way which effectually discouraged her from farther proceedings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. When the opera was over, Claude was met in the lobby by Lavalle and Beaufort. The Carolan party came out, and the countess stopped to speak with him. “I have been requested to bring you this evening with us to Madame de B—'s. Will you go? Come to us, then, in half an hour. She is the lady of the — ambassador, and she will expect you. Adieu! I shall see you presently.” Carolan then came out, and also said a few words to Claude. “You are to go with madame this evening to Madame de B—'s. I am engaged; you will be her chevalier.” “I am too happy to be at her orders,” said Claude. The footman now came up with the cloaks, and announced the carriage. Ida's “good-night” to Claude in his own language sounded like music. “Dieu! est elle belle?” said Lavalle, kissing the ends of his gloved fingers, and turning up his eyes in a sort of half affected rapture. “She's well enough,” said Beaufort, “but her face is silly. It wants expression.” “Good-evening, mem!” said Mrs. Digby, as she caught the eye of Ida; and then, brushing by Lady Beverly, she followed the footman to her carriage, while Digby, with Mary, came after. The Carolans had gone on, and were out of sight as Elkington came out of the box so as to meet Mary. He stopped her. “I hope you are well this evening, and that you will permit me to call and make my excuses to you for the apparent rudeness of which I was guilty the other day?” “Oh yes — always — certainly—my lord,” said Mary, with a deep blush. “Indeed, I shall take the liberty very soon,” said he; and with a look of admiration, and without looking at Claude, he gave his arm to his mother and passed on. The young men accompanied Claude a part of the way to his hotel, and made various comments, with much zest, upon persons, male and female, of the society whose acquaintance he had not yet formed. Monsieur de This, Mademoiselle de That, and Madame de the Other, were here arraigned with very little ceremony, and were occasionally dismissed with a lively or facetious estimate, probably far short of their respective opinions of themselves. The invitation which Claude had received from Madame de Carolan was given and accepted in a minute, and he scarcely understood its import. Was he to escort that lady to Madame de B—'s? and was Ida to be of the party? The necessary alterations in his toilet were soon made. In less than half an hour he was at Carolan's. Ida and her father were in the drawing-room. “You come in time,” said the count, “for I must go;” and he left them almost immediately. Claude found himself alone with the person with whom, in spite of his general good sense and his sober principle of right, he was, each hour, each moment, becoming more fascinated. A short conversation ensued. Claude was reserved and distant. He was determined to give no token of the power which this young girl already began to exercise over him. His courtesy, while it was all that a gentleman could bestow, made her think his character haughty and his heart cold. Their short interview was presently interrupted by the entrance of Madame Wharton, and then of the countess, and the carriage was announced at the same moment. On their way to Madame de B—'s a lively conversation was carried on between the countess and himself. Ida remained silent. It was the first time she had ever found herself almost proudly repulsed, and her glance, so much valued, so gratefully acknowledged by all she had met before, not only unsought, but apparently undesired. A feeling of dislike arose in her heart, but it was mingled with pique and curiosity. With all her advantages of person and character, she had a modest opinion of herself; and it could not enter into her inexperienced mind that the young stranger, who almost rudely withdrew from her careless affability, was more capable of appreciating her and more ready to admire, than any one she had met before, and that it was a consciousness of her power and his own danger which repelled a man of honour from her side. Once, as a lamp cast its light upon her face through the carriage window, Claude fixed his eyes upon it, himself in the shadow. It was thoughtful as of one alone, and as touched with perfect beauty as a head by Guido. A sentiment of admiration, of love, entered his breast. He felt himself in the presence of one formed to impress and sway him with a word or look, and yet so far beyond his reach that it was a crime to think of her. There was something in this hopeless passion—thus full-born within him in an instant, as if by inspiration—for a being so exalted, so lovely, so guarded by all the haughty distinctions of rank and wealth—which suited his romantic and melancholy nature, his passionate and high imagination. His course through the world had been alone. It had been like a wanderer in a bark over a dark sea, without companion by his side or light above; and this young girl broke upon him like a star, whose loved beams, however distant, however cold, might cheer his gloom and guide him on his solitary track. The spell was thrown over him in that careless moment. He yielded that kind of tender and unqualified worship which is one of the charms of youth, genius, and purity of character. At the Countess de B—'s he found all the society assembled. The affable hosts received him with pleasure. The half dozen saloons and ballroom were thronged. He recognised, in a distant corner of the room, Lady Beverly seated, with her glass to her eye, and peering at him through the crowd with an earnest watchfulness of his motions, which again surprised him. Presently Lavalle addressed him. “You don't dance?” “Oh yes!” Vol. I.—H “Let me make you acquainted with Mademoiselle de Vigne.” The young lady was very pretty and lovely, and spoke English perfectly well. She had dark hair and eyes, and appeared enjoying a state of health and spirits which had never been disturbed by a care. “You are very much lié with the Carolans,” said she, as they paused in the dance. “I like them much.” “And what an angel Ida is!” “Do you think her pretty?” “Oh! I think her the most perfect creature in the whole world; do not you?” “She is certainly pretty,” said Claude, smiling at her enthusiasm. “Oh, I am sure. Such a heavenly countenance —such an angelic figure—such a beautiful manner —and then, oh Dieu! she draws and plays—and sings and dances—all the gentlemen are in love with her. They say a great many have broken their hearts for her.” “Yes?” “Oh yes. Her father is an excellent person—but, oh Dieu! so proud. But she has made a superb partie, and she is so happy—everybody adores her!” “Lord Elkington, then, is certainly going to marry her?” “Oh dear, yes.” “And is she attached to Lord Elkington?” “Oh, certainly. How can she help it? Do you not think him very handsome?” “Rather so.” “And such a delightful person—so amiable—so lovely and clever—such a good-hearted man—what a beautiful and happy couple they will make! I assure you, they are the talk and admiration of everybody; and then Lady Beverly—such a charming woman!” Claude could not but compare the artlessness of this pretty child—who had known nothing of life but its joys, and who was just emerging from the shelters of her home into a world which she expected to find for ever all sunshine and flowers—with Beaufort, who piqued himself upon being blasé. “Are you acquainted with Madame Wharton?” asked she, after finishing another turn in the dance. “Oh yes. She is a very great favourite of mine.” “Everybody thinks her such an estimable woman. She has brought Ida up so admirably—but do you know,” she added, mysteriously, “that no one can tell anything of her earlier history!” “Indeed!” “She was an English lady, they say—very rich —but no one knows the least about her affairs. They do say that—” But here the fair narrator was obliged to resume her dancing; and then the contre-dance was finished; and then a tall, blooming-faced young officer, with his clothes made very tight, so as to exhibit a slender and elegant form to the utmost advantage, came up in great haste, and claimed her hand for the next dance, and Claude did not get near her again during the evening, though he often saw her light and girlish figure whirling in the waltz, in all the unclouded enjoyment of innocence and youth. Whenever Lavalle met him, he took occasion to enter into conversation with him. He liked him more and more, and discovered in him a mind superior to the general order of more fashionable men. Thomson annoyed him by a constant series of civilities, which he could scarcely withdraw from, as they seemed to be the result of an ever obliging disposition. His principal pleasure, however, appeared to be to talk of, or form a party at whist, as this seemed to be the engrossing subject of his reflection, and the principal enjoyment of his life. In the course of the evening, Claude passed Elkington several times without any sign of mutual recognition. With Lady Beverly it was the same. She was always stately and cold, and appeared to overlook him, although more than once, when she did not think herself observed, she regarded him with a scrutiny for which he could not account. At twelve the supper was over and the company began to disperse. Claude found his ever faithful Carl in the hall with his cloak, and was about returning to his hotel, when Thomson insisted that he should join Lavalle, Beaufort, and two or three others at his rooms for a rubber of whist. Lavalle urged his compliance. He found that Thomson, who was an Englishman of respectable family, lived with considerable style. A circle of young men of independent fortune met there. Several were elegant and highly cultivated persons, destined subsequently to take their stand in the world, and perhaps in history; while many were merely the careless characters of a day, who pass their lives without trouble or reflection, in a narrow circle of amusements, taking little care to cultivate understandings which they might have rendered useful to their country. To him, however, they were all alike affable, and he passed several gay hours at the whist-table. They chatted, smoked, supped, and played, and it was near three when Claude found himself in the street alone on his return home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. It was a pleasant night. The air was still and clear without being cold, and very refreshing and agreeable. The moon was in the wane, and had just risen, casting a singular radiance over the earth and heaven. Having supped heartily, and, with several new and interesting topics of reflection, being too fully awake to think of sleep, he determined to prolong his stroll around the town. The streets were silent and lonely. Here and there the night-watch went slowly by, with his long, shrill whistle, as if ingeniously contrived to disturb the sick, to awaken the sleeping, and to do service to none except thieves and robbers, who, thus warned, get to their hiding-places till he is out of the way. Before the palaces of princes and military officers of high standing, and the public edifices, the guards paced slowly to and fro, in their simple gray cloaks and leathern caps, their muskets glittering in the moonbeams; and once during his ramble he was crossed by a company of fifteen or twenty soldiers, on their rounds to relieve guard, their measured tramp echoing on the pavement, and reminding him that he was in the metropolis of one of the greatest military governments of Europe. Claude went on, now indulging in his own reveries, now watching the broad, level streets, so beautiful in the moonlight, and the sculptured palaces, with their shadowy courts and half-unearthly company of statues; now listening to the whistle of the watch, as it retreated and died away in the distance. At length he found himself before the Brandenburg gate, and paused to admire the tall columns, the stately outline, and the bronze group upon the top. The guard at the gate made no question as he passed out to extend a ramble so delightful into the wood. It was the hour for calm thought, and he had many subjects of reflection. The principal one was the young girl with whom he had become acquainted in so curious a manner, and who seemed the imbodying of his fairest visions of woman. He had been struck with her character as described by Madame Wharton—an authority the best that could exist on such a subject. That of a mother would have been partial; that of a friend might have been H 2 drawn from imperfect sources. His own experience he could have placed but little confidence in, for he knew how different a thing woman often is in her real mind from what she appears when invested with the charm of beauty and seen in the walks of pleasure. It is probable that, without the previous eulogies of Madame Wharton, the grace and loveliness of Ida would not have succeeded in impressing him so seriously. Every one will not sympathize with a young man who cannot fall in love till assured by better authority than his own observations of the merit of the object. But this was Claude's character; imbued with thought, his feelings, or at least his actions, were subservient to his reason. His lonely life had rendered contemplation almost too habitual to him. He had dwelt too long and too much on the valuelessness of the earthly objects so ardently sought by his fellow-creatures. For, after all, the everlasting homilies on the evanescence of existence, while they rarely arrest the thoughtless in their pursuit of pleasure or the wicked in their career of guilt, often render the contemplative unnecessarily sad, and deprive the unhappy of sources of distraction from solemn realities which a benevolent Providence did not intend should appal or overshadow us. To Claude most of the objects of life were phantoms—most of its joys illusions. He wanted the development of his affections to balance and perfect his character, and to counteract the results of a too exclusive development of his intellectual faculties. He had lived in a world of thought. He wanted to descend into the warmer one of feeling. His mind had occupied itself with subjects vast, high, and eternal. He had not studied society and common life with sufficient attention. Such a mind may be great if occasion presents, but cannot be contented in the world where we are destined to live. Some author observes with a true philosophy, “Bad as men may be, Providence intends that we shall love them.” The uncompromising energy of Claude's character, and the independence of an original thinker, made the path of youth one of danger, and caused him, in many things, to stand aloof from other men. As he wandered on, Elkington, his singular insolence—Lady Beverly, her unaccountable curiosity, which seemed to watch his actions and search into his soul—recurred to his memory. The former he resolved to avoid if possible, and he determined never to deviate from the cold courtesy which should avert a quarrel. The anger with which he had received his rudeness passed away under the fields of heaven. He reflected that it was not in the power of such a man to insult him. He paused at these thoughts and gazed upward. The air was strangely clear; for nature, as if seeking higher praise than man's, seems to put on more wonderful beauty when his eye no longer gazes on it. An indescribable peace and lustre reigned everywhere: upon the piles of motionless and silver clouds, the steady-beaming planets, and the far off, ever-burning groups of stars. He gazed long and intently with a fervid wonder. There flowed the Milky Way, rolling its snowy and noiseless waves through the track of blue. He gazed almost breathless into its eternal depths. There was Orion, mounting heavenward with his glittering belt; and there—at rest amid this revolving multitude—the point on which seemed to hang all this infinite sphere of worlds—half seen, and undistinguished by the common eye—the wanderer's guide—the lover's hope—the type, in its constancy, of how few hearts!—lay the polar star. As he lost himself in the contemplation of this sublime scene and the thoughts to which it gave rise, a dog, not far behind him, howled. It caused him to turn, and, with considerable surprise, he beheld a figure by his side. The apparition was so sudden and unexpected, in that complete solitude and in the dead of night, that it almost wore the character of a supernatural visitation. The stranger was a stout, rough-looking man, with a bold, bad face, and a deformed, club nose. He was dressed in a kind of frock or gabardine, open in front, and bound with fur. The cuffs were bound with the same material. He had on a low-crowned, broad-brimmed hat. His cheeks were sallow and sunken, and a long beard descended to his breast. By his costume Claude recognised one of those Polish Jews who are not unfrequently seen in the streets of Berlin. The stranger regarded him for a moment with a fixedness which increased his astonishment. “Who are you, and what do you want with me?” demanded Claude, in German. “It is a mistake, sir; I looked for another person,” said the Jew, in English. “How! You speak English! You know me for an Englishman!” said Claude, more and more surprised. The stranger, without answering, regarded him again from head to foot, and, suddenly turning away, disappeared in the shadows of the forest. Claude was at a loss to conjecture whether this incident was accidental, or whether it had any serious meaning. The man's demeanour was not that of a robber, but of one who had a desire to examine his features. There was something insidious in his manner; and his harsh and ugly face had an expression singular and discomposed. As his approach had been sudden and noiseless, so his retreat was abrupt. Was he a robber or an assassin? Had it been his design only to attack the careless passenger for the risk of such booty as he might chance to have about him? or had he intended to strike down some particular individual from a motive of revenge? and had he luckily discovered his mistake in time to withhold the blow? These were serious questions; but, long ere he reached home, they were forgotten in the new thoughts and fears —for hopes there were none—of the fair young girl whose presence already made Berlin the hallowed spot of all the world to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. Claude to Mr. Denham. “My dear Denham, “Your affectionate letter is received, and I sit down to answer it, half hesitating, notwithstanding the sincere friendship I entertain for you, whether I ought to comply with your wishes, and relate to you all the adventures of my life, and all the apprehensions which agitate my mind. You will not, even from this confession, doubt the sincerity of my sentiments; for you are, my dear Denham, the only man on earth whom I consider my friend. It is melancholy to reflect how few among all my acquaintance I place complete reliance on. Some who could, perhaps, appreciate the nature of true friendship, have their affections occupied elsewhere; and many, who exhibit a desire to become intimate, are not recommended by qualities which alone can make intimacy agreeable. Of the young men whom I have here associated much with, there is one in particular whom I have learned to esteem. Were we together for some years, I fear you would have a rival. But I am in this metropolis only for so short a time, and he is so much engaged with other avocations, that the interest we feel in each other will probably never grow beyond mutual wishes; for what would be the use of cultivating a connexion, of which the short period could scarcely be more pleasant than the inevitable termination would be painful? I see in this young man, however, much which resembles you. He is naturally noble and superior, born amid all the advantages of prosperity, and spending his life in a sphere of fashion and pleasure, among men beneath him in intellect; and yet, while he equals and surpasses them in the elegant frivolities of fashion, he has the taste and resolution to cultivate his understanding, and the wisdom to reason with impartiality and truth upon subjects generally the least understood in such circles. To see him in the drawing-room, you would suppose him only the gay and light homme du monde; while in his study he is evidently fitting himself for a career of usefulness. This much in reply to your inquiry respecting `new friends.' To your entreaty that I should leave off travelling and seek myself out a good wife, I have also something to say. I have many objections to marriage in my case. They are not those which generally influence men who remain bachelors. I have no prejudices against women, or apprehensions of the married state. On the contrary, I soberly believe no man can fulfil his duty, and enjoy all the happiness intended for him, without a family. The pleasures and affections—even the responsibilities, restraints, and cares which they produce, all tend to develop and balance his character, to enlarge his mind, and to keep his heart in a medium point of enjoyment most favourable to health, content, and honour. An old bachelor is almost sure to have some inaccurate notion or loose principle, which the reflection consequent on a family protects a husband and father from. No, my friend, do not suspect me of such flippant objections to matrimony; but there are others which I cannot easily overcome. You are aware of my general history, but I do not think I ever ventured to tell it to you distinctly, for it has been a subject not very agreeable for me to touch upon. I will sketch it for you, however, and let you judge whether it does not offer me solid arguments against marrying. “The earliest thing I can remember is a family where I was badly treated, in the West Indies. I was, at an early age, I scarce know how or why, taken from thence. I crossed the ocean, and was placed at an English school. I remained there till I was prepared for the University. All these measures concerning me were taken by invisible agents. I saw no one, knew no one, suspected no one. I became here acquainted with Lord Perceval, who was considerably my senior, and whose friendship has survived our school days. On leaving the University I received a letter. I have preserved it. It is in the keeping of Lord Perceval. The words are engraven on my memory. The writing was in an obviously disguised hand. It ran thus: “`It is time you should know sufficient of your history to keep you from inquiring more. You are the child of guilt. You have been cast off by one who for twenty years has kept a resolution, which will be inviolable, never to see you. Your existence is unknown to all but yourself and the writer of this, who, from a sense of duty, will not throw you utterly destitute upon the world, where all is false, and that most false which seems most fair. A yearly fund for your support, to the amount of £500, shall be deposited in the hands of the London bankers, N. B. &amp; Co. You can draw it in half-yearly instalments in advance. It is paid you from one cause and on one condition. The cause is this: You are said to have conducted yourself thus far with rectitude and honour, and to be not unworthy a better fate than the dishonour which you inherit, and which, luckily for your peace, blackens only on your forehead without festering in your heart. The condition of this annuity is as follows: You are never to seek to ascertain your real name and family. The first step you take with such a view will occasion the withdrawal of the sum; and your appropriation of it will be considered a pledge to that effect. Perhaps your pride may not readily accept a support under such circumstances. One who, however, has a right to command; who has educated you, and suffered for you, requests it. It will be continued for your life. It will then cease. Should you marry, it will be withheld. It is also desirable that you should pass the greater part of your time abroad. The strictest obedience will be exacted in respect to any search after your family; and you may the less reluctantly comply with this request, since, if you discovered all, you would only discover wretchedness, crime, and dishonour. May you be more happy and more virtuous than the wretches from whom you drew your being!' “You will not be surprised that I can write this communication from memory. I have read it over so often; I have examined and weighed every word with such careful scrutiny, and repeated it so frequently to myself, that it is engraven on my mind, and I have exhausted all the conjectures to which it can give rise. Who are my parents? Am I the offspring of some unhappy mother, who writes this document, and who, perhaps, as a penance, denies herself the sight of the being whom she has brought into the world? or is it from the pen of a father, who has been betrayed by the object of his confidence? Is my family noble or low? From some intimations, I almost infer that they are outcasts from the laws of society, and have taken this method of saving me from the odium and fatality of being known to be their offspring. Perhaps they are robbers, perhaps murderers. Perhaps the money I spend is the tribute wrung from society at the hazard of life and soul. These conjectures, and a thousand others, cross me. “Thus adrift upon the world, I have, as you may imagine, never had much temptation to marry. I have even never had the wish, till now. And, to cap the climax of the events with which fortune clouds my life, who do you think is the person who has first made me feel a weakness which I have so often derided? One as far above my reach as a queen; one in a dazzling sphere of rank; surrounded by haughty friends, who would deem me a lunatic for thinking of her, and who actually throw me in her way with a stray carelessness, from the very impossibility, as they suppose, of my ever having the hardihood to regard her with warmer feelings than respect. She is, moreover, affianced to another; she has accepted him, and she loves him. Her father himself told me so. He is our countryman, Lord Elkington, whom you have probably heard of, though I never did before. Do not suspect me of the baseness of seeking to win this happy girl's affections. No; I linger near her from a deep fascination, of which I am heartily ashamed, and which I shall by-and-by break through, leaving her for ever, but bearing with me an impression which will hereafter close my heart to all other women. I linger near her, also, because I am welcomed by the family with a kindness for which I know not how to account. I have endeavoured to withdraw from their hospitality, but could not without exciting attention and awakening inquiry. Not only do they oppose no obstacle to my being frequently in her society, but it seems sometimes as if they took pains to bring us together. Had she been but the poor daughter of some husband-hunting mamma, and I a rich noble, I might find here something more than accident. But, alas! I see this perfect freedom arises from the very antithesis of a design to entrap. It is my insignificance; the distance between my position and hers, which exempts me from all guards and suspicion.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Claude to Mr. Denham. “My dear Denham, “Your affectionate letter is received, and I sit down to answer it, half hesitating, notwithstanding the sincere friendship I entertain for you, whether I ought to comply with your wishes, and relate to you all the adventures of my life, and all the apprehensions which agitate my mind. You will not, even from this confession, doubt the sincerity of my sentiments; for you are, my dear Denham, the only man on earth whom I consider my friend. It is melancholy to reflect how few among all my acquaintance I place complete reliance on. Some who could, perhaps, appreciate the nature of true friendship, have their affections occupied elsewhere; and many, who exhibit a desire to become intimate, are not recommended by qualities which alone can make intimacy agreeable. Of the young men whom I have here associated much with, there is one in particular whom I have learned to esteem. Were we together for some years, I fear you would have a rival. But I am in this metropolis only for so short a time, and he is so much engaged with other avocations, that the interest we feel in each other will probably never grow beyond mutual wishes; for what would be the use of cultivating a connexion, of which the short period could scarcely be more pleasant than the inevitable termination would be painful? I see in this young man, however, much which resembles you. He is naturally noble and superior, born amid all the advantages of prosperity, and spending his life in a sphere of fashion and pleasure, among men beneath him in intellect; and yet, while he equals and surpasses them in the elegant frivolities of fashion, he has the taste and resolution to cultivate his understanding, and the wisdom to reason with impartiality and truth upon subjects generally the least understood in such circles. To see him in the drawing-room, you would suppose him only the gay and light homme du monde; while in his study he is evidently fitting himself for a career of usefulness. This much in reply to your inquiry respecting `new friends.' To your entreaty that I should leave off travelling and seek myself out a good wife, I have also something to say. I have many objections to marriage in my case. They are not those which generally influence men who remain bachelors. I have no prejudices against women, or apprehensions of the married state. On the contrary, I soberly believe no man can fulfil his duty, and enjoy all the happiness intended for him, without a family. The pleasures and affections—even the responsibilities, restraints, and cares which they produce, all tend to develop and balance his character, to enlarge his mind, and to keep his heart in a medium point of enjoyment most favourable to health, content, and honour. An old bachelor is almost sure to have some inaccurate notion or loose principle, which the reflection consequent on a family protects a husband and father from. No, my friend, do not suspect me of such flippant objections to matrimony; but there are others which I cannot easily overcome. You are aware of my general history, but I do not think I ever ventured to tell it to you distinctly, for it has been a subject not very agreeable for me to touch upon. I will sketch it for you, however, and let you judge whether it does not offer me solid arguments against marrying. “The earliest thing I can remember is a family where I was badly treated, in the West Indies. I was, at an early age, I scarce know how or why, taken from thence. I crossed the ocean, and was placed at an English school. I remained there till I was prepared for the University. All these measures concerning me were taken by invisible agents. I saw no one, knew no one, suspected no one. I became here acquainted with Lord Perceval, who was considerably my senior, and whose friendship has survived our school days. On leaving the University I received a letter. I have preserved it. It is in the keeping of Lord Perceval. The words are engraven on my memory. The writing was in an obviously disguised hand. It ran thus: “`It is time you should know sufficient of your history to keep you from inquiring more. You are the child of guilt. You have been cast off by one who for twenty years has kept a resolution, which will be inviolable, never to see you. Your existence is unknown to all but yourself and the writer of this, who, from a sense of duty, will not throw you utterly destitute upon the world, where all is false, and that most false which seems most fair.

      <field name="fulltext">Vol. I.—I CHAPTER XV. There are few, even in the sanguine period of youth, who look forward to a promised pleasure with higher expectations than Mrs. Digby experienced at the near prospect of her at length approaching début in the world of real fashion. Not all the wealth which the family had inherited could procure her admission into those enchanted regions in England. The very contemplation of them, however, as they appeared recorded in the newspapers, had disordered her imagination, as it does that of many others, who might be so happy in the positions where Providence has placed them, but who, failing in the modest independence and wise content which render men respectable and dignified in any situation, abandon what they are, in vain attempts to appear what they are not, and can never be—fashionable people. Long before the event which had raised her from comparative poverty to opulence, the sparks of fashionable ambition had been lurking in her heart, and they were fanned by her good fortune into a flame which no reason could quench. Poor Digby, although a blockhead out of his own sphere, and totally without cultivation, had still the sense to regret the tranquillity of his former life, and only suffered himself to be drawn abroad and to be implicated in his wife's schemes from good nature. But she, imagining that all that was necessary to become a stylish woman was money and admission into stylish circles, overlooked the fact that, without the gentility which nature gives, or, at least, that acquired by an acquaintance with such scenes, a person is only the more conspicuously excluded from them by being in the midst of them. She thought, good soul, that, once within the saloons of a palace, every obstacle would be surmounted, and her long-sighed-for triumph completely obtained. Her delight, therefore, was great, after having made the calls as suggested by Madame de Godeau, and having received, in return for her own, the cards of all the nobility and gentry of the metropolis. She was honoured with an invitation to a —what she called “deyjooney dangsang,” at Prince R.'s. She was now at the summit of her bliss. Carriage after carriage, for several days, had driven up and driven away, to shower upon her the cards of people whose dazzling titles made her head giddy with pleasure. So completely occupied was she with her grand design, that she paid no attention to the morning visits of Elkington, and the delight which the innocent and inexperienced Mary received in the attentions of that dangerous and bad man; and, if not blind to the fact that the blushes of her cheek were of a deeper hue than ordinary at the mention of his name, that the poor child bestowed double her usual care upon her toilet, and that she contrived to receive him often and long in the drawing-room, when no one but herself was ready to see him, she considered it as a token of her own success, and an omen of the brilliant prospects of Mary. In regard to expense, too, she became reckless. Her dresses were the most extravagant that could be procured. Her rooms were crowded with mantuamakers, coutouriers, marchandes-de-modes, coiffeurs, etc., etc., etc., and encumbered with furs, silks, bandboxes, and all the paraphernalia of a fine lady at the meridian of a fashionable season. In her own mind she believed that Mary's every-day increasing loveliness had ensnared the heart of Elkington, and a thousand visions, such as a weak and ignorant person in her situation might yield to, filled her fancy. The fête given by Prince R. was to comprehend the royal family, as well as the nobility and gentry of Berlin. The palace of the munificent host recalled in splendour the creations of Aladdin. The company assembled at twelve in the morning. The presentation to the royal family generally occupied the time till two or three o'clock, when a sumptuous dinner was followed by dancing and cards. At the appointed hour Claude entered the lofty doors of the palace, amid armed horsemen stationed at short intervals in the street, crowds of splendidly-dressed ladies, and gentlemen in the richest uniforms covered with orders—no one appearing in the royal presence in a citizen's dress. Such as have no military, official, or diplomatic character, wore the quaint court costume still to be met in the similar scenes of the present day. All the faces which Claude had been accustomed to meet at the nightly soirées of the past several weeks, he found reassembled in these golden halls. Some of the fair votaries of pleasure, who spend their lives in the same round, losing a portion of their beauty by the sober light of day, showed by their faces that even pleasure is a wearing toil, while others were only more pure and lovely in the searching beams of the sun. The pomp and display everywhere around him; the throngs of domestics, all in rich, and some in very fanciful liveries; the large scale on which everything seemed built; the numerous suites of broad and lofty rooms, adorned with every variety of splendour, and filled with exquisite paintings and statues; the floors inlaid in the most exquisite manner; the glittering crowds; the military uniform of the officers, with their gay plumes and clanking swords, all formed a coup d'œil which threw even the elegant magnificence of Carolan far into the shade. As Claude entered, a din of gay voices was audible. Those already arrived were gathered in three or four large saloons, waiting the arrival of the royal family. So distant is the reunion of the society, that, notwithstanding the short time he had spent in Berlin, he knew everybody. At every moment he was stopped as he advanced through the rooms. Many a hand welcomed him, and many a fair face greeted him with a smile. Lavalle, Beaufort, Thomson, and a score of other young men, in their smart diplomatic or court dresses, drew around him. “How are you, Wyndham?” said Beaufort, with a yawn. “It's devilish hot here. These déjeuners are quite absurd.” “Well, I think them, on the contrary,” said Claude, “very gay and pretty.” “Ah bah! you're so devilish amiable, there's no getting along with you.” “It is a very unfashionable fault,” said Claude. “Ah!” (a yawn), “I beg your pardon. What did you say? The fact is, it's such a horrid bore, being obliged to stand here eight or ten hours, that, really, I sha'n't get over it for a month. Why the devil don't people give suppers and have done with it?” “My dear Mr. Wyndham!” said Thomson, with a great multiplicity of bows, “how are you? you don't look well; let me get you a glass of orgeat —now do, I entreat you.” Claude thanked him. “Well! if you want anything to-day — if you wish to be presented to any one, lady or gentleman, or to any of the princes, mind and call me. At dinner-time I'll see that you have a good place, if you'll only let me know where you are. You'll have to be presented, too, won't you? I know all the chambellans intimately, and all the grandes maitresses. I'll look them up for you. I'll introduce you. It's very difficult, I assure you. Here, boy, bring the lemonade this way!” Claude again thanked his officious friend, and with some difficulty disentangled himself from his polite offers. “That fellow is perfectly in love with you,” said Lavalle. I 2 “He is very obliging, certainly,” said Claude. “He sounds your praises,” said Lavalle, “wherever he goes.” “What kind of a person is he?” Lavalle shrugged his shoulders. “A butterfly that flutters around the newest flower, and will show his wings in your path as long as it lies through the sunshine. One puff of wind will blow him away instantly.” “And Beaufort?” said Claude. “There was once good in him. He had feeling, if not sense, but it is merged in an insane desire to be considered a perfectly fashionable man. He has forgotten all standard of right or wrong but fashion. It is his morality. His whole character, mind, and heart are lost in it. To be blase is his happiness; he sees no good in anything, no charm in nature, no beauty in virtue, no excellence in character, but what fashion points to. Of course, his understanding must be weak to permit of such a transformation; but his heart was good when I first knew him. Now I believe he has none. It is not fashionable; and I am sure, to become the object of notoriety in his circle, he is now capable of any alienation from right—of any unprincipled and cruel action. He piques himself upon ridiculing all that is high and noble, and in being totally callous to whatever ought to touch his feelings. He considers himself a perfect homme du monde. By-the-way, I see you are very much lié with the Carolans!” “Yes.” “Take care there, my friend! It is dangerous ground. That girl is too pretty and amiable to be a friend to a person like you, without being something more; and yet, I observe, you seem much together.” “I do not think myself in serious danger,” said Claude, though this chance remark of Lavalle's made him tingle to his finger ends. “Besides, she is affianced.” “Yes, to that puppy Elkington.” “Puppy?” “Most thoroughly. There isn't a man on earth whom I detest more. He is going to marry Ida with no more real affection for her than you have.” “Impossible!” said Claude. “He can't appreciate her, in the first place. The match was made up by the families—and he has— now—actually fallen in love with another.” “What other?” said Claude. “That pretty English girl, Mademoiselle Bigby —or Digby.” “Miss Mary Digby?” “He is a man,” said Lavalle, “not only capable of doing the basest action, but of boasting of it.” “What do you mean?” “He boasts in his own set that this poor girl loves him. He is a frequent visiter at her home; and I have heard that she is so far his dupe as to have walked with him several times in the Park —alone. You are acquainted with them, I believe. It would be but right to put the family on their guard. They seem to be simple people. If I were the father of such a child, I would sooner see a viper in my house.” “I will tell him what you have heard,” said Claude. “But, for Heaven's sake, do so secretly,” said Lavalle. “You know Elkington is a fatal shot.” “No,” said Claude, “I will not do it secretly. I will inform myself better on the point, and, if I find it as you say, I will tell Digby the truth openly. I am no duellist. I have nothing to fear from him.” “That is to say, you would not challenge; but, were you to receive a message, you would go out, of course.” “No. It is one of those things which I have determined never to do.” “Well, you may be a very wise man,” said Lavalle, after a moment's pause; “but all I can say is, that, if you venture to carry that principle into action, you stand the chance of being a very wise man in a very embarrassing situation.” “I regard a duel as an act of too great folly and crime ever to be engaged in one,” said Claude. “That it is, I grant,” said Lavalle; “but the customs of society must be complied with.” “Granting that it is a crime, no custom can render it excusable.” “Yet declining a message may ruin a man for ever with the world, and, since we live in it—” “When duty points a path,” said Claude, “we have only to obey. The consequences I neither foresee nor trouble myself about.” “But the word coward!” said Lavalle; “the finger of scorn—the whisper—the taunt—” “Clouds,” said Claude, “which it is the business of an honest and brave man to walk through undismayed, and which will melt before his steady onward path, as vapours before the sun. A man of principle has an account between himself and God alone.” “Ah, this is very fine,” said Lavalle, “but I fear—” “Here is a partner wanted at whist!” said Thomson; “Wyndham, will you play? Lavalle, will you play?” Both the young men declined. “There's a useful person on these occasions,” said Lavalle. “He knows everybody and everything that is going on in society. He can tell you more scandal in an hour than you would believe in a month. I recommend you to accept his offer of hunting up the chambellans. He is the very fellow for it. And, as you have to be presented to several royal personages to-day, you have, I assure you, a task, in such a crowd by no means easy. Their royal highnesses are only to be caught in the intervals of the dance; and, when they are not dancing, the chambellans and grand maîtresses very often are. I will aid you if I am near. Till then, adieu. I see I am beckoned to.” As Lavalle left him, Claude strolled around the rooms as well as he could for the crowd. He met the Carolans. Ida was not with them, but in a few moments he saw her in another room. She was surrounded by a crowd of ladies and several gentlemen, among whom was Elkington, earnestly speaking with her. Claude did not approach. He stood aloof, with a feeling of tenderness and melancholy which he had never experienced before. He regarded her at a distance, unseen himself. She appeared grave and sad. There was even a slight paleness upon her countenance. “Alas!” thought he, as he stood motionless and gloomy, half withdrawn behind the pedestal of a golden vase; his gaze fixed upon her as on something sweet and lovely, lent a brief moment to his sight to be snatched from it for ever. “Alas!” he thought, “something has disturbed her. Would it were an evil that I could destroy—even with my life!” He knew not that the shadow over this young girl had been cast there unconsciously by himself. Since the night when, obedient to the wishes of her parents, and little dreaming that there was anything in her own bosom which could rise up against her, she had pledged her hand to Lord Elkington, new thoughts and feelings had been born in her heart. It was the very next day that she met Claude at her father's table. There was something in his appearance which struck her attention. The surprise and lively pleasure visible in his countenance on their meeting, the cause of which was unknown to her, made him a subject of reflection. His conduct to her, his coolness, subsiding into a tone of gentle courtesy, so different from the ordinary manner of the fashionable young men about her, fastened her thoughts still more upon him. The obvious jealousy of Lady Beverly and Elkington, who had observed the impression which he had made on her, rendered her still more observing; and several petty attempts to ridicule and injure him on the part of Elkington, raised the former as much as it depressed the latter in her esteem. In short, the inexplicable influence of a high and noble character had made upon her a new impression. The rudeness of Elkington at the opera, and the haughty, yet calm manner in which it was met, again placed the two persons in contrast to each other. It seemed that, since she sealed her fate by accepting the hand of Elkington, her eyes had, for the first time, opened to observation, her mind to reflection, and her heart to feeling. Placing no value on rank and wealth, since she had never known what it was to be without them, the inequality in the situation of Claude and herself did not enter her thoughts; nor, indeed, had she any more definite ideas concerning him, than that vague sentiment of admiration and interest which fills a young girl's heart on the threshold of womanhood, in the society of the man to whom she is about to surrender her affections. Claude presented to her in the real world a hero which she had believed existed only in imagination. She had given her hand to Elkington, supposing that she loved him; ignorant at once that her nature contained a deeper power of love, or the world a more worthy object. By that kind of caprice with which Fortune is apt to sport with human destinies, she began to experience a change in her feelings towards Elkington the moment it was too late, and to be, for the first time, conscious of that passion which has so much swayed the destinies of her sex. Thus situated in regard to each other, each began to be cold and reserved in proportion as their hearts were in reality drawn nearer together. Each began to treat the other in a way which, without intending it, hid their feelings from the general eye, while it rendered them warmer and deeper. But this reserve, even when most conscientiously persevered in, could not always prevent their meeting at moments when neither had the desire, nor the power to act their assumed part; and all who have had occasion to observe the boy-god's peculiar talent for transacting a great deal of business in a short period of time, will comprehend what changes were produced in the hearts of these two young people during such brief and sweet interviews. Many a confidence never trusted to words, took place between them. Many an opinion was communicated not committed to the tongue. In short, they were just so far committed to each other, as to afford no real evidence that there existed a partiality between them, and to leave that fact also doubtful in many moods of their own minds. It was in this state of mind that Claude met Ida at the fête of Prince R., and indulged himself with a long look at her beautiful face. Elkington was importunately pursuing her with a conversation in which she appeared to take no interest. Suddenly her eyes, as they wandered around the room, met his own. Her features were at once lighted with a smile of pleasure, and suffused with a faint colour, and she gave him one of those smiles which haunted his imagination, and sunk into his heart like poison. Elkington, who generally was too nearsighted to see Claude when at his side, now bent a keen glance on him. As he moved his eyes in another quarter, he perceived Lady Beverly peering at him through her glass. There was something of confusion in the manner in which he turned away, and, as if he were the object of some peculiar and mysterious scrutiny, he encountered the fixed gaze of Madame Wharton. She looked graver than usual. There was reproof, and almost severity in her expression. He approached her. “What does Mentor regard with such serious eyes?” said he. “I fear,” said Madame Wharton, coolly, “we are to be interrupted, for here comes his majesty.” At this moment the general clash of voices ceased suddenly, and was succeeded by a deep silence. An officer of the court entering with his baton, made a passage for the royal family. There was, however, little occasion for his exertions, for the crowd fell back on either side, leaving a wide space for his majesty Frederic William II., with the various members and guests of his family. The monarch advanced into the midst of the rooms, and Claude was presented by Lavalle to Prince —, the distinguished nobleman whose duty it was to name to royalty those who aspired to the honour of an interview. This ceremony was soon over, as well as those which etiquette rendered proper to the other illustrious personages. Having happily gone through these preliminaries, he was struck with the appearance of the Digbys. The good dame was magnificently arrayed in a brimstone-coloured, richly-embroidered satin dress, hat and feathers; a toilet somewhat conspicuous on any occasion, but unfortunately so on the present, since, the court being in mourning, it was the height of indecorum to appear in any other colour than black or white. “Oh Dieu, madame,” said Madame de Godeau, in an under tone, with consternation depicted in her countenance; “you are not dressed in mourning— when I tell you—mon Dieu—c'est épouvantable.” “You told me — mem,” said Madame Digby. “You never told me.” “Yes, I told you the whole court were in mourning.” “Ah, certainly, mem; I recollect that, perfectly, but I hadn't an idea you wanted me to go in mourning too. Why, I don't even know who's dead. I'm sure I have never seen the poor man in all my life!” It was, however, now too late for any remedy, and she determined to carry it through. She therefore followed the grande maîtresse, who had obligingly waited till the end of her colloquy with Madame de Godeau, and, with her elbows well protruded from her ample body, made her way through the opposing multitude with little ceremony. Here and there Claude heard a nearly suppressed “Ah diable, quel drole de figure!” or, “Dieu! qui est cette madame là!” Mary was dressed in blue, but she looked so extremely pretty, that even they who laughed at were compelled to admire her. Madame Digby, at length in good society—in the very centre of her much-talked-of ho-tong—stood in the presence of the princess with the air of one who intended to show the world that she was not to be intimidated. The distinguished lady to whom she was about to be presented seemed scarcely able to repress a smile, and the circle around were still less successful, at the awkward air and ridiculous affectation of the honest dame as she made her opening salutation. But royal affability on these occasions has no limit, and all in their presence are greeted with the courtesy which forms one of the ornaments of a throne. Half afraid of being encountered by one of Lady Beverly's haughty stares, Mrs. Digby was delighted to find the princess all smiles and blandness, and, recovering all her ambition with her ease, she cast a look around to assure herself that the whole assembly were witnesses of the honour she was enjoying. “Have you been long in Berlin?” said her royal highness, in French. An address in an unknown language would have abashed any one not blessed with considerable nerve; Vol. I.—K but bounteous nature had left no such deficiency in the composition of Madame Digby. She only, therefore, approached a step or two nearer—much too close for the distance which more experienced courtiers have a care to leave between royalty and those in its presence—and, leaning her ear towards the face of the princess, she merely pronounced, in her own peculiar way, the word “Mem?” The princess repeated the question. “I really beg your pardon, mem; but, if you could speak English with the same trouble, I should be more able to communicate with your ladyship, mem—that is—with your royal highness. Madame de Godeau informed me that you spoke English like a native, mem—your royal highness.” “I hope you find Berlin agreeable!” said her august companion, in English, and with a good-natured smile. “Well, mem, I can't say but what I do.” The princess began here another question, but Mrs. Digby interrupted her to add, “Your royal highness.” “Are you pleasantly lodged?” inquired the princess. “Why, mem, pretty fair, compared with where we were at Hamburg; but the stoves give Mr. Digby the headache, your royal highness!” “We know you English never find on the Continent the comforts which you enjoy in your own country,” said the princess, politely. “No, indeed, mem—your royal highness—that's what we don't; and as for—” “Are you attached to any embassy?” inquired the princess. “No, mem, not yet, but I believe we shall advertise for something of that sort; my relative, Lord Clew, was—” She was cut short by a very affable courtesy on the part of the princess, and an exceedingly significant look from the grande maîtresse on one side, and Madame de Godeau on the other, intimating that her interview was over. She accordingly made a salutation, such as, in her mind, fitted the rank of the person she addressed, and her own character as a perfectly fine lady, who had at length arrived at the very summit of the ho-tong; and, ignorant of the conspicuous violation of etiquette of which she was guilty, she stepped away, turning her shoulder and back directly in the princess's face. That lady not noticing, or not seeming to notice, the last manœuvre, turned towards Mary, who stood the next in the circle. The grande maîtresse led the trembling girl forward. Her timidity was so obvious, and she turned so pale, that the benevolent heart of the princess was interested in her behalf; and she addressed her so kindly, and led and sustained the conversation with so much consideration for her youthful and not ungraceful distress, that Mary found herself fully exempted from the necessity of making other remarks than her usual “yes” and “no.” The next object which attracted Claude's attention was Digby, the perspiration standing on his forehead, his face always rather rubicund from the vivifying effect of good English beef and beer, now heated beyond itself by the anxieties and horrors which, poor fellow, he had undergone in his attempts to be presented. Unacquainted with the faces of the royal personages, even when by their side, he sometimes ran against a prince, and sometimes made an inquiry of a princess. Some one whom he had never seen before was every moment wheeling him violently round with, “Prenez garde! —sa majesté!” or, “Monsieur, la princess!” At length, tired, terrified, and internally swearing that no one—not Mrs. Digby herself—should ever catch him again in a scene for which his habits of life had so little fitted him, his knees aching, and his feet in a state of torment from the effect of a pair of high-heeled and very small new boots, which his wife had persuaded him to purchase for the occasion, he reached a broad crimson sofa, glittering with gold, and occupied on the other end by a lady and gentleman. Throwing himself down in an exhausted state, he muttered half aloud, “Well, thank God! I'm here at last. Here sit I till dinner.” Taking out a yellow silk pocket-handkerchief, he deliberately wiped the moisture from his forehead and blew his noise; and he had just finished taking a comfortable pinch of snuff, and was proceeding to offer the box to his neighbour, when he was struck with the intensity of astonishment with which a little military officer, with an enormous pair of mustaches, an exceedingly rich uniform, a multitude of orders, a high chapeau under his arm, and a long sword, fixed his eyes sternly upon him. In some surprise, not to say consternation, he hastily put up his handkerchief and snuff box, and looked around to see what he had done, when he perceived that several others—indeed, all the surrounding spectators—were regarding him attentively, and with visible tokens of amazement. Among others, a person half behind him, and partly withdrawn within the embrasure of a window, began to make him significant signs and violent gesticulations, and, at length leaning over, addressed him. The remark was lost, however, in a language which he did not understand. At length he came to the conclusion that he had torn his clothes, and, horrified at the idea, he proceeded to examine his elegant court suit, when his perplexity was terminated by Claude, who, perceiving his dilemma and the cause of it, approached him from behind and whispered, “Get up. You are sitting with the prince and princess.” If a bombshell had fallen at the poor fellow's feet, he could not have been more alarmed. He started up, and was darting off to hide his humiliation in some distant corner, but Claude with a strong hand very quietly withheld him. “Good God! what now?” said Digby, afraid to move. “You are running directly against the prince royal!” “For Heaven's sake, then, let me go this way!” And, with a spring, he would have ran full tilt against another member of the royal family, had not Claude again checked his course. He remained, therefore, motionless, and resumed the task of wiping his forehead. “Well, I say—Wyndham!” he muttered, “if this is Mrs. Digby's ho-tong—!” The circle dispersed and Claude released his prisoner. It was not long before he observed him planted in a corner, with his back held resolutely against the wall, standing as straight as a grenadier under review, occasionally making a wry face at the pressure of his new boots, and now and then applying his handkerchief to his temples. At length a general movement of the crowd announced the dinner-hour. The Digbys had succeeded in finding each other. The quick eyes of the long-talked-of ho-tong, skilful in detecting a stranger to the forms of good society, had already found in these honest people an object of attention, and their various mistakes were scrutinized and repeated. Many a keen jest and sarcastic comment were passed at their expense. Every young officer amused his vis-à-vis in the dance (which had long been going on in the ballroom) with an account of what he had seen and heard; and certain ladies, whose lives are spent in a round of fashionable pleasures, and to whom these golden halls are the world, showed little mercy to the new, awkward intruders. K 2 The three hours which intervened till the moment of dinner had so completely decided their fate, that, had they been infested with the plague, they could scarcely be more avoided. Mr. Digby, aware that he had committed divers blunders, perceived plainly enough that he was coolly cut by many persons with whom he had previously enjoyed a speaking acquaintance. They passed him, and jostled him, and peered with their glasses into his face and out again; spoke to each other under his nose and over his shoulder, without taking any more notice of him, his wife, or daughter, than if they had been actually invisible. He strove to catch the eye of several, but found it impossible. The honest fellow, who, to do him justice, was quite innocent even of a wish to mount into a sphere for which his education had not fitted him, blushed at the slights he received, and cast a look upon Mrs. Digby in her brimstone-coloured gown and hat, which threatened hereafter to bridle her genteel aspirations, and never again to allow himself or his daughter to be subjected to such an awkward ordeal. Mrs. Digby herself was also becoming conscious that, although by management, aided by chance, one may push into such circles, they are more excluded while in the centre of them, by their different manners and education, than while quietly enjoying their natural sphere of society. She also had addressed several, and found herself unaccountably invisible, notwithstanding the numerous glasses which were from time to time directed towards her. Everybody was now advancing to the dining-rooms. The Digbys had been borne by the current into the centre of the largest saloon, in which the king and the royal family were already seated at tables. Here, at a loss where to go or what to do, ignorant of the language in which alone they could communicate with the servants, they found themselves deserted by all and standing alone, exposed to the full gaze of the royal family and the highest persons of the court. Mary's face was crimson with terror, Mrs. Digby's with exertion and astonishment, and Digby's with honest indignation. In this extremity, which was really growing unpleasant, he resolved to apply to Lord Elkington as a countryman and a gentleman, and as one who had been very often lately at his house, and who, when alone with him, had honoured him with several condescending remarks. He saw him just then coming through the saloon, having just terminated a brief conversation with Prince R—. “I find myself really obliged to ask your lordship—a—a—a—who—how—where—a—a—” Elkington turned his glass into his face, and, as if not recollecting him at all, said, “Pardon, monsieur;” and, pushing by, cast his eyes around as if in search of some one. “I'll ask Lady Beverly,” said Mrs. Digby, “where we are to go.” She advanced towards her, therefore, with an appealing look; but that lady drew herself up with a forbidding frown, which so frightened the poor woman that she had not a word to say. At this moment Ida came in with Madame Wharton. After their late rebuffs, the Digbys no longer dared to address any one else, and, entirely losing their presence of mind, as unable to withdraw as to retreat, and ready to sink into the beautiful floors, even Mrs. Digby began to regret the hour when she left her own circle of friends to make acquaintances with a rank of life so far above her own. At this moment Ida, who comprehended the awkwardness of their situation the moment she perceived them, stepped across the room, and, approaching Mrs. Digby, said, “My dear madam, I fear you are at a loss for a place. May I assist you? It is sometimes unpleasant here for strangers.” “Oh, mem,” said Mrs. Digby, “we shall be so very much obliged to you if you will show us where to go.” “With great pleasure,” said Ida. “I will tell a servant. I hope you are enjoying yourself to-day, Miss Digby.” “Oh yes, very much!” said Mary, emphatically. A servant coming by, Ida said something to him in German. He bowed respectfully, and led the way towards the door, while Ida, after a few more kind words to them, resumed her place. “That's an angel out of Heaven,” said Mrs. Digby, “if ever there was one, and that hateful Lady Beverly—” “And that scoundrel Elkington—” said Digby. “But, mamma, which was the servant the Countess Ida gave us?” “I did not look at him, I declare,” said Mrs. Digby. “And I was looking all the time at that beautiful girl,” said Digby. “You fool!” said Mrs. Digby, “what business have you to be looking at girls? now, you see, we're just as bad off as ever. I never did see such a born fool as you are, John, in my life.” “Oh, certainly, my dear; but who is the fool that's got us into this scrape?” The crowd, which for a few moments filled the saloon, had now again disappeared, and they were left once more alone; all the tables which they could see in that, as well as the adjoining rooms, being full. “Ah, thank God—there's Wyndham,” said Digby, taking a long breath, like a soldier who, set on by numbers, at length sees a friend on whose prowess and fidelity he can depend. He advanced to Claude, but he also, at first, seemed affected with the general defect of vision which prevented everybody else from seeing Digby's flaming physiognomy, although dripping under their noses. The eyes of our hero here were attracted to Ida and Madame Wharton, with one vacant seat by their side. He bowed, and the answering smile of Ida seemed to invite him to approach her, when the appealing voice of Digby arrested his attention. They explained to him their painful situation. All the company were now seated. In another minute they would have been in a yet more awkward dilemma than ever. Lady Beverly, who sat near, stopped from her soup to direct her glass towards the group, and said something which raised a laugh at the table where she sat. Claude longed to take the seat by Ida. It was, perhaps, the last hour of free intercourse with her which he should ever have the opportunity to enjoy. But had he a right, with such deep and now uncontrollable feelings, to seek the society of a young girl who, he already saw, was half aware of his madness, and was touched with it? The homely and awkward appearance, too, of the Digbys—for even Mary's expressionless face now looked vulgar contrasted with that of Ida.; the observation that all shrunk from them because they had rendered themselves ridiculous, and their obvious helplessness and dependance upon him, decided his generous nature to render them the assistance refused by everybody else. It was with an astonishment, of which the tokens were not wholly concealed from the object of it, that the surrounding circle saw Claude, who was among the most courted young men in the society, offer himself as the guide of the two ladies who were the subjects of such general derision, and, with an air of kindness and respect, lead them from the room. The broad stare and significant smile of Lady Beverly, and a rather loud remark from Elkington, which produced another laugh among the persons to whom it was addressed, neither intimidated nor embarrassed him, though he felt almost a pang on perceiving, as he left the room, that Elkington had discovered the seat by Ida and taken possession of it. The smile had left her face. Was it his imagination, or had a sentiment of disappointment, of sadness, come over her countenance? As she bent her head to him in adieu, was there a shade of sorrow, of reproach? While reason disclaimed, his heart clung with a deep melancholy, with a yet deeper delight, to the wild and impossible, but still-recurring and ever-enchanting thought. It was with some difficulty, and only on calling again the aid of a servant, that our party of strangers found at length vacant seats in one of the rooms down stairs. The kindness of Claude continued with the sumptuous dinner, and, aided by the succession of luxurious dishes and several glasses of Champagne, partly restored the Digbys to spirits. Not more than an hour and a half was spent at table, after which the company returned to the saloons, the cardrooms, and the ballroom. In the course of the afternoon, Claude led Ida through a contre-danse, for which he had already engaged her. The last look she had exchanged with him had been one of confidence, of tender reproach, almost of love. To his astonishment, he now found her cold and distant. He could not meet her eye, and there was a striking change in her whole manner. Nowhere is such a withdrawal of kindly feelings more easily manifested and more clearly perceived than in the continual interchange of attentions during a dance. The lifeless hand, the fingers given only at the last instant, when the exigences of the moment demand, and withdrawn the instant they are over; the eyes, the face turned away; all this Claude perceived in his companion with pain and surprise. He was chilled. How much agony may be suffered in a dance, which seems the emblem of happy feelings! He was the more depressed as he felt that his short acquaintance with Ida was nearly at an end; that honour as well as prudence demanded him to fly, and he had no excuse for asking any explanation before he left for ever the side of one who was dearer to him than all things else but duty. The dance was over. The candles were lighted. Ida turned away coldly and silently, without even looking on his face. He stood motionless, and forgot, and, indeed, had no opportunity to offer, those little marks of courtesy usual on such an occasion. The iciness of her manner communicated itself to his heart. A few moments afterward Elkington addressed her. Her face lighted up. She smiled again, gave him her hand kindly, and accompanied him to a new dance. During this scene Madame Digby was sitting alone in one of the entering rooms, tolerably tired of her ho-tong. Mary danced several times with the young officers, of whom many spoke English. Digby had sought shelter at the card-table, where Claude, as he passed, saw his face redder even than it had been before, with the troubles of that elegant game, which, to a bad player, however, presents a recreation not greatly different from being broken on the wheel. Claude stopped a moment to observe the poor fellow. Misery makes us superpathetic, and he could not help pitying him. He was playing with Thomson against two Prussian generals who did not understand English. They were large men in magnificent uniforms, with full-sized mustaches, and that stolid expression of countenance with which your avowed whist-player follows alike the surprises, disappointments, and triumphs of the play. A long line of tricks was quietly gathered under the right elbow of one of these taciturn gentlemen, which was momentarily growing longer, while Thomson, whom a desperate desire for a few rubbers had driven to take Digby as a partner, was sitting with a dark frown upon his face, and exclaiming every instant, “I don't understand your play at all!—What the devil did you play that for? and, How—you put your ace on my king?” The party presently finished. Digby, of course, had lost. Their adversaries had made “grand slam;” and the poor fellow found that, in addition to having been browbeaten and bullied by Thomson, and to having sustained several threatening glances when the rotation of the game made him the partner of one of the strangers, he had lost fifty Louis. “Well, thank Heaven! this is over at last,” said Digby in a whisper to his wife, as he found himself waiting on the stairs for the carriage, amid about three hundred people, who had the precedence of him; and, knocking his hat down emphatically on his head, “If ever you catch me—a—a—in—” He was interrupted by a cane with a large gold head, which obtruded itself unceremoniously under his arm, and pushed him gently and firmly aside, with his face against the wall. A stranger very politely took him by the shoulder, and whispering with an intense anxiety, “Madame la Princesse B—,” wheeled him round with his face to the front. “Monsieur,” cried an officer of the court, addressing to him a few rapid and angry words, which he could not understand; but, by the eyes of the speaker being fixed on the top of his head, he comprehended at length that he was to take off his hat, which he did. The princess, with her chambellan and maids of honour, now advanced, bestowing on all around the most affable smiles. The company stood close with their backs against the wall, and bowed respectfully. A little general, in his profound reverence and violent salutation, planted a foot nearly as large as himself upon Digby's instep, already nearly in a state of mortification from the effects of standing all day in too tight boots. The good man's lips were seen to move, and a peculiar expression passed over his countenance; but his voice was not heard, and the precise tenour of the remark which he made upon the occasion must be left to the imagination of the reader. The princess was immediately followed by the Carolans. Ida bowed politely as she passed, their servant making way for them to their carriage through the crowd of company and of footmen who filled the hall, waiting with their masters' and mistress's hats and cloaks. As they passed, Mrs. Digby exclaimed, “Why, where on airth is Mary?” It was true. Mary was gone. The moment before she had been at their side; she could not possibly have advanced towards the door, and must, therefore, have retreated. Astonished and vexed, Digby was just hastening back, when one of the princes appeared, and a stranger grasping his arm firmly to prevent his proceeding, he was obliged to remain standing where he was for about ten minutes, till his royal highness, having finished a conversation with an officer, passed out. He had no sooner done so than Digby forced his way back through the crowd till he again reached the rooms. He traversed the now deserted saloons with a hasty step, and fairly lost himself, so that he was unable for some time to find the way to go, or the door by which he had entered. At length, in a large apartment, he saw a portion of the company waiting till their carriages should be announced. Passing through this into an adjoining room, he found himself in a small but beautiful saloon, crowded with vases, paintings, statues, tall plants, and flowers. He saw no one there, and was about leaving it again, when a low voice caught his ear, and drew his attention to a deep recess, where, nearly concealed behind a trellis of thick vines, so arranged as to form a kind of bower, he caught a glimpse of figures. Advancing without ado, he came suddenly upon them. The first object which struck his eye Vol. I.—L was Mary. A gentleman was before her, holding her hand, which he covered with kisses. At the exclamation of the astonished father, he turned, and disclosed the features of Elkington. Digby knew that Lord Elkington was the affianced husband of the Countess Ida. He remembered his mean and rude conduct to himself and family a few hours before; a thousand circumstances connected with his visits to his home now rose suddenly in his mind, and, already goaded to a state of desperation by the mishaps of the day, he felt that his last drop of patience was exhausted. Advancing to him, with rage and vengeance depicted in his countenance, he said, “My lord, you will not be surprised if, discovering you in such a—a—a—position—in—a—a—with my daughter, I—a—ask—I—request—a—a—I demand of your lordship what are your—your—your —intentions respecting—connected with—a—concerning her.” Elkington saw in a moment that he was in a dilemma, which might be injurious to him if it should meet the ears of the Carolans; but, with the perfect effrontery of one accustomed to similar contingencies, and who knows himself possessed of a short and sure, as well as a safe way out of them, he said, “My good fellow—really—I positively don't understand you. My charming young friend will assure you that this is a mere jest—a trifle. I should have conducted her to her carriage in another minute.” “Sir,” said Digby, “you'll find me—a—a—not a person to be trifled with.” “Upon my word, I have no desire to trifle with you,” replied Elkington, laughing. “Your lovely daughter is such a very agreeable substitute. I believe, frankly, you have caught me rather off my guard; but what can a man do? If you will bring such an enchanting creature into society, you must expect her to turn our heads. Come, it is quite absurd, I assure you. I will call in the morning, and explain all; I will, positively!” “My lord, you are a villain!” said Digby. “How is that?” said Elkington, coolly, but losing his affected mirth. “I make some allowance for your temper and education, sir, but that is a word which you must unsay.” “I say you are a villain!” said Digby; “and, if we were not under a—a—roof—where—a—propriety restrains me, I would—whip you, sir—for your insolence—and your dishonourable—a—conduct to my daughter. I shall, however, write to Count Carolan a statement of this affair, and warn him that he is about admitting into his family a scoundrel in great points, as well as—a—a—puppy—my lord—in small ones. Then, sir, there is my card; you can send whenever you please, but I will admit you no more across—a—a—my threshold. You are a thoroughbred—a—a—puppy—a—a—a—puppy, my lord. Come with me, miss.” Elkington advanced to within a single step of his enraged adversary. He had very seldom, if ever, been spoken to so plainly. The only instance—and it was a case similar to the present—when an indignant father had thus poured out his wrath for an insult offered to him through his daughter, he had challenged him, and shot him through the heart before the expiration of tweleve hours after the offence. “My good friend,” said he, in a low voice, so that Mary could not hear, “you are aware that this is not a place for an affair of this sort. By giving your card, I presume you mean to say you are ready to offer me the satisfaction of a gentleman. If you have any claims to be one, you will speak of it to no one, and you shall hear from me in the course of the evening.” “Yes, sir—a—a—as soon as you please. Any satisfaction you desire is—a—a—at your disposal; and permit me to add, my lord, that the sooner it is —a—a—a—demanded, the sooner it will be—a—a—given.” “Well,” said Elkington, “we understand each other, then. I wish you a good-evening. Good-night, my love,” and he left the room, twirling his glove with an indifferent air. Mary had thrown herself on the sofa, and covered her face with her handkerchief, so that she did not fully know what had taken place. Digby drew her arm in his and hastened to the door, where he found Mrs. Digby in a fury on account of his long absence. She was, however, a little gratified to perceive a large crowd of miscellaneous subjects collected in the street before the palace, and to become, for an instant, the object of their fixed gaze and half-whispered admiration. As she stepped into her carriage, she felt that they at least took her for somebody, and that her peculiarly conspicuous toilet had here all its desired effect. Claude left these splendid halls with a heart as heavy as poor Digby's. He felt that, from some sudden cause, the half-woven tie of sympathy and love, which had bound him to Ida, was rudely broken. He was even willing that it should be so for ever. What was it which had thus changed her? As he got into his carriage he saw once more the young man, Mr. Rossi, whom he had seen in the pit of the opera and at the picture-shop. He was paler than usual. With his faded clothes and melancholy air, he looked poverty-stricken and diseased.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. Digby had scarcely got home, exhausted, hot, nervous, hardly able to breathe in his new clothes, which were too small for him, and completely mortified and depressed by the events of the day—his tight boots, not without difficulty, at length abstracted from his swollen and inflamed feet, and displaced by a pair of comfortable slippers, and his court suit exchanged for a loose robe de chambre—when Peter announced, with a respectful bow, “My Lord Beaufort.” “My Lord Beaufort!” said Digby, turning pale. “Why, what on airth can he want?” said Mrs. Digby. “Show him in,” said Digby, his head spinning round like a top, and not distinctly knowing what he had to expect. Lord Beaufort came in. He had changed his military court uniform for his usual dress, and he entered with a cool and composed air. “How are you, ladies? How are you, Mr. Digby? You've got home, I see.” “Yes, my lord!” said Mrs. Digby. “Thank God!” added Digby. “I hope you have enjoyed yourself, madam?” “Oh, excessively; it was quite charming, my lord,” said Mrs. Digby, feeling it as some remuneration for her sufferings that she was, at least, fairly in society with kings and princes, and lords and countesses. “You have not fatigued yourself dancing, I hope, Miss Digby?” “Oh no, sir.” “You're very fortunate. I think that sort of thing insufferable myself. They're horrid bores. The L 2 ladies frightful, with a few exceptions.” He intended this for a compliment, and marked his meaning with a smile to his fair companions, who both bowed, particularly Mrs. Digby. “Oh, my lord, you're so polite. It's quite charming!” said Mrs. Digby. “I positively don't get over one of these nuisances in a week. I can stand anything but a breakfast. Dinners, suppers, balls, soireés—we bear these—they are natural—we are accustomed to them—but—” “Your lordship don't like the dejooney-dangsang, then?” said Mrs. Digby. “Not at all, I assure you.” “Well, that's the only sensible thing I've heard you say yet!” said Digby, bluntly. “Ha! capital!” said Beaufort. “By-the-way, Mr. Digby, I have a request to beg of you. May I speak with you a moment? I will not detain you long.” “Is there a fire in the study?” asked Mrs. Digby; for she dignified a little room, where they kept the guide-book and the French grammar, with that name. “No, mamma,” said Mary. “Well, then, I'll tell you what—” “Well, what?” asked Digby, feeling it necessary to say something. “Mary and I will retire into our dressing-rooms. Mary, ring for Peter. Peter, call the maids. Miss Digby and myself wishes to change our toylettes. Don't decompose yourself, my lord, on my account.” “No, I won't!” said Beaufort. “Mary, my love—good-morning, my lord—by-by, Digby.” And, with an affected air before the handsome young lord, who, she presumed, had very likely called after Mary—perhaps to make a proposal— and upon whom she wished to leave an impression as a “personne distinguée,” she sailed out of the room. “A little trifle, I believe, has occurred between you and my friend Elkington, which he has requested me to arrange.” “Your friend Elkington is an infamous scoundrel,” said Digby; “an—a—a contemptible—a—a —unprincipled—cowardly—a—a—a—puppy—a— a—a—puppy, my lord.” Beaufort tapped his foot with his rattan. “I say, my lord, your friend is a rascal; a—a— very great scoundrel; and the most infernal puppy I ever saw.” “Don't let me interrupt you, I beg,” said Beaufort; “but, when you have sufficiently amused yourself calling him names, perhaps you will receive his message?” “His message!” said Digby, opening his eyes; for, so rapid had been the events of the day; so sudden the discovery of a person at the feet of his daughter, whom he knew he could not marry; so great his indignation, and so obtuse his intellect, that he had not, until this moment, distinctly conceived what the whole was to lead to. He repeated again, in a lower tone, “His message!” “Yes; allow me to hand it to you.” Digby took it, and read: “Sir: “The circumstances under which we last parted leave me only the alternative to beg you to name a friend to arrange the terms of a meeting at your earliest convenience. “Your obedient servant, “Elkington. “Mr. Digby.” “Why, this is—a—a—certainly—my lord—a— are you aware—how this—a—a—of the circumstances of the—a—a—that is—how this affair—a—a— sprung up?” “Who! I? Certainly not. I only deliver my friend's message.” “But do you know, sir,” said Digby, with feeling, “that I—I—I am a father—a husband—and a father, my lord?” “I certainly had not given the subject particular reflection; but, from the appearance of the lady called Madam Digby, and also the very pretty young girl who is inscribed on her card as `sa fille,' I am induced to think you are.” “Well, sir—that is, my lord,” said Digby, “I have only to tell you that I did not call your friend a rascal till he had proved himself one; not till being, in fact, all but—a—a—a—married to another lady —I—found—I perceived—a—a—I detected him— a—a—my lord, making—a—a—a—love—to my daughter.” “You may detect a gentleman in what you please,” said Beaufort, in a tone of very condescending explanation; “but you really ought to be aware that you must not call him a villain. That is a term to be answered only in one way.” “One?” “Unquestionably!” said Beaufort, laughing; “you seem to be strangely unacquainted with the usages of good society.” “But, my lord, I don't wish to give my Lord El kington the pleasure of that `one way.' Sir, I've just stepped into a fortune of £100,000 sterling, and I wish to enjoy myself a little. I am going to travel. I'm going to educate my daughter—to educate—to protect her—to settle her in life. What will Mrs. Digby do without me? Why, d—n it, sir, she'd make a greater fool of herself than she has done already. What would Mary do without me? She— an innocent, perfectly inexperienced girl, whom, even when I'm alive, I can scarcely take care of; whose beauty—and simplicity—and—a—a—helplessness of character, my lord—expose to the duplicity of every scoundrel like your friend, my lord—what's she to do when I'm dead? Her mother—so far from being a protector, sir—would be the very one to lead her into danger—into ruin—for, let me tell you, my lord, that Mrs. Digby is a very weak woman, as, it's my opinion, all the rest of them are.” “I have heard you very patiently, I'm sure,” said Beaufort. “And, for the confidence you have been so obliging as to repose in me upon the subject of your family affairs and prospects, and your opinion of the female sex in general, and of Mrs. Digby in particular, I must return you my grateful thanks; but what I am here definitely for is to deliver to you this note, and to request you to have the affair over as soon as possible. Couldn't you arrange matters this evening, and have it settled at day-break?” “If I'm to be shot,” said Digby, sullenly, “because I took my own daughter from the hands of a scoundrel, I perfectly agree that the sooner it's done the better.” “Will you name a friend, then?” “I haven't a friend in this infernal country, except, indeed, Mr. Wyndham.” “The very man! send him to me. I shall be at my rooms for an hour. We shall be ready to-morrow. Adieu!” And, humming an air from the last new opera, he took his leave. Digby sat a few moments confounded. However stupid in general matters, he had some feeling, too, upon things connected with his own affairs, and his heart swelled with anguish and indignation at the unprincipled conduct of Elkington to Mary, and his brutal intentions towards himself. His brain swam at the idea of being upon the threshold of the grave. It stunned him, and yet gave to his demeanour a serious and even dignified air. He was now, for almost the first time in his life, in danger; and he felt within his breast all the affection of a father, all the indignation of a man trampled on, and all the weakness of one unprepared to die, either in his mind or in his temporal affairs. He had never touched a pistol in his life, and he knew that Elkington was an avowed duellist and a deadly shot. Had he not known perfectly that he had no chance, in case of a meeting, of saving his life, his wrath was so great at the whole proceeding, that he would have gone out, even with pleasure, and committed the result to hazard. He had no moral scruples, no religious objections. He viewed his situation merely as it regarded his interest and that of his family; and he saw that, while to Elkington the transaction was but one of twenty similar ones, for which he was, by his principles and practice, always ready, which brought him comparatively no danger, and which, even if it should terminate fatally to him, would leave him in his last moment no regret but that of a selfish nature—no helpless wife—no daughter exposed, without defence, to the worst dangers which can threaten youth and beauty. Not only was the transaction to him certain death, but it would bring on a train of consequences, whose dark nature and vague extent were drawn in terrible perspective by imagination. Bitterly deploring his wife's folly in dragging him into circles of society infested with such vices and by such customs, with a trembling hand and a sinking heart he rang for the servant, ordered Mr. Wyndham to be sent for immediately, and requested his daughter to be called into “the study” alone. The poor girl appeared in a few moments. A faint suspicion of what was going on had entered her mind, and, at the sight of her father's pale face and gloomy expression, so different from its usual gayety, she felt that her fears were just. “Come here, Mary,” said he. “Come here, my daughter.” He drew her to him, and, passing his arm round her waist, kissed her twice. It seemed that she had apprehended a harsher reception; for at these tokens of kindness the tears rose to her eyes, and, throwing her arms around his neck, she said, “My dear, dear father.” “Have you said anything to your mother—about —about—” “Yes, sir; I have told her all. Indeed, she knew it before.” “Knew it before! why, what was there before?” “Lord Elkington's passion for me.” “Passion? Your mother—knew—” “All, my dear father.” “And has Lord Elkington dared—” “Oh, sir, he is sincere and noble; indeed, indeed, he is. He is one of the kindest, the best of men. He is all goodness, all condescension, all purity.” “And do you know that Lord Elkington is actually engaged to another lady?” “A match of interest—made up by his mother— in which, he has assured me, his heart is not in the least concerned, and which, since he has seen me, he is almost determined to break off; mamma says she's sure he will.” “And you, Mary,” said Digby, in a lower voice, trembling with rage, “have you been so—a—a— so silly—as to believe—as to—allow your—your— your—a—a—feelings to become interested in this man?” “Oh, sir—he—I—that is, mamma—” She burst into tears, and hid her face in his bosom, “The villain! The infernal profligate!” muttered Digby. “No, no, my father—” “Yes—I will teach him—I will—” But, ere he had completed his threat, all the absurdity of attempting to teach him the desired lesson by a duel rose to his mind. To-morrow, he reflected, at this hour, he might be a bloody corse. Who then would lead this simple-hearted girl through the snares laid for her? Here, in a foreign country, with only her mother, who was less wise, if possible, than herself. He actually trembled at the thought, and, for a moment, forgot his own danger in apprehension concerning his daughter. “Hear me, Mary—and the time may come when you will remember my words, and when the only mark of affection you can show me will be to follow their counsel—Lord Elkington is an unprincipled scoundrel. He has no idea of marrying you.” “He swore to me that he loved me—and only me,” said Mary, sobbing, “He is a liar and a scoundrel!” said Digby; “and I forbid your ever having anything to do with him. Mark me! I lay my command on you. If ever you speak to him again when you can possibly avoid it, I shall consider you as a disobedient and guilty child; and the curse of your father—whom your imprudence, perhaps, will consign to the grave—is all I leave you. I will have no Elkington in my house —I—I—a—a you—why, what's the matter, Mary?” The form of the poor girl, which lay on his bosom, pressed more and more heavily upon him, till he perceived her slipping to the floor, upon which she would have fallen had he not suddenly caught her in his arms. She had fainted. He rang the bell. Peter came to his call, and announced Mr. Wyndham, who entered immediately. He started on seeing the haggard and excited face of Digby, and the state of insensibility of his daughter. “What is it? what is the matter?” he exclaimed, in a tone of true sympathy, which touched the heart of Digby. “I am a ruined man!” said Digby; and he laid down his forehead upon the table, and hid his face during a moment of uncontrollable agitation. Mrs. Digby and two maids came running in at the confusion. “Take her, madam,” said Digby, “and see the result of your fine fashionable plans.” “Good God, John! what is the matter—and what has the fool been about?” “Leave the room, madam,” said Digby, with a real dignity which he had never discovered before, but which strong emotion sometimes arouses in the plainest character. “Take your daughter where you can recover her, and leave me.” “Why, do you think,” said Mrs. Digby, “that I'm a going to—” “Your daughter, madam, is dying perhaps, while you dispute your husband's orders; go, this instant, or I will never see you more.” The good dame, thunderstruck at the tone of authority in which he spoke, and awed by a something of determination in his manner which she had never seen before, turned pale and obeyed. When she was gone, Digby locked and double locked the door; returned, fumbled a moment in his pockets, turned pale as death, and, throwing down Elkington's note upon the table, said, “Read that letter, Mr. Wyndham.” Claude opened and quietly perused it. Digby then related the circumstances which had led to it. When he had finished, Claude said, “Well, and what of it?” “What of it?” said Digby. “Mr. Wyndham— sir—do you—a—a—inquire what of it—when I'm a—a—going to—to—to—be shot, in about twelve hours' time, through the head—and—a—a—with— a—a—like a wild duck—do you sit there and ask what of it? Upon my word—upon my honour— this is the worst of all.” “What is worst of all?” said Claude, calmly. “Why—your unfeeling, singular answer—a— a—and altogether—a—a—very unaccountable remark. What of it? What of it, indeed! Why, to such a friend as you, nothing perhaps; but, if you Vol. I.—M were called out to meet such a—a—a—infamous— bloodthirsty ruffian and avowed cutthroat as this —a—fellow—there would be, I presume, sir—a—a —good deal of it.” “No there wouldn't,” said Claude, with the utmost composure, “because I would not meet any man in a duel. I am not a married man myself, but—” “For which you ought to thank God!” said Digby. “Nor have I any one dependant on me for support and protection; yet even I will never—never meet a fellow-creature in a duel. It is a folly so gross, a cruelty to others so unfeeling, a remedy so inadequate, and a crime against man and God so obvious and so solemn, that no circumstance, however tempting, should make me commit it any more than I would rob a traveller on the highway, or murder an enemy in his bed.” You—don't—a—a—advise me—to—a—a—refuse this challenge!” said Digby. “I do, most positively.” “I was going to ask your services as a friend.” “To decline it, I will render them; to conduct any such negotiation with the alternative of a meeting and a death—never!” “But he will horsewhip me.” “That would be unpleasant, and, if possible, I would prevent it.” “I will carry pistols.” “No, I would not.” “What, would you be horsewhipped?” “Rather than commit a murder, or rather, particularly in your case, than be killed, and leave my family in such a defenceless state as yours would be. Perhaps I could not better choose the moment to inform you what I heard this morning of Lord Elkington and your daughter. He boasts openly of having acquired her confidence among the young men of the town, and has even so far worked upon her inexperience, by his promises and fascinations, as to persuade her into several walks with him.” “I will meet him,” said Digby, his face inflamed with rage. “I know not what may be the result— I will meet him.” “But I can tell you the result,” said Claude, quietly. “You can?” “He will kill you, and he will consider your death as an event of boasting and self-congratulation. Your daughter would be left then without a protector. You have—let me speak plainly to you, my friend—you have left your own circle of society to come into one where, unfortunately, a father may behold his daughter torn from him at midday, and be shot in attempting to defend her, without the law's taking any real notice of the crime; and you have brought this beautiful young child among men who deem it no dishonour to ruin her happiness and character, so long as they are ready to expose their lives in defence of their guilt.” “But if I refuse, what will everybody say? I will be posted everywhere—I shall—be disgraced and hissed at—as a—a—a—coward—and, moreover, if he attacks me in the street—but I will carry loaded pistols with me—and—” The perspiration stood in large drops upon his forehead as these alternatives succeeded each other in his mind. “Mr. Digby,” said Claude, “take my advice. I have thought more upon this subject, I suspect, than you. Duelling is not right in the eyes of God; it is against the law, against reason, against the rights and happiness of women. Your wife—your daughter—you cannot expose them to such a stroke without cruelty, selfishness, and real dishonour. Proceed no farther in this matter. Break it off altogether. If you are a man of sense as well as a Christian, you will see that your presence is urgently required here to take care of your family. If you are brave enough to die to save your name from an unjust and absurd aspersion, you have not the right to do so.” “But—I have given him my card—I have told him I would grant him any satisfaction—after this —can I retreat? can I withdraw? can I bear the— the—a—a—eye of the world? Won't the very—a —boys hoot at me as I pass along?” “What the boys or the world may do is not your affair. I will have nothing to do with a duel. You must seek some other friend!” “Let me ask you one thing; upon your honour as a gentleman, would you, in my place, refuse to fight?” “Upon my honour, I would.” “And dare you assure me that you never will either send or accept a challenge, under no matter what circumstances?” “I do, most solemnly.” “And do you, as a friend, tell me that you suppose there are other persons—respectable, good men—who believe as you do upon the subject of duelling, and who would not call a man a coward because he refused to fight?” “I do. I am certain there are many such. All who are truly Christians on the globe will praise you for it. All who have correct moral feelings will support you in it. All women will bless you for adding your influence to put out of fashion this bloody, senseless, and terrible custom.” “Will you carry my refusal to Lord Beaufort? He is waiting for you at his lodgings.” “I will. And I shall esteem myself too happy in being instrumental in preventing such a painful occurrence. Go, my friend, go back to your family. Continue their protector, their guide. The young girl who has unhappily occasioned this disagreement is, among such men as Elkington, surrounded by dangers from which a father's watchfulness can only preserve her. Let no false sense of honour cause you to desert the post where Providence has placed you; and, for the good opinion of men whom you despise, do not alike violate the dictates of sense, nature, and religion.” “I will carry arms, though!” said Digby. “No. Carry no weapon, not even a cane. Walk freely abroad, with no other shield than the moral influence of a good father and an honest man.” “And if Elkington should strike me?” “He will commit a crime against the law, for which I would no more be ashamed to go to the law for redress, than I would against any other act of fraud or ruffianism.” “Write me a reply, then.” Claude sat down and wrote: “Sir: “This afternoon, when I found you soliciting from my daughter promises of attachment incompatible with your relations with the Countess Ida Carolan, I used language which, if you did not deserve, the provocation must sufficiently excuse, without other apology from me. If, in anything which I said, you found an acquiescence in your suggestion as to a meeting, I must beg you to consider that I spoke in a state of mind when a just passion predominated over calm reason. Upon reflection, I find that my sense of duty to my family and to my Creator will not permit me to proceed farther in a course, where I can see no possibility of gaining advantage or honour, either in this world or in the next. I decline giving you the meeting you desire, and, at the same time, I forbid your future visits to my house.

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. It is to be hoped that the reader has had few opportunities to observe the heart of a libertine, when brought up in an opulence which offers the gratification of every wish, and without the restraining influence of principle or religious belief. His life spent in one unceasing round of vices, following every pleasure to its end, and with most zeal when most forbidden; indulging all his passions, never replenishing his mind with reading or instructive conversation, or purifying it by calm self-examination and wholesome reflection, he becomes at last totally selfish and depraved. Perhaps no characters could be more strikingly contrasted than those of the two young men now about to come into contact. The one was as completely base as the other was noble and disinterested. The one was destitute of all moral sense; the other would have died rather than commit a wrong action. Elkington was in every way Claude's antithesis, and, in painting a character so abandoned, we should fear the charge of exaggeration, did not history and the less extended annals of private life furnish too many examples. It is becoming a fashion in modern novels to mingle the good and bad so ingeniously in the characters of scoundrels, that one scarcely knows whether they are objects of censure or admiration; and Lady Macbeth has become the original of a race of villains, who commit crimes by fortuitous coincidences and with amiable reluctance. Experience has not led us to think that such examples in the portraiture of character are to be too implicitly followed. Unfortunately for human nature, there are, and always will be, men who, if tried, will be found utterly wanting; whose profligacy never stops while it has power to proceed; and whose very virtues only serve to render them more inexcusable and disgusting. Elkington was one of these—a libertine, a gambler, a duellist. He plunged into every temptation, without a thought of right or wrong. Ida had fewer attractions for him than the less intellectual beauty of Mary Digby; and, as far as such a person could be inspired with love, he entertained it for that beautiful but simple girl. The facility with which he impressed her heart encouraged him to proceed, while the difficulties in his path gave zest to the game, and furnished a sort of pleasing excitement. The answer of Digby to his challenge opened a new field to his passions. Claude Wyndham was the bearer of it, and he hated him with all his heart; and, from some yet unexplained cause, his mother, since their first meeting, had never ceased to speak of him with contempt and hatred, and to call her son's attention to everything which could cause him to participate in her sentiments; of this the chief cause was his standing with the Carolans, and his visible progress in the good opinion of Ida. Several circumstances, which had made Elkington suspect Claude had placed Digby on his guard touching his visits to Mary, would, without other grounds, have awakened the resentment of a heart familiar with plans of death. He had also reason to know that the note from Digby, declining his challenge, was written by Claude. From that moment he resolved to fix the quarrel upon Claude, and to pursue it to an extremity. No principle or religion checked his bad passions. He wanted a rival out of the way. He desired the destruction of a man, whose unbending rectitude rebuked his profligacy by its contrast, and whose fearless chivalry of character did not hesitate to thwart his unholy plans. The custom of duelling, sanctioned by the opinion of many, although denounced by the law, literature, taste, and religion of the age, offered a safe and sure means of executing his scheme. It is such men as he alone who are interested in preserving this bloody custom from the odium it merits. The honest man requires no such remedy. His life is the witness of his courage and honour; and the insults of the rash, or the wrongs and slanders of the wicked, pass from before his name, like clouds from the ever-unstained and stainless moon. Claude knew Elkington was base and malignant. He saw he hated him, and in his own breast a secret and strange dislike had risen with a strength which he could not wholly repress. It had been his wish to avoid any association with him. He regarded him as a dark and dangerous man, ready for any deed of open violence or secret fraud. Several things of which Lavalle had informed him, added to his own observations, enabled him to read his character correctly. It was, therefore, not without reluctance that he agreed to become the bearer of a message which might place him in collision with a person whom, from various considerations, he so much wished to avoid. But the idea that he might prevent a bloody catastrophe, that he might save Digby and Mary from the snares of a murderer and a libertine, induced him to forego his own desires. He had, as Elkington suspected, long since put Digby on his guard concerning his visits to his house; and it was from a generous impulse to defend the weak and to take part with the innocent, that he had given his counsel, written the letter, and borne it to Beaufort. Claude saw Digby the next morning. The honest fellow had received another visit from Beaufort of a conciliatory nature. Elkington begged to assure him that, if his principles did not permit him to adopt that mode of arranging a dispute, he would not press it upon him, and that, on condition of a mutual forgiveness, he would let the affair drop. But, should he ever relate their disagreement or the cause of it, he would consider it as a provocation to resume the correspondence. The delighted Digby—a mountain off his mind—promised everything, and secretly resolved to withdraw his family from Berlin as speedily as possible, and think of the matter no more. He regarded Claude as his saviour, and swore that, as long as he lived, he should command him to any extent, and that his purse and his life were, and ever should be, at his disposal. The friend whose good sense had rescued him from this disagreeable dilemma wanted neither, and took his leave with the pleasing consciousness of having prevented bloodshed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. It was a warm spring day. The sun was bright on the pleasant Linden, and the gay population were abroad enjoying the fine weather. Nothing is so delightful as the approach of spring in these cold climates. Claude was peculiarly alive to such impression; and, as he passed out of the Brandenburg gate into the universal and favourite promenade of the Park, he perceived tokens of the spring visible everywhere around him. This season had stolen upon him unawares. He had been so occupied in the world of fashion with operas, balls, soirées, and breakfasts; with glittering crowds, the same ever-recurring faces, and all the pomp, glare, and circumstance of magnificent entertainments, that the soft and exquisite forms of half-forgotten nature struck his eye and touched his soul with a sense of happiness. As the various incidents of the now vanished winter rose to his memory—the constant succession of brilliant fêtes—the numerous nights which had found him wandering amid the half-fairy splendour of royal saloons, till the breaking day at length sent him to his bed—the new acquaintances he had made—the dark face, full of meaning, of Lady Beverly—the rudeness of Elkington—the bland courtesy of Carolan—the dignified friendship of Madame Wharton—and last, not least, the enchantment which he had found in the society of Ida, and which had daily grown more delicious and more dangerous— all seemed a fantastic dream amid the surrounding silence and solitude. This beautiful forest was now deserted; the city population had not yet begun to appear in its sylvan glades. Only the squirrel paused and listened in the path; while the birds, whose clear notes echoed through the wood, scarcely flew at his approach. The grass had burst out everywhere, and the buttons of the trees were fully opened, disclosing the tender leaves and blossoms. Flowers, some the spontaneous tribute of nature, and some set by the hand of the gardener, were peeping from the wayside or bending over the streams. The earth, long dead, had a warm and living look. Verdure was upon the ground and perfume in the air. Two or three swans, stately as their mistress Juno, came floating down the stream, beneath the arch of a beautiful bridge which hung reflected in the flood; and the air, entirely free from the chill which generally accompanies even the fairest promises of a spring day, as painful recollections of the past sometimes disturb the pleasure of the present, was altogether bland and balmy. He walked on with a thoughtful pace. The con duct of Ida had been a kind of mystery to him. Since their cold parting at the dejeuner of Prince R., her manner had been generally so formal as to relieve him from the necessity of being on his guard; yet, at times, this reserve gave place to a gayety so familiar and a kindness so gentle as to startle him with the idea that, while he fancied himself only subjecting his own heart to danger, he was, in reality, also gaining the confidence of this artless and inexperienced girl. He had parted from her the day before, after an interview deeply interesting to him. The passion which had now taken entire possession of his soul had half betrayed itself in her presence, and the sweet instincts of a heart which had lost the power of directing itself, found in her manner so much tenderness even in its reserve, that he could not but doubt that his love was returned. It was at this point that he walked forth to reflect upon his position, with feelings which, although filled with happiness, were not of an enviable kind. What had he done? He had gained the affections of one affianced to another. He had weakly lingered by the side of one he could never marry, till perhaps their separation would be as much a source of unhappiness to her as to him. This was little more than the act of a scoundrel; and, in reflecting upon it, he experienced the humiliating consciousness of having deviated from the path of honour. Alas! so invisible are the lines which separate innocence from guilt, that the most honest sometimes find themselves over the limit before they are aware of it. No mortal step can assure itself against this danger; but, while the weak and the depraved go on in their career of temptation, the noble-minded start from the flowery road the instant they see where it leads. “Can I doubt it?” thought Claude, as he wandered into the thickest and most solitary part of the wood. “She shares my infatuation. Let me, for the first time, breathe to the air the secret which as yet hovers only in our dreams. She loves me. What power has aided my daring wishes? Some demon, perhaps, to effect my ruin!” In the ardour of his reveries, he had so far forgotten himself as to utter this rhapsody aloud. It was not without a guilty start that he heard a step at his side, and, lifting his eyes, beheld Madame Wharton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. The shock which the sudden sight of Madame Wharton sent through his frame, checked his hopes and brought him down to earth. He saw from her face that she had not only overheard his rhapsody, but that she understood the full extent of its meaning. Her countenance was grave and severe. Her air quiet and dignified, but full of thought and melancholy. There was something affectionate, but, at the same time, compassionate and even solemn in her manner. He remembered the playful contract they had made together, and he felt, in truth, like Telemachus, when the sober god reproved his weakness or warned him of his danger. The same recollection appeared to occur to Madame Wharton, for she exclaimed, “Oh youth! confident in times of safety, weak and worthless in the moment of temptation, how fortunate it should consider itself when age, which has passed the allurements of passion, and wisdom, which has learned to despise them, are near enough to rescue it from shame. Little did I think, when in sport I named you Telemachus, that, like the rash boy in the story, you would so soon and so imperatively require the hand of a Mentor to tear you from folly and sin, and cast you into the sea.” “Madame,” said Claude, “I scarcely know whether you are in jest or in earnest.” “Jest!” said Madame Wharton, almost sternly; and then, pausing and turning pale, she fixed her eyes upon his face with a searchingness of gaze which surprised and embarrassed him. “How strange! How wonderful!” she continued, in a tone almost of soliloquy. “What,” said Claude, “since you have overheard me, is it so strange that—” He stopped, for he perceived she was not listening to him. “Mr. Wyndham,” resumed she, presently, in a more familiar tone, “dare I hope I have read your character aright? Among men I have rarely seen one who could comprehend or fittingly reply to an appeal to the morality, the religion of a rational being, when it was opposed by his own interest or passion.” “Your opinion of human nature is a gloomy one,” said Claude, relieved to find that the companion who had acquired such influence over him did not immediately enter upon the subject which most occupied his mind. “And yet I fear,” resumed she, “that it is too just. I have not mingled actively in life, but I have regarded it constantly as a spectator, and I have seen much that made me despise, and much that made me pity it; but I have rarely met a man who was the being he was intended to be. I almost tremble to test one for whom I have conceived a strange interest. I almost shrink from searching into the heart of Mr. Claude Wyndham, to find whether the fair promise and the goodly outside are more than a mask and an illusion.” “Ah, madame! what would you say?” “I have long wished an opportunity of speaking Vol. I.—N to you in private. In those gay scenes where alone we meet, you are too much occupied with other and more agreeable thoughts to pay much attention to one of my age and attractions. But here—” “Say on, madame, though you do me injustice. There is not any one in Berlin whose acquaintance I am more delighted to maintain.” “Yes, one,” said Madame Wharton. Claude coloured beneath the calm eyes of his almost austere inquisitor. “Mr. Wyndham will do me the justice to believe me above idle curiosity or a vulgar desire to listen; but, straying through the wood for a walk, I saw you at a distance, and I have for some time followed and watched you unobserved.” “Watched me!” “Yes; not only to-day, in the ramble which you supposed a solitary one, but, since I first met you, I have always watched you. In the scenes amid which the winter has passed away, my former position in society has gained me a place, and my present relation with the family of Count Carolan has made it necessary for me to go. But age and poverty are not too openly welcomed in the gay halls of fashion, and, when admitted, are apt to become spectators of the pleasures of others rather than participators in them. From my quiet seat, Mr. Wyndham, I have followed your footsteps many and many an hour. I have seen the light of joy chase the shadow from your brow; I have seen despair succeed hope, and hope again banish despair.” “Madame!” “Did you think that, amid the pressing crowd, there were no minds but what were engaged in their own amusements? Alas! in a ballroom there is but a small part of the throng at ease. The fair scene, which seems given up to mirth, is watched by eyes which behold, without sharing, the enjoyment of innocence and the gayety of youth. Envy, hatred, revenge, mingle amid the multitude, glide through the dance, or sit watching from the walls; and with them also, sad meditation, memory pale and way-worn, to whom the giddy forms of pleasure only recall hours long vanished, and loved ones long in the world of spirits. Calm wisdom, too, my young friend, looks coldly on, and detects the serpent coiled amid the flowers—” “I hope—I fear—that is, I feel assured, madame—” “Hear me to the end, Mr. Wyndham. Among these mute but not idle gazers I have held my place, and you have been the principal object of my attention. Will you be offended when I tell you that I have followed your steps, read your actions, and traced all your thoughts and feelings? It has been the occupation of my winter.” “Madame,” said Claude, “by what right, with what object?” “Be assured,” she continued, “that only the truest friendship could make me think of becoming the guide or preceptor of any gentleman, however young or generous.” “I will interrupt you no more,” said Claude, astonished to find the reverence with which he listened to such curious avowals from one almost a stranger to him. “The words in which your revery found vent just now,” continued Madame Wharton, after a short pause, “while they furnish me an opportunity of addressing you, have betrayed to me nothing which I had not discovered before. You love the young Countess Ida. You will reveal to me the truth. I shall take the liberty to bestow upon you my advice, and I hope you will follow it.” “I will,” said Claude, yielding to this extraordinary proposal, and even with that feeling of relief with which a fainting traveller leans on the first passing stranger who offers to assist him. “You love the young Countess Ida,” repeated Madame Wharton; “speak to me as to your own heart.” There was a short pause. “I—I do,” said Claude, at length. “Notwithstanding your resolutions to the contrary—notwithstanding my warnings—notwithstanding that you knew her to be the affianced bride of another—notwithstanding the difference of rank between yourself and her—notwithstanding—” “Notwithstanding all,” said Claude; “since you seek my confidence—since I feel assured you are incapable of abusing it, I repeat, then, notwithstanding all, I love her. We are not the masters of our destiny—of our feelings. I cannot keep the sun from warming me, the winter from chilling me, nor such a mind and beauty as that of the Countess Ida from filling and mastering my heart.” “You have also,” resumed Madame Wharton, coldly, “in various ways, if not actually declared, at least betrayed, the passion you acknowledge.” “I think—I fear—I do not suppose—I never intended—” “Speak frankly and explicitly. I have ventured upon this interview from the consideration that your heart, if it is weak and wavering, is also noble; that the same capacity which gives it the force to love, tenderly bestows the yet higher power of acting heroically when duty requires.” Claude fixed his eyes on his inquisitor, as if he feared some demand which would try his resolution severely. “Madame,” he answered, “I cannot doubt that my admiration has been revealed in the long intercourse which I have had with this young girl. It has not been the result to intention, but my inability to prevent it.” “And you presume she has seen this?” “What can I think—what dare I conjecture?” “Let me put an end to your modest perplexity,” said Madame Wharton. “Ida does not know, does not dream you love her.” “How, madame!” said Claude, on whom this abrupt assertion inflicted a pang as painful as it was unexpected. “How can that be asserted? How can it be known? Who can penetrate into the recesses of a young girl's heart?” “I can,” replied she, coldly. “I know her every thought and wish.” “But—it—is possible,” said Claude, “that she may have never revealed—never confided even to you—even to herself—” “Secrets neither revealed to me nor confided to herself,” said Madame Wharton, “can scarcely deserve to become the foundation for such a fabric of hope and bliss as, I fear, you have reared upon them. But, to reply more definitely to your doubt; although some young ladies may have such ethereal secrets, Ida is not one who, even were she too timid to reveal them, could be artful enough to conceal them by any false statement; and she this day assured me that you are the affianced husband of Miss Mary Digby.” Claude coloured to the temples. “Madame,” he said, “I solemnly assure you there is not the shadow of truth in this, and you will eternally oblige me by—” “Undeceiving her—” “Instantly.” “For what end?” “For—for—in order that—” he stopped. “Is it your intention to offer yourself to Count Carolan as the candidate for the hand of his daughter?” “No, certainly—no, madame.” “Mr. Wyndham,” said Madame Wharton, “I take you to be one of the few who will never, from selfish considerations, deviate from the path of right. Intervals of weakness—periods when the mists and N 2 fumes of error blind the eyes and mislead the steps —I can grant you these. They are but tokens of that mortality, which God, for his own purposes, has made frail and feeble, and has sent adrift like a ship at sea, to meet the wild tempest and the hidden rock. I forgive you all the folly you have committed up to this moment in loving my young charge.” “Oh, madame, a thousand, thousand thanks,” said Claude. “We are, indeed, weak and frail—cursed with passions which we cannot command—placed amid temptations which we cannot resist—we are in the hands of fate—we are straws on the stream— we go down unresistingly into the whirlpool.” “You have pronounced here the silliest words that ever fell from the lips of an honest man,” said Madame Wharton. “You forget the character which alone distinguishes man from the beast, when you make him such a contemptible machine. No, sir, we are gifted with passions for the purpose of commanding them; we are placed amid temptations in order that we may resist them. It is the narrow mind and the vulgar heart alone which permit themselves to become straws on the tide. The lofty soul directs its course against the stream. It beholds from afar the whirlpool, and avoids it by the independent force lent by Heaven. The most sublime sight in the universe is a man tempted by the allurement of earth—the mental part within him urging him to yield—and, with opportunity to grasp that which he desires, yet, by the exercise of a self-controlling sense of right, passing by the thing he yearns for—living without it, and turning his back upon it for ever.” “I implore you, madame,” said Claude, “to speak to me freely.” “Then hear me! You cannot cherish an affection for Ida without a selfish criminality incompatible with the character of an honourable man.” The heart of Madame Wharton almost failed as she felt herself inflicting the greatest pang of which his nature was susceptible; but, like a skilful surgeon, who knows that firmness is the truest kindness, she went on. “The idea that you are a warm and accepted lover of Miss Digby, is generally received in Berlin. It was formally communicated to Ida by one who professed to have received the fact from your own lips.” “And that person was—” “Lord Elkington.” “I thought so,” said Claude. “It only confirms my opinion of him as a perfidious scoundrel!” “I did not myself believe it, and I give up the last feeling of esteem for Lord Elkington, as for any man capable of uttering a falsehood. But I must tell you that the belief of this report has been Ida's protection.” “Ah, madame—” “She does not love you—she does not think you love her. Your conclusions have been rash and impetuous; but, as yet, your actions have been more guarded.” “Oh, madame,” said Claude, “if I may—if I dare draw from your words the inference which they seem to admit, I should be the happiest of men. If I understand you correctly, she of whom you speak —but for an error which any moment may rectify, which cannot be long without exposure—would have learned the interest I have conceived for her, and that without displeasure.” “I am not prepared to make such an ample admission; but suppose it were true, what would be your course?” “I would throw myself at her feet—appeal frankly to her father and mother.” Madame Wharton smiled. “Ah, sir, you little know Count Carolan.” “Yes, madame; he is all bounty, all benevolence. Already he is my friend.” “Alas!” said Madame Wharton, “how much you require a guide! There is not in all Germany a man more imperative, more sternly despotic in his own family, more fixed and immutable in his prejudices, passions, and plans. His determinations once formed, all earth, all heaven cannot change them. No one is more haughty, more unrelenting, more aspiring, more devoted to rank than he. I assure you—for we are speaking in confidence—he would not only let you perish before he would hear of such a thing, but he would see Ida perish also; he would become himself her executioner, rather than see her married out of her sphere in life.” “What do you tell me?” cried Claude. “What I have told you long before—what every one would have told you, had you examined the subject before you staked so much peace of mind upon it; and as for his friendship for you, it is made up partly of the love of patronising, partly of the pomp of display. He is bland and familiar, because he thinks the distance between you so immeasurable that there can be no danger of your being confounded as his equal. Were you a higher personage, you would have found him more difficult and disagreeable. Long prosperity, immense wealth, have inflated his heart, and true sensibility is long ago extinguished in his bosom. The moment you wound the feelings, or especially the vanity of Count Carolan, you will find him an enemy as implacable as if you had committed against him the most flagrant outrage.” “Can it be possible? And where have been my eyes? What has made me so blind?” “You have not been blind, but only premature in forming your opinions. Men must not be judged in the drawing-room. They who are polite to you are not consequently good men, and Count Carolan, unfortunately, is a man of a conceited and cold heart, and a very feeble understanding. His god is himself. He thinks of nothing else; and there is no enemy so merciless as a fool. I give you these hints frankly, that you may know your ground, and not precipitate yourself publicly into any awkward position.” “And the Countess Carolan—?” “Like her husband, she is the worshipper of rank. It has become nature to them. Their tastes, or prejudices, perhaps, you will be pleased to call them, they have inherited, you must remember, from generations of haughty ancestors; and the tendency of their nature has been confirmed—if, indeed, it required confirmation—by education and example. You smile.” “I cannot but wonder that people should disregard the substance and realities of life, and sacrifice hope, charity, and happiness for empty names and glittering shadows.” “Continue, if you please,” said Madame Wharton, gravely, “to wonder and despise; but, till you are beyond the danger of error yourself, you must not be too severe upon those of others.” “May I ask if Ida—if the Countess Ida shares their opinions?” “Frankly, no. She has pride as high as theirs, but of a different kind, and she is perfectly safe from more than a momentary pang while she supposes herself less than the sole object.” “I understand you,” said Claude. “And now let me put this case to you,” said Madame Wharton, “as the Carolans—as the world will put it. You are a guest at Count Carolan's, recommended by an intimate friend. It is generally believed that you are all but the husband of another. This report, so universal that it appears impossible you could have overlooked it, is confirmed beyond a doubt by your conduct—I believe accidental, but others will not think so—towards the lady and her eccentric family.” “You amaze me. Pray explain.” “Your frequent visits to their house—your accompanying them to the opera—your openly expressed interest in the parents, which appeared possible to originate only in attachment to the daughter— their immense wealth—the girl's beauty, modesty, and grace—and your obvious devotion to them, and anxiety to be in their company at the déjeuner of Prince R—” “Gracious Heaven, madame—I assure you—” “Pray do not interrupt me. Whether true or false, this opinion prevailed; whether accidentally or intentionally, your own actions sanctioned it. Under these circumstances—thus the world will say —you stole into a noble and wealthy family, where your plausible demeanour gained you confidence, and your very want of rank placed in your way facilities which would have been cautiously withheld from a person less insignificant.” “Madame—” “Here, sir, you stole—for every member of the family believed you to be in a position in which, it appears, you were not; trusted by the father, who thought you above meanness—” “Madame—” “I am speaking not my own sentiments, and I am risking your esteem, which I greatly value, in order to let you learn, without delay or disgrace, what the world will say.” “Perhaps, madame, your imagination is too lively in drawing sketches of the future,” said Claude, haughtily. Madame Wharton regarded him as he lifted his tall form with an air of cold anger, and she grew as pale as he. Several times, indeed, in the course of this conversation, she interrupted herself to fix her eyes upon his face, with an interest which seemed independent of the subject on which she spoke. “Well, then, what the world has said,” resumed she. “It is the talk of the town. Your attentions to Ida have not been unobserved; and it is openly asserted that, under a false character—that of the affianced husband of another—which character you have assumed deliberately and supported with skill —nay, even under a false name—” “Madame—” “You have employed your winter in endeavouring to win the affections of an inexperienced girl— to raise yourself to a rank of life above your own— to relieve your poverty with her princely fortune.” Claude stood silent and haughty, scarcely knowing whether to conceive his companion an enemy or a friend. “I need not add, that, for myself,” said Madame Wharton, “I repose implicit confidence in the purity of your intentions and the nobleness of your character. You have unwarily allowed yourself to be surrounded by the illusions of a passion, as far removed from the possibilities of real life as perhaps it is superior in enchantment. As to my confidence in you, I have already given you tokens by addressing you at all on the subject, by speaking to you the language of moral right, by which a noble mind alone could be governed. I shall presently give you another, by preferring a second request. In the mean time, I thought it my duty, as your sincere friend, to make you acquainted (for there are others besides these of a very serious kind) with the calumnies going about respecting you; calumnies so painfully mixed up with truth as to require all your attention.” “Ah, madame,” said Claude, “do you advise that I refer them to the ordinary remedy in use among gentlemen, and which would procure me a vengeance which I do not desire, or render me a victim without clearing my name?” “No, sir. I have learned that you are from principle placed beyond the possibility of ever fighting a duel. It is that which confirms my respect for your character. It is that which makes you in my eyes superior to the common class of men, who are destitute of lofty and enlarged principles of action. I am above the weakness of suspecting your courage; but I rather admire it, because you have the dignity and the humanity to decline a duel.” “Tell me,” said Claude, after a pause, “what reports? The character which is not above calumny deserves it. An honest life is the only reply to a slander. What reports?” Yet, notwithstanding his efforts to remain composed, he felt the blood flowing more impetuously through his veins, and his cheek burn with shame and indignation. “It is asserted that you are not what you profess to be!” “Not?” “That you are a wanderer—an adventurer—in short, a chevalier d'industrie!” “Ah, madame,” said Claude, “you have done me, indeed, injustice if you supposed me likely to be moved by a piece of scandal so idle and so easily exposed.” “But how is it to be exposed?” “I should think Lord Perceval's letter—” “It is asserted that Lord Perceval never wrote that letter.” “A reference to him will at once—” “How—do you not know—you have not then heard—” “Heard what?” “That Lord Perceval is dead?” “Gracious Heaven!” “He is dead, sir. The news came by yesterday's mail.” “He was almost my only friend,” said Claude, his eyes filling with tears. The obvious sincerity of his astonishment and anguish touched and convinced Madame Wharton. Her own eyes also glittered through a hidden moisture as she said, “No, Mr. Wyndham; if you wish, if you will accept it, you may depend upon the friendship of another. I am in a position of life to do you little service, but my friendship may not be worthless. You are in a dangerous crisis. If I read you aright, you are capable of any self-sacrifice, and you will never shrink from duty unless the mists of passion hide it from your view. Let it be my task to waft these mists from before your eyes—to restore you to the coolness and dignity of a moral being—to lead you from hopes that destroy, and temptations that degrade you. You are on the brink of a precipice; one step, and you not only fall yourself, but—” “Madame, go on.” “She will perish with you!” “I tremble at your words,” said Claude, greatly moved; “a tumult of joy—hope—fear—despair— takes from me the power to think of anything but the half confession which you have twice made this morning. What is your meaning? What is your object? Have you come like my better angel, to bestow upon me, after all, the prize which would make me too happy for a mortal, or have you—” “I have thought you a person who could be better governed by honour than by other means. I have determined to trust to that character, which I think I perceive in you, to make no concealment; to lead you by none of the intrigues and duplicity which may be necessary in dealing with inferior minds. I resolved to show you the whole ground as it lies at your feet; to point to the path of passion, because your comprehension is enlarged enough to see where it leads; and to show you, on the other hand, that of duty, which I believe you will choose the moment you yield yourself to your habitual contemplations.” “I will do anything—I will follow any path— Vol. I.—O make any sacrifice,” said Claude, “which may be necessary for the happiness of Ida; but if she loves me—” “She does not love you,” said Madame Wharton, coldly, “but she thinks of you too much. She thinks you superior to other men. She has a mind to comprehend the difference between yourself and the gentleman to whom she is about to be united. She—” “Oh, go on.” “Had Heaven not thrown between you a chasm impassable—had no previous engagement existed between Elkington and herself—had she not supposed your affections devoted, your hand pledged to another—had she not beheld that other pre-eminently lovely, and beheld also, with all the world, your attentions to her, Ida might—” “Go on, madame, and I am your slave for ever.” “Might have loved you; nay, more, I will speak to you frankly, she would have known with you a happiness she can never know with Elkington, for I think you in character and disposition fitted for each other.” “It is the wildest vision of joy,” said Claude, “that ever blessed the eyes of a mortal.” “Relying on your honour as a gentleman,” continued Madame Wharton, “I have made you, in confidence, this confession, on two conditions. You said you would obey me if I would go so far, and I trust entirely to your honour.” “I repeat it,” said Claude. “Prepare to be put, then, to a severe test.” Claude's colour left his cheek. His ardent triumph had already subsided, and he almost held his breath as she continued, “In the first place, you will never act on the strength of the confession I have made you?” “I never will, madame.” “In the next—and I would never have revealed to you what has fallen this minute from my lips, but as an equivalent for the sacrifice I am about to ask of you, and, if you please, as a reward—” “Speak on; I know what you will demand. Banish me, if you will, to the farthermost corner of the globe. Indeed, I should have thus exiled myself of my own accord. I will leave her. I will never see her more. I will not even bid her one last adieu. I will fly this instant.” “I do not wish you to fly,” said Madame Wharton. “Not fly?” “I do not object to your seeing Ida again, as usual, on your pledge as a gentleman to bear yourself so towards her as if no such feelings had ever been between you. On the contrary, I should oppose any abrupt disappearance, which would only excite suspicion, awaken curiosity, and produce, perhaps, in her bosom an idea which I wish to avoid. Flight, perhaps, would be the easiest course for you—your mind once made up to suffer the interest which Ida has felt for you to be extinguished, without making an effort, even by a look, to rekindle it. Flight would be easier, I know, than this task; but it might leave in the heart of my young friend feelings which must not exist there; an image which must be entirely effaced. Her future happiness, her future duties require it. Fly you may, certainly, at the proper moment; but, before you fly—” She hesitated, and Claude also awaited, with a feeling of dread, the conclusion of her harangue. “Before you fly, you must assist in repairing the evil your imprudence and weakness, if not your guilt, have occasioned. You must aid me in extinguishing utterly the first spark which may have found its way into her bosom.” “And how am I to assist in this self-sacrifice?” said Claude. “How am I to immolate my reputation, my honour?” “If your object be her happiness, whenever you see the impossibility of her union with you, you will, for her sake, wish her to forget you. The expression of this wish in words is easy and unmeaning. Contribute towards it, sir, by your actions. Before you quit Berlin, she must believe you attached to another.” “That, you say, is already her opinion.” “So it is; but your manner to her has sometimes made it waver. Let it be so no more. Neither seek nor avoid her society; make no attempt to inspire her with a different opinion, but—” “What will she think of me?—that I have trifled with her peace in mere sport.” “Never be dissuaded,” said Madame Wharton, “from a course you know to be the right one by an idea of consequences. Perhaps, if her esteem, her respect for you were diminished—perhaps, if— if—” “She thought me a scoundrel,” said Claude, bitterly. “You would save her from the pangs which now tear your own heart, and may, perhaps, shade your future life with sorrow. If your position is awkward, you must remember your own rashness has placed you in it. Are you capable of this sacrifice? Have you the real love for her to sacrifice yourself— your nicest feelings—for her happiness, even when that happiness can never be shared by you; even when it will lighten the path and cheer the heart of your foe? Are you capable of acting from a high moral sentiment, unrewarded but by the approbation of your own heart and of Heaven?” “May I ask if you are authorized by the Count and Countess Carolan to procure from me these concessions?” demanded Claude. “Frankly, I am; and, more frankly, could you but have heard the terms of astonishment and indignation in which the count expressed himself respecting the affair, when at length informed of it by Lady Beverly, you would thank me for having interfered to spare you a collision with one who— who—once offended, knows no bounds to his resentment.” “And where originate the aspersions against my character?” “Have you no suspicion?” “Lord Elkington?” “Certainly. He and his mother have both perceived the growing interest you have excited, and are, I think, naturally enough, indignant at an interference so unauthorized, and so fatal to their happiness. Lord Elkington is, has been, and, though I know not why, probably always will be, your enemy. He is busy everywhere in blackening your name.” “I believe I know him!” said Claude. “Will you then consent, for the happiness of Ida, to the course I mark out for you? I speak, Mr. Wyndham, as a mother to her son. I am deeply interested in the happiness of this tender girl, and she thinks too much of you. Whether the feelings with which she now regards you deepen into love or subside back to pique—to indifference—to dislike, perhaps—depends upon yourself. Marry her you never can, under any circumstances. She is, moreover, affianced to Elkington, who is chosen by her father; and Count Carolan cannot be moved when he has made up his determination. He is one of those men who are firm because they are feeble-minded and cold-hearted. His vanity points ever one way, and reason and feeling have no influence over him. I should long since have implored mercy for Ida on this subject, had I not known that it would be useless. Besides, Lord Elkington's wealth, his rank, his great expectations, partly supply his deficiencies.” “They are poor substitutes,” said Claude, bitterly. O 2 “If, then, by word or action—if, even by a look, you exercise the power which you begin to possess over this innocent and yet happy girl—if you light the fire of hopeless passion in her now calm and peaceful heart—if, for a selfish intoxication of your own, you put that poison into her cool and healthy veins which now flows burningly through yours— if, without a higher or wiser object than the momentary gratification of your weakness, you thus darken and shipwreck her future life, young man, you are a villain, or a creature so weak and unworthy, that, to make her despise you, it will only be sufficient to paint you as you are.” “Spare me, madame,” said Claude, covering his eyes with his hand. “Give me your promise never to undeceive her in the belief that you love another—however humiliating to your pride, however harrowing to your passion—or fly and see her no more. Your flight will reveal to her the truth, rash and selfish boy; and you may solace your own misery by the consciousness that you have been the cause of hers. Yes, she will love you; she will see, then, that you love her. She is but too much inclined already.” “Ah! why may she not requite the sincerest, the holiest love that—” “Do not mock truth with words so false,” said Madame Wharton. “She will requite your love, but how? From that moment she will be for ever wretched. She will be given up to the tortures of disappointed love. Too well I know her nature. She might fly with you, perhaps, but she would carry ruin with her, and leave misery behind. You will be the means of introducing discord into the family that welcomed you with open hospitality, and of wilfully destroying the happiness of an inexperienced girl, rash enough to love, weak enough to trust you.” “If I throw myself at Carolan's feet—” said Claude, agitated; for these half admissions of Madame Wharton deprived him, in some degree, of his usual self-possession and good sense. “He will insult and spurn you. I have not thought it necessary to repeat the expressions he made use of when he learned the danger that threatened his daughter. If her life depended on her union with you, both her parents would rather see her in her grave. No one not nobly born, not able to support her in the sphere to which she has been accustomed, and to perpetuate the family honours, will ever receive the hand of Ida Carolan. She is the last of her race. Upon that child depends the continuation of one of the noblest families of Europe; and you, Mr. Wyndham—I ask it not in a spirit of unkindness—what have you to offer?” “I oppose no more,” said Claude. “I yield. From this time, neither by word nor look, will I prevent the state of mind you wish to produce in her. Ida is another's. Tell her of me what you please; I will never contradict or explain. I have been weak. I will be so no more.” “I trust you implicitly,” said Madame Wharton. “I hope you may do so, madame.” “And you will not leave Berlin immediately?” “I will remain till you yourself bid me go.” “It is a perilous task, young man.” “I will perform it!” said Claude. “She will never know,” said Madame Wharton, “how ready you have been to sacrifice your happiness to hers; but I shall not forget; you have done your duty. Not love itself, with all its charms, would ever make you so truly happy. Adieu.” She extended her hand. He raised it with reverence to his lips, and they parted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. Claude stood a moment motionless, in the attitude in which Madame Wharton had left him. He was stunned with the unexpected turn his affairs had taken, and the long and exciting interview he had had with this singular person upon the most interesting theme which could occupy his thoughts. He could not account for the influence she exercised over him. He sunk beneath her frown, and rejoiced in her smile, as if she had, indeed, been the Goddess of Wisdom in mortal form, descended from heaven to point out to his eyes, blinded with passion, the path of duty. Her tones swayed his mind and touched his heart with a persuasive power; and in her majestic countenance he traced lineaments which, in a singular degree, riveted his attention, and awakened his reverence and love. There are people who strike the eye at the first glance; produce an impression of beauty or dignity, which grows weaker the more they are seen and known. There are others who, without discovering themselves at first, disclose in each subsequent interview most interesting peculiarities of expression and manner. The form, before unobserved, moves with an increasing grace and charm, and the countenance discloses hidden powers. Madame Wharton was one of this kind. Claude could scarcely recognise in her the unobtrusive lady whom he first met in the diligence. The more he saw her, the more he admired and wondered, the nobler became her gait, the more impressive and intellectual her countenance. Her smile discovered a sweetness, and her eyes a light, which shed, even yet, around her features a kind of mellow beauty more imposing than the charms of youth. It was her character and mind which shone through her face and actions. When she quitted him—her eyes, lately so severe, bathed in tears—he could scarcely refrain from throwing himself at her feet. Indeed, he had done more. He had sworn to be her slave. The playful compact, originally commenced in jest, had suddenly turned to very serious earnest; and, at the command of this poor and neglected stranger —as if she had been an angry angel—he had pledged himself to abandon for ever the prize which seemed nearly within his reach, and upon which the whole happiness of his life depended. As he reflected upon the extent of this pledge, his feelings rose against it, and already he began to regret it. Under the fascination of this woman he had signed his ruin. “Yes,” he thought, “I have sworn an eternal adieu to Ida. Had it been but separation, I could have borne it with patience. The consciousness that we understood and loved each other, would have been, at least, one gleam of sunshine on my path; but this is a tearing asunder of heart and soul. And, if I feel pain, I know I shall inflict it. I shall meet her coldly. Her gaze will once more seek mine in vain. Her smile will be unreturned. She will wonder. She will tremble. She will think me capricious and treacherous. Horror at such baseness will be succeeded by shame, and shame by resentment. What will become of me? and what will become of her, if she throw herself away upon this profligate? Perhaps she will degenerate into a mere woman of the world. With him she cannot be happy, unless she ceases to be what a woman should be. With me, even in poverty —ah! dangerous and useless thoughts! some demon breathes them into my mind. I must indulge in them no more. Whatever pangs it may cost me, the path I have chosen is right. I knew it even before this strange being arose, as if out of the earth, to shame me from my weakness. Yes, I renew the oath. Ida—sweet angel—for ever adieu! Only image of earthly happiness, I waft thee to the winds!” As he walked on, the afternoon sunshine fell bright and yellow upon the forest floor. The birds warbled in the branches—all nature seemed full of joy. His way led through devious paths and over fairy-looking bridges; and, penetrating yet farther into its hitherto unexplored recesses, the wood appeared to grow deeper and lovelier every moment. After a winter devoted merely to scenes of fashion, the peaceful and familiar forms of nature struck his long unaccustomed eye with a beauty which he had never before so keenly perceived, and to which the tender anguish of his soul only rendered him more susceptible. Everything seemed bathed in enchanting hues and disposed in graceful outlines. He was gifted with a lively feeling of that exquisite perfection which lies even in the rudest and commonest forms of nature, and his eye did not fall upon a spot of the earth or heaven without receiving a sensation of wonder and delight. Sometimes, through the long avenues, he caught a vista of the meadows softened in the distance—the windmill casting its broken shadow upon the ground—or the sail gliding peacefully along the narrow Spree. The leaning trees, with their rough-barked trunks immediately around him, tinged with silver or clothed with hoary moss; the brown earth, with its glittering pebbles—the tender lawns—the soft clouds sailing in the blue air, like swans on a transparent flood —the whole scene, and the reflections of it, hanging inverted in the water—all touched his soul with pensive delight, and made him sigh to gaze on a world so lovely, and to feel that, amid the thousands who enjoyed it, he was an outcast and a wretch, to whom its very charms only brought an augmenta tion of sorrow. He stopped and looked around him. A piece of rude timber, the half-hewn trunk of a tree lately felled, and not yet removed by the workmen, lay rough and silent beneath an old oak; but the light fell upon it in such a way, that, had it been formed of ivory or gold, it could not have been more beautiful. A little farther on lay a plough, partly over-turned in a track of black earth—its print left in an unfinished furrow—its bright steel edges glittering in the yellow light through the heavy pieces of mould which adhered to it. In the mellow sunshine its worn handle looked like amber. There was something in the sight of it which aroused a new train of reflection. He gazed on this rude utensil. It seemed to reproach the idle and careless life which he had led in the pursuit of fashionable pleasures; of a luxurious and vain mode of life, as little suited to his means and condition as to the true dignity of human nature. What had he to do with fashion—with costly pleasure—with weak love? This simple image rose in his path like a rebuke— a type of that toil to which the guilt of the first criminals consigned the human race, and which he had never known. For how many ages had it been consecrated by the sweat of honest and humble hands, of which some, perhaps, with equal firmness, might have held the helm of state or the truncheon of war—the monarch's sceptre—the poet's pen? “Sturdy emblem,” he thought, as he continued to muse, for it was in musing, instead of action, that his life had passed away—“simple type of manly labour and independence—ancient instrument which a benevolent Creator has given to a race he wishes to save—at whose touch the brown earth opens and gives the golden harvest, that sheds joy and splendour over the fields and valleys, and sends peace, and sleep, and plenty into the cottage of the poor. Ah! why did not fate make me but the contented master of one of these!” And he went on, dreaming as youth dreams, till aroused by the cold touch of reality to less pleasing occupations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. He was interrupted in his reveries by a sudden burst of military music, and he presently found himself arrived safe at a road which was thronged by the beau monde who drive from the town, and, leaving their carriages, here walk to enjoy the fresh air and sunshine. At the present moment it was occupied by a body of troops stationed on one side. A crowd of spectators were ranged in a large square. Among them he saw Digby with a party. They were on the opposite side; and the honest fellow, discovering Claude, immediately started to join him. He took the shortest way, which was through the hollow square. He had not advanced many steps when two or three sub-officers shouted to him; then two or three more. Not understanding the language, and not supposing their shouts directed to him, the honest fellow walked on, leisurely twirling his glove, and his face lighted with pleasure at the sight of his friend. His pertinacity, however, in continuing to advance, after the sentinels had ordered him to come back, awakened strong symptoms of wrath in those arbitrary personages. Seven at a time started off after the rebel who so coolly put them and their commands at defiance. Digby had got about two thirds of the way, when he was surprised by a heavy blow across the shoulder, and, on turning round, the self-satisfied smile at once vanished from his countenance, as he beheld seven soldiers, each nearly as many feet in height, the lower part of their faces half hidden beneath mustaches, and their countenances red and their eyes flashing with rage, and making violent gesticulations at him, in the course of which their drawn swords sometimes flourished so near to his ears as to put him in considerable trepidation. One took him by the shoulder and twirled him round with little ceremony, while he asked him a vociferous question totally unintelligible, which he had scarcely heard, before he was spun round by another, and then by a third, to his infinite indignation and dismay. At length— upon shouting out, at the top of his voice, in horrible German, that he did not speak that language, and making his persecutors comprehend that the reason why he had not turned back when they called him, was, that he did not understand what they said, or knew that they were speaking to him—one gave him a shove, and another honoured him with what was very nearly a kick, and he was hauled and thrust back into the nearest point of the crowd before Claude could get to his aid. “Did you ever—a—a—Mr.—a—a—Wyndham —see anything—so—so—a—a—infamous as the proceedings of those gentlemen? If I don't—a—a —understand their—a—a—cursed, stupid language —is that—a—a—reason—I appeal to you—for them to—offer—a—a—a—to kick me in that style? If there's justice in Europe, I'll—a—a—have it.” It was with difficulty that Claude could refrain from laughing at the intense indignation of his friend; but he endeavoured to sooth him by telling him that, after he had got through the French, he could learn the German in a short time. If anything could have added to Digby's rage, it was the idea of learning more languages. “No,” said he, “I have quite enough with the French, I assure you; and a more ridiculous and— a—a—a—absurd and—a—a—I never heard. The infamous scoundrels! Ah! yonder comes my wife with old `long pockets.' ” Vol. I.—P As he spoke, Mrs. Digby, with her daughter and Mr. Lippe, came up. “Well, Mr. Wyndham,” said Mrs. Digby, “did you ever see such an awful fool as John is? I told him he could not go across there, and yet he thinks he knows best. Did not you catch it, now? To be kicked and cuffed in that style before all Berlin— but he thinks nobody knows anything but himself.” “Agreeable, ain't it?” said Digby, in a whisper. “To be first knocked about like a shuttlecock by those infernal scoundrels, and then bullied in this style by one's wife. The fact is, Mrs. Digby's a very excellent woman; but—” And he placed his finger significantly on his forehead, and made a grimace intended as an insinuation against the sane state of that lady's understanding. “But bless me! how pale you are, Mr. Wyndham!” said Mrs. Digby. “You must be unwell!” “No, not in the least!” “You do, indeed, look very pale,” said Mary. “Now join us—do; and take a little walk—do,” said Mrs. Digby. “It'll do you good, I'm sure it will. Mary, take Mr. Wyndham's arm. Now I sha'n't wait for an invitation. Any one as knows me knows I'm all above board, and no nonsense; so I'll take the other. Now, John, you and old Lippe can take a stroll across the square, if you've a mind to, and have another tussle with those gentlemen. Ha! ha! ha!” “I must say, my dear,” said Digby, “that I think your — a — a — wit is considerably more—a—a— conspicuous than your—a—a—manners.” “By-the-way, they say your great friend, my Lord Elkington, is getting on famously. They say his father's at the last gasp.” “Do you call that getting on famously?” said Claude. “Why, he thinks so, I'll be sworn,” said Mrs. Digby. “They say that they ain't the peaceablest family in the world, and, when the old fellow pops off, then my lord will be the Earl of Beverly, and so rich that he won't be able to count the guineas.” “But, holla!” said Digby, “here he comes on horseback.” “And the whole set of them,” said Mrs. Digby. As she spoke, Elkington and Carolan, with Ida between them, rode up. The Digbys saluted them very ostentatiously. Ida bowed. Her eyes fell on Claude, and her sunshiny smile went to his heart. It had been his first impulse to step back, so as not to be seen with Miss Digby, after the report which he had just heard was current upon the subject; but he remembered himself in time to prevent such a step, which, trifling as it was, would not have been in strict accordance with his promise. She saw him, therefore. He bowed carelessly. It seemed as if Mary hung more closely on his arm as she passed. He saw that Ida had perceived her, and that it would confirm her belief. Elkington and Carolan both evidently recognised the party, but neither bowed; and, as they were riding at a brisk pace, they were soon out of sight. “Well, she is a pretty creature,” said Digby, “and a kind one.” “Do you go to Monsieur de B—'s to-night?” asked Claude, by way of saying something. “Not I,” said Digby, bluntly. “I go nowhere in society again.” “Well, I do,” said Mrs. Digby, bridling up. “As you please, Mrs. Digby—as you please— but I don't—and that's as unchangeable—as—as— a—a—I don't budge an inch.” “Are you to be there, Mr. Wyndham?” inquired Mrs. Digby. “Yes, madam!” said Claude. “Well, I sha'n't,” said Digby. “Now, my dear papa—” “Now, John—” “I've said, it, ma'am,” said Digby, with an air of fierce determination. “I'll have nothing more to do with your ho-tong. Why, a man can't even sit down there, sir, and he can't stand up, for fear of— a—a—turning his back to some one; and he can't go away, for fear of leaving some one behind him; and he can't walk, for fear—of—a—a—finding some one—a—a—before him; and I can't dance, and I can't talk. I lost thirty Louis the other night by attempting to play. Thirty Louis in—a—a—a— one night!” “John,” said Mrs. Digby, “how can you be such a fool?” “Well, fool or no fool, Mrs. D., I tell you, once for all, I won't go. I won't — a — a — a — go — ma'am.” “Why, mamma,” said Mary, as if suddenly struck with a good idea, “why can't Mr. Wyndham take us? He just said he was going, and we can call for him in our carriage!” “Why, good Lord! so we can,” said Mrs. Digby; “what a set of fools we are, to be sure. Certainly —plain as day. Pray do us the kindness, Mr. Wyndham.” “If you please, madam,” said Claude; and he reflected upon the pleasure his appearance with them would give Madame Wharton; how it would gratify Elkington and Lady Beverly; how it would confirm the opinion and alienate the feelings of Ida. It was arranged, therefore, according to the proposal of Mary, that he should attend the Digbys to Monsieur de B—'s, the minister. Claude now looked up from a brown study, and observed Monsieur Lippe, to whom he addressed some commonplace observation. “Ah! you've got hold of our Mr. Lippe, have you?” said Mrs. Digby. “Well, he's a droll fellow, to be sure. You needn't look so astonished; he don't understand a word we say, poor devil. It's just like being with a dumb beast. He's a most useful person, though, I assure you. He lives with us now altogether.” “Indeed!” “Oh, yes. He interprets for us—teaches us German and French—does a great many useful jobs about the house—orders the things we want from the shops—buys everything—pays all our bills— makes all our bargains—and reads the French tactics to Mary.” “The French tactics!” “Classics, mamma,” said Mary. “Well, child—classics—tactics—it's all the same, you know, in Dutch; we never stir without him; in short, he's our right-hand man—our chief cook and bottle-washer; and, what's very remarkable, too, he doesn't charge scarcely anything for his services. He only gets three thalers a week, besides his board. He offered to come for that; and it was so scandalously cheap, I could not refuse it. Now this was one of my bargains. It would have been a long while before John would have had the wit to make such a one.” “Yes, a confounded long while,” said Digby. “I believe he knows everybody and everything in the world. He is the most agreeable, honest, simple creature. He has, I assure you, no more idea of taking care of himself than a child of six. The other day I gave him twelve groschen to buy something for himself; and what do you think—he came and returned me back a groschen, saying he had got the article for eleven. He is the greatest prize in the world; and we're so much pleased with him, that I made John let him go to a tailor and choose himself a complete suit of clothes. You see he's very fine about these days.” Indeed, now that his attention was directed towards him, Claude observed that he was certainly P 2 improved in appearance. He was very showily dressed, in the height of the fashion; smelled strongly of eau de Cologne, and had more the air of a dandy than a person of his unobtrusive profession. Thus apparelled, he had assumed the character of a favourite steward or man of charge, taking this interesting family under his guidance as we see a cicerone take a party of bewildered and obedient travellers. Sometimes he made them stop to point out the residence of a great man; sometimes to call their attention to a view through the long arcades of trees, which here and there, like the aisles of a Gothic church, extend for a mile or two beneath the arched branches, till the straight line fades to a point in the perspective. Here he made them walk a long way round to avoid a damp place, and there he conducted them, even contrary to their wishes, where they might feel the sunshine. But what pleased Madame Digby more than all was, that he frequently addressed the family, or spoke of them as “monseigneur” and “milady.” In short, Mr. Lippe was fairly installed, and began to grow fat and sleek upon sleep, cessation from care, and hearty living. His late meager face had filled up into a very respectable outline; and his complexion, from a dry olive, had assumed a more rubicund and greasy look. No one gave more elegant soirées than Monsieur de B—, and he received in the same splendid manner once a week. In the evening, as had been arranged, the Digbys called for Claude, and he accompanied them to one of those entertainments. Often before had he entered this spacious palace, and ascended to those very rooms with a heart beating with hope and love. How bitterly did he now lament his folly in having indulged such dreams and still more in having betrayed them to the confiding girl whom he was now to meet with assumed coldness! How strange was his position. In order to be worthy of her, he was to throw her away. His clear reason whispered that the surest way to leave her to happiness was to inflict upon her what he knew would be a severe present misery. It is not every young lover who would have the resolution to attempt such an undertaking. “Yes,” he reflected, as he ascended the steps, “I will render myself despicable in her eyes; and, when I see she despises me, I will leave her and these scenes for ever.” And, amid gay voices and happy smiles, the forms of the careless crowd pressing by him in their pursuit of pleasure, and the music from the distant ballroom already floating on the air, with Mrs. Digby on one side of him and Mary on the other, he entered the saloons of Monsieur de B—.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. The growing passion between Claude and Ida had not been unobserved. Lovers are like the ostrich, who, when his head is under the bush, thinks himself unseen. The report that Mr. Wyndham was engaged to Mary Digby had at first arisen naturally from the circumstances; had been strengthened by Elkington and his mother, at first, from a mere malicious desire to injure him in the fashionable world, where the strange intrusion of Mr. and Mrs. Digby had been the occasion of much merriment. His own conduct, as Madame Wharton remarked, had, however, unintentionally confirmed the idea. In his frequent intercourse with the Carolans he had soon become an object of close attention to more persons than one. Madame Wharton had watched him with various emotions, such as a good spirit might feel in beholding from the heavens the course of a beloved friend over this dangerous earth. Lady Beverly had fixed her eyes on him, as a malignant being waiting an occasion to injure or ruin him. Among her stronger influences was that of envy. She was so weakly bound up in her son as to be almost blind to his moral worthlessness; and she regarded with disgust the elegance of Claude's person, and the superior intelligence and grace of his mind and manners; and she could not but see that there was “a daily beauty” in his life and character, in the presence of which Elkington appeared to the greatest disadvantage. Other thoughts, of a much deeper and darker nature, there were, half-floating in her mind, which deepened her dislike of Claude into serious apprehension and hatred. As for Elkington, although he commenced by slighting and despising Claude as a man of no fortune, rank, or fashionable pretension—as a mere stranger, whose sphere of life was sufficiently indicated by his intimacy with the Digbys, he found, upon a nearer contact, something about his rival which, while it rendered him less insignificant, also rendered him more hateful in his eyes. The unconscious delicacy and warmth of his manner towards Ida, he perceived, was met on her part by a congeniality which he himself had never excited in this young person; and as the match was, he well knew, one of mere convenience, he at first feared, and then felt, that the love which he had failed to inspire was bestowed, although unacknowledged, and perhaps unknown by either party, upon Claude. The quiet contempt with which his rudeness had been returned by the latter, the sentiment of inferiority which he could not help being conscious of in his presence, and the arts of his mother, who, for reasons of her own, desired to widen the breach between them, even to any extremity, all nourished in his bosom a hatred which grew with every day, and was by no means abated by his rival's success in society, where, from his own merit and obvious superiority, he was received with the liveliest welcome. Both he and his mother had made secret attempts to find out something definite respecting his family and history which might be used to his disadvantage, and had thus far been partially successful. By certain means they had discovered the mystery which involved his birth. This was openly hinted in every company, in a way calculated to cast suspicion on him. The occurrence already related between Digby and Elkington suggested to the latter a new mode of gratifying his resentment. He had dropped Digby in the affair, and was determined to provoke Claude to a challenge by the most open and insulting statements respecting him. Several persons had mentioned them to Claude, but he persisted in the determination not to call his slanderer to account. This refusal to fight was carefully revealed to all the society, accompanied by every term of exaggeration and contempt, and hence arose the reports to which Madame Wharton had alluded, that he was an adventurer, without even the pecuniary means to support the life he was leading, or the courage to resent the most unequivocal insult. It was said that he had come to Berlin only on a speculation of marriage, and that the letter from Lord Perceval had been forged. These calumnies were so openly spread by Elkington that they were generally believed. The very height at which Claude had stood in society—the admiration with which he had been received—a certain air of nobleness and independence which marked his manner and conversation, and the favour of the Carolans, were all against him. Envy chooses the fairest victim, and slander loves a shining mark. It is astonishing with what facility the world at large grasps at the vaguest calumny against those who have appeared superior, and how instantly a whisper against an innocent woman is hatched into a tale of guilt, or a hint of evil is caught and bandied about when directed against an obviously honest man. But poor Claude—who had lived, since his arrival in Berlin, in a kind of enchantment, spellbound by the side of Ida, welcomed in circles which may become dangerously attractive to persons of his lively temperament, and lingering amid scenes of wealth, rank, and love, so magnificent and fair, that it seemed as if he stood by the open gate of Paradise, where a word from the lips of Ida might establish him for ever—poor Claude had not such obvious evidences of his standing and character as to put a stop to the allegations against him. After the first impression, caused by lies, as to his powers as a man of superior mind and education, had subsided, people began to wonder that they did not find out who and what he was. Since Carolan had been made to comprehend that there was danger in his society to Ida, he had, without inquiry or discrimination, resolved at once to consider him as an enemy, and, as such, to speak of and treat him. This had a most injurious effect upon him, as the withdrawal from him of the first patron who had introduced him into society could not but be received as a confirmation of the unfavourable rumours current respecting him. In the game of whist there occur periods when one finds every chance obstinately against him. Fortune seems not only accidentally capricious, but malignant; and the best player is beaten, not by the skill of his adversary, but by an unseen power in the air. How often is it thus in the more important game of human life? The poor mortal finds his utmost exertions vain, and contends against un-friendly influences, which mock his wisest efforts, and turn them against himself. It seemed now thus with Claude; he was placed in a most painful position. Principle called upon him to make sacrifices almost beyond his strength. First, to turn from the person he loved, and even to behold her about to despise him, without making an effort against it; and then to repel a direct charge against his character only with the mild weapons of explanation and forbearance. How little did they know him who suspected him of cowardice! It would have been a relief to call into the field the insolent calumniator who had so often insulted him by his manner, and was now endeavouring to complete his destruction. In his present state of mind, death would not have been unwelcome; but he felt that the ball which laid low the slanderer of his honour would not clear his name; nor did he, the moment he reflected, really wish to take the blood even of Elkington. His thoughtful mind recoiled from the image of a fellow-creature stretched in death by his hand, and his very conviction of the profligacy of Elkington rendered him averse to send him, “with all his imperfections on his head,” into the presence of his God. Whatever might be the temptation or the consequences, a long cherished habit of implicit submission to the dictates of reason and duty, an innate delicacy and magnanimity, and a profound piety, made him firm in the resolution to go through life without imbruing his hands in human blood, or without consenting to offer his own to blind error or profligate passion. Where he knew he was pursuing the course of duty, no earthly consequences could make him shrink. “I have sacrificed my love to a sense of right,” said he; “shall I not sacrifice my hate? And does my reputation demand that I shall kill or be killed? Will the death of Elkington prove my honesty—my fortune—my claims to respect? Will it even clear my name? Will it not, on the contrary, consign it to infamy, and deprive me of the opportunity of disproving by my actions the aspersions against it?” He therefore determined to persevere in his course—to pass the slanders of Elkington without other notice than an offer of such proofs of his real character as were necessary, to Count Carolan or any other friend or friends—to avoid being drawn into a quarrel with his enemy—to disentangle himself as imperceptibly, but as completely as possible, from the sweet ties which were beginning to exist between him and Ida, and then to withdraw himself from the scene of so much trouble. He scarcely knew how difficult was his task. On entering the apartments of Monsieur de B— with Mrs. Digby and Mary, he perceived immediately that he was an object of attention; nor did it require many moments to discover that this attention was not of the flattering kind to which he had been accustomed. Slander had done its work, and of all those who had been till now so affable and friendly, scarcely one recognised him without a coolness which formed an obvious contrast to their usual manner. Inexperienced in life, although he had heard of calumny, he was not really acquainted with it. He had not thought of its effects. In paying his addresses to Monsieur and Madame de B—, he fancied he saw in both a change not to be mistaken. Madame de B— was a beautiful but proud woman, careful of her smiles, and disciplined even in the art of directing her looks only according to the fashionable worth of the object. She was an interesting and delightful companion among her friends —Claude himself had, till now, been her peculiar favourite—but her eye, as she coldly returned his greeting without encountering his, was cast down, and immediately lifted to a person behind him, with whom she entered into a sudden conversation. Although this was apparently accidental, Claude felt it was a manner of avoiding him. The reception extended to Mrs. Digby and her daughter was equally cold. Monsieur de B— bowed slightly to each of the three, and extended his hand to a gentleman who passed before Claude. He felt the blood mounting to his temple. It was his first impulse to turn on his heel, and never again to enter this or any other Berlin mansion; but he checked these hasty emotions with a calmer pride, and the independence belonging to his character. He reflected that he did not know how far this slander was credited—that perhaps the manner of Monsieur de B— and his lady might have been accidental—that flight would countenance the falsehoods respecting him—that he had resolved not to seek, but also not to avoid Elkington—that he had a duty to perform towards Ida —and—for he was in the habit of thinking of others as well as himself—he had brought Mrs. Digby and Mary, and they would not wish to be abandoned. He resolved, therefore, to remain. He felt also that his high spirit would meet the incivility of the whole assembly, if necessary, without shrinking, conscious as he was that he did not deserve it. As he turned he found himself next to Carolan. If the scarce perceptible change in the manner of Monsieur and Madame de B— and several others had surprised him, he was much more struck with that in the demeanour of Carolan. All the bland suavity of that gentleman had disappeared. It was scarcely possible to recognise him. His figure was drawn up with an ostentatious hauteur on seeing Claude, which left no doubt of his changed sentiments. His manner was stiff and pompous, his nose elevated in the air, and his features expressive of self-satisfaction, superciliousness, and contempt. The instant Claude's eye fell on him, he perceived that his polite and agreeable friend was no more; but that the folly of his character, now brought out by circumstances, had left in his place a very different person. He scarcely knew whether to address him or not; but, as he had yet received no cause to withhold from him the ordinary courtesies of society, he bowed as usual. The count looked him full Vol. I.—Q in the face without offering the least sign of recognition. A slight laugh at his shoulder caused Claude to turn; he found that it proceeded from Elkington. At his side was the Countess Carolan. Calmly, but proudly, Claude bowed to her. It seemed that he required from each one the evidence that they could so wantonly insult him before he could believe it. His dignity and manly composure carried a kind of conviction to the heart of the Countess Carolan. She believed in that instant that he was calumniated, and she bowed to him with her usual kindness, and held out her hand. There is something of intuitive perception in the eye of a sweet woman, which, in such matters, reaches the truth through the darkest clouds. Gratitude was one of the strongest sentiments of Claude's soul, and it was expressed in his countenance, as he took her hand and returned her salutation. The change in his expression, from haughty scorn to sincere pleasure, was not lost upon her, and a perceptible moisture in her eye betrayed the feeling with which she sympathized with him in this, the most trying moment of his life. At a little distance stood Ida. She was very pale, and turned away her face as she perceived that his eyes were directed towards her; but, as if unable to complete the effort, she looked back once again, and that look glanced to his heart, and thrilled him with an unutterable delight, which was instantly quenched in anguish as he remembered what he had undertaken to do. At this moment Thomson came up. This young man had been so violently his friend as to have even annoyed him with attentions. He had perceived long ago the enmity growing between him and Elkington, and had spoken to him in the strongest terms of disgust of Elkington's character and insolence. Claude, ill read in human nature, held out his hand to him as one of whose support in the hour of need he was secure; but, to his surprise and embarrassment, the young man passed his extended hand unnoticed, and, seizing that of Elkington, shook it heartily, with many expressions of pleasure at seeing him. A few moments afterward he saw him taking Elkington's cup to carry it to a table, and ordering a servant to bring his lordship more tea. “And is this human nature?” thought Claude to himself, as he quietly regarded the young sycophant, and remembered the importunity with which he had besieged him in a happier hour, and particularly the expressions of contempt and disgust which he had made use of to him concerning this very Elkington, whom he was now serving with the assiduity of a valet. It was plain that a total change had taken place in the general opinion respecting the once admired Mr. Wyndham. Nearly all chilled him by the coldness of their manner. Some, although gazing through their glasses, found him as invisible as they had found Digby. A few addressed him without apparent knowledge of what was going on; and two or three made it a point to come up to him, to speak with him long and familiarly, and, by more than usual kindness, seemed desirous of soothing his feelings, of counteracting the effect of the conduct of the rest, and of showing him that they gave no credit to the calumnies in circulation. He remarked that these persons were generally those who had been the least forward to make his acquaintance when he was in the meridian of favour. They were the sensible, the amiable, and the truly virtuous, of whom Providence has scattered a few through the world, like flowers in a field, and who, like flowers, often bloom unseen in retired places, never courting the public gaze, and blessing with their odorous breath and perfect beauty only those who have the fortune to find and the heart to appreciate them. Others there were who—probably absorbed in more important subjects, mere spectators of these scenes, where they came to divert themselves from abstruse labours, and to make their observations upon the world—met him exactly as usual; one gentleman, a tall, noble-looking officer, came up to him, and, giving his hand, said, “Mr. Wyndham, without ceremony, I make myself acquainted with you. I am General St. Hillaire. I have heard certain calumnies respecting you, which, by Madame Wharton, an old friend of mine, I am taught to believe totally unfounded. I learn also that you have had, from principle, the magnanimity to refuse sending a challenge, and to leave a slanderer to the contempt he merits. Sir, I honour you for it. I wish other young men had your firmness; although I have had no token of your courage, I do not suspect you of cowardice, because a coward in your situation would either fight or fly. I shall esteem myself honoured if you will permit me to cultivate your acquaintance.” “I assure you, Monsieur le General,” said Claude, “your words give strength to a resolution which almost fails; but the approbation of one like you would more than sustain me against the insults of a thousand fools. It is such as you, sir, who give morality a stamp, and prevent honest men from being put out of countenance. I am aware that slander has been busy with my name, and that I am not approved in declining a duel, although I do so in obedience to a principle which, right or wrong, I have adopted. As for other matters, I owe it to your generous confidence to assure you, that I have never been guilty of an action or a thought which should bring a blush to my cheek, and I am ready to give such explanation respecting the points in dispute as a natural curiosity may require or justice demand.” “I require no proofs,” said General St. Hillaire. “Madame Wharton has assured me that she knows you—that is enough—and I only require to see you to understand that she is right. I believe I have had the honour of exchanging cards with you before, but not of meeting you. That is a pleasure which, however, I promise myself soon again.” They were interrupted by the chambellan of the Prince —, who addressed to the general a few words, and then conducted him to his royal highness. After some moments' conversation, during which Claude could not help remarking the frank dignity of General St. Hillaire's address to the prince, and the easy and friendly familiarity with which he was received by that distinguished person, the general once more returned, and, taking Claude by the arm, led him forward, and the chambellan presented him. Although astonished at this unexpected proceeding, Claude was pleased with an opportunity of receiving such a compliment after the cold stiffness perceptible in the manner of every one else. His royal highness spoke of various subjects. His remarks were lively and affable, and Claude replied to them with a frankness which seemed to give pleasure. The interview was prolonged beyond the usual time generally allotted to similar conversations; and, when the prince bowed at the conclusion, and General St. Hillaire led him away, Claude saw a new change in the demeanour of the company. Several ventured so far as to say “Bon soir.” A gentleman “très repandu,” who had looked him full in the face several times before, without being able to see any one there, although availing himself of his glass, now came to him from across the room with, “Eh bien, mon chèr; comment ça va-t-il?” while even Thomson, with several irresistible salutations, remarked that “it was horribly hot!” a proposition innocent in itself, and so extremely true that Claude did not offer any denial.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Q 2 CHAPTER XXIII. The prince had left the room, and Claude was preparing to do the same with General St. Hillaire, whose determination to support him appeared evident to everybody. They had reached a small cabinet in which were only one or two persons, when he was not a little surprised by a bland “good-evening, Mr. Wyndham,” from the lips of Lady Beverly. This was almost the first time that lady had ever deigned to extend towards him any civility. Both he and the general stopped. He replied coolly, but politely. “Are we going to lose you?” said she, in her mildest tone. “I have heard that it is your intention to continue your tour?” “I have not made any definite decision, madam,” said Claude. “You have been quite a traveller, I believe?” Surprised at the friendly familiarity with which she spoke, and wondering what it could mean, he replied that “he had lived much abroad.” “You are an Englishman?” “Certainly, madam.” “But you have lived mostly on the Continent?” “In France.” “Paris?” “Yes, madam.” He reddened perceptibly at the pertinacity of these inquiries upon a subject on which he felt an extreme sensibility, and which he had confided to no human being in Berlin. Her questions, from which he could not retreat, appeared to possess the formality and imperativeness of a cross-examination before a legal tribunal, and several by-standers had drawn nearer and fixed their attention upon him. Among them were Elkington, Carolan, and the countess, Ida, Beaufort, and Thomson. The circle seemed to open and enclose him as she continued her interrogatories with a smile which had mischief in it. “Were you not last from London, Mr. Wyndham?” resumed Lady Beverly. “I was.” “I fear you will think me very inquisitive; but I have the pleasure of knowing some of your friends in England. Your father, I think.” “It is probable—that is—I am quite unable to say,” said Claude, with an embarrassment so obvious as to be perceived by everybody. He now saw that this singular and bad woman had a design in pursuing him, and that several of those around were probably aware of it. The Countess Carolan regarded him with a calm gravity; Carolan stood stiff and proud, with his nose in the air. General St. Hillaire looked surprised, and Lady Beverly's face was lighted with the delight of a tigress about to spring upon her prey. Ida, a little retired, bent her eyes upon him with an anguish and tenderness which sunk into his soul. She had not yet learned the art of disguising the emotions of her heart. “The Wyndhams are from Devonshire, I believe?” Claude was silent. “I think I met your father, General Wyndham. He was General Wyndham—was he not?” “No, madam—that is—he is not living—that is —that I know of.” “But your mother?” He had never so completely lost his self-possession. He was aware that these questions did not originate in mere curiosity, but were obviously put by one who knew, by whatever means, that they could not be readily answered. The surprise with which he discovered this cool and deliberate intention to pursue and injure him, and the difficulty which he had in conjecturing what could be the cause and origin of such a course, added to his dilemma. He could neither retreat, nor answer, nor decline answering, without affording the desired triumph to his malignant and mysterious enemy; and the consciousness that the eyes of all around were fixed upon him, and that even they who were most his friends regarded his hesitation with astonishment, if not suspicion, did not increase his presence of mind. He cast a glance around, and beheld each countenance expressive of their various sentiments, and his head absolutely turned dizzy when a low laugh was heard from Elkington, and Lady Beverly continued, “Pray, Mr. Wyndham, if not General Wyndham, what was your father's name? I am sure I have met him somewhere.” There was a moment's silence, and a laugh was once more heard from Elkington, while Ida's countenance showed all the anguish and sympathy of her soul. The sight of it restored him to himself, and, ashamed of his weakness, he replied calmly, “Madam, you must not be surprised if, under an examination so searching and unexpected, I have betrayed the embarrassment and distress which misfortune must ever suffer on being made the object of public attention. It was not my wish to relate to strangers the secrets of my family; but truth is better than any equivocation; and it may gratify your curiosity to learn that I am a poor orphan, thrown upon the world by a chance which I cannot explain with clearness, nor think of without pain. The name I bear was the gift of a stranger, and the face of father or mother I never saw. But, isolated as that name is from all that cheers the life of other men, it has never been allied to wrong, or sullied, madam, by dishonour!” An expression of admiration broke from the lips of several at the dignity of this reply, full of composure and conscious innocence. “Do you mean to insult my mother?” said Elkington, advancing close to him. The flashing eyes of Claude fell upon him, but did not intimidate him. St. Hillaire withdrew Claude into the corner of the cabinet. Elkington, following them, approached, and, in such a whisper as only Claude and his new friend could hear, said, “You are a scoundrel, sir!” The general frowned. Claude calmly replied, “If your own actions, my lord, proved you to possess a judgment sound enough to form just opinions, or a character pure enough to give them any importance, I should feel more regret in knowing what you think of me; as it is—” “Well,” said Elkington, his face growing red, and his whole frame trembling with a passion which he could not control, “as it is—” “I consider the terms in which they are expressed a sufficient indication of the person who utters them, and of the attention they deserve.” This short dialogue had taken place in so private a manner as to elude the observation of every one but General St. Hillaire, to change whose opinion of Claude it was probably intended; but several persons now approaching, Elkington only remarked in a low tone, and with more self-command, “At a proper time I shall request an explanation of your remark,” and withdrew. “Well, this is certainly an odd scene,” said the general. “I don't know the circumstances of the affair; but I see yonder fellow is a puppy and a blockhead, and the mother is malice itself.” Madame Wharton here came up. She was extremely agitated, and held out her hand with an emotion which might have been easily accounted for by the accident which just passed. The music and dancing were going on all the time, and the feelings which had been awakened in more than one bosom were not visible upon the surface of the glittering society.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIV. General St. Hillaire was now called from the side of Claude, and the latter, surrounded by so many prying and unfriendly eyes, was thinking of withdrawing from a scene where so little attraction awaited him, when Miss Digby complained of faintness, and Claude offered to lead her out. She desired, however, that he should conduct her into the boudoir of Madame de B—. He accordingly led her to this distant room. It was a beautiful apartment, entirely lighted with massive lamps, whose beams, falling through thick shades and screens, shed a light as soft and pale as that of the moon. In one corner was a kind of bower, half buried under vines, which crept luxuriantly over a light trellis-work, and was surrounded by large jars and vases of shrubs and flowers. The walls were hung with damask satin of dark crimson, and adorned with paintings of the best masters. The tables were piled with magnificently-bound books and engravings, writing materials, shells, pearl, portfolios, figures in bronze, ivory, and gold, of exquisite workmanship; statues of white marble stood in the corners, and leaned from pedestals and cornices. In the centre of this odour-breathing retreat, where the fresh incense of a garden and the sylvan recesses of a forest were brought, by the hand of taste, into a lady's boudoir, was a colossal vase of porcelain, from which rose a broad-leafed plant full of blossoms, of which some had fallen and lay scattered upon the thick carpet. These charming apartments—soft, shadowy, silent—are cool and delightful retreats from the glare and noise of the ballroom and the movement of the crowd. It happened that, at the moment when Claude led in his pretty young charge, no one was there. He supported her to a sofa, and would have gone immediately in search of her mother, but she grew so pale, and was so evidently about to faint, that he could not quit her. “It is the heat,” said Claude. “No, no—the dreadful scene—Lord Elkington. I fear—he is so rash—so brave—” “Lord Elkington?” “Oh, yes—he is so extremely brave—I am quite afraid—I assure you! If anything should happen to him—if you—” “Fear nothing for Lord Elkington,” said Claude, not without observing, more than usual, the weakness of this young girl's mind. “Promise me, then—promise me,” said she, “that, if you fight—you won't fire at him.” “Upon my word, I will not,” said Claude, smiling. “Oh, dear Mr. Wyndham,” said she, seizing his hand and raising it to her lips, “you give me new life. Lord Elkington is so extremely brave. Do you know he has killed two men already in a duel?” “Two men!” “Yes—he is such a very charming person. You know he would have killed papa if it had not been for—for—” “And you find that so charming!” “Oh, you know papa is so passionate—and he was so rude to him—but you won't positively hurt him?” “I have no such intention, certainly,” said Claude. “Oh, thank you,” she said again, seizing his hand once more and pressing it to her lips. “I am so much obliged to you—I shall never, never forget— Ah! some one comes.” She rose with a quickness which proved that her strength had quite returned with the dissipation of her fears for the “charming Lord Elkington,” and she disappeared in a moment. The person who had thus frightened her away was Ida. She could not help seeing Claude, and the manner in which he was engaged, as his hand was still in Mary's when she entered. At first she hastily retreated, but, on the withdrawal of Miss Digby, as if influenced by a sudden thought, she returned. Her manner was calm, but she was evidently agitated. The sight of this young girl, thus alone with him, and probably for the last time; the idea that he was soon to leave her for ever, and with an opinion which could not be other than contemptuous of his conduct and character, and the coincidence by which he had been thus discovered with Miss Digby, all threw Claude once more into an embarrassment. These new situations, he found, were too much for his composure, they came upon him so unexpectedly and in such quick succession. The return of Ida to his side when she saw he was alone, was at once so far beyond his hopes and fears, that he knew not what inference to draw from it, nor how to act. It appeared as if his guardian angel had thrown in his way an opportunity, if not to declare his sentiments, and request from the girl he so tenderly loved to abandon her brilliant but unhappy position, and tread the path of life with him, at least to bid her farewell in a manner in some degree corresponding with his anguish and his sacrifice; but the formal promise he had given Madame Wharton was not an instant absent from his memory; and with a firm effort of self-command, and a secret prayer for aid to that Power which sustains all who earnestly desire it, he determined to guard every word and look with conscientious care. For a moment both seemed at a loss how to commence the conversation, whether in the careless gayety of the ballroom, or in a tone more suitable to the thoughts which filled both their minds. At length Ida, with a dignity which surpassed all that he could imagine of what should be her demeanour on such an occasion, a modesty as of an angel suffusing her cheek with a faint colour, said, “I fear Mr. Wyndham will scarcely forgive me for the liberty of intruding into his affairs; but the scene which has just occurred—the—Lord Elkington—my father—in short, I am alarmed, you may believe, for the result.” The calmness of her manner, which almost became coldness as she finished, restored Claude in a moment to his usual composure, took from the interview the character of a tender tête-à-tête, and placed him at once in the position of a stranger—such as he might have felt himself in on a first meeting. All the audacious tenderness and wild tumult of his soul fell beneath the modest firmness of this young girl; all the idea that she had ever loved him disappeared from his mind. He stood before her, less a lover by his mistress than a subject before his queen; and, although those two hearts were so deeply touched with each other, and each felt secretly all the tender ardour of love, yet—thus alone, unwatched, under circumstances so interesting—perhaps meeting for the last time on earth, and about to separate in anger—so pure was the conscientiousness which both put into their duty, so well-disciplined and self-governed were their minds, that their demeanour towards each other was as distant and as guarded as if Madame Wharton or Count Carolan had been observing them. “If you allude to the safety of Lord Elkington—” said Claude. There was a moment's pause, which Ida did not interrupt. “I can assure you, my intentions are—” “But my object in availing myself of this chance opportunity to see you alone, was to inform you frankly what I have understood; that it is Lord Elkington's determination to offer you some farther public insult, till he drives you into a quarrel.” Vol. I.—R “And can you—” Claude began, but recollected himself. “You will not wonder that I should feel anxious for him,” said Ida. “I cannot imagine what farther insult his lordship can offer me, but a multiplication of terms which mean nothing, and but meant—” He paused again, remembering that he was speaking of her destined husband. “In these extreme cases,” continued Ida, with a slight change of colour, “I find perfect frankness the best course, and I therefore add, the happiness of all of us demands that you avoid Lord Elkington. He is so resolute, so determined. His principles on this point are so unalterable, that—” “Is it your opinion that I should fly from this persecution?” “Yes; immediately and for ever!” She spoke with eagerness. “But—” “I understand that you have expressly declined to call out Lord Elkington, as he has expected. Why subject yourself to farther annoyance? You are a stranger in Berlin. You have never been here before. You may never visit it again. My father is alienated from you by Lord Elkington, and you will leave none here whom you will ever regret or remember.” Claude's heart stood silent as if life was suspended, and a thrill ran through his whole frame. So beautiful did she look thus before him—the changing of her feelings were reflected so clearly on her transparent complexion and mobile features—the idea that she required but a word from his lips, but a glance from his eyes, to requite the deep love which he at this moment felt for her more forcibly than ever, nearly caused him to forget his resolution, and to declare to her all the agitation and tenderness of his soul. He perceived even, as Madame Wharton had stated, that she was ignorant of his love for her; that her innocence and artlessness had seen in his manner only the partiality of a friend; and that his appearance at Monsieur de B—'s with Mary Digby, and the interview in which she had found him engaged with that young lady, had completely confirmed her in the belief of what Elkington had told her respecting his intended marriage. If she was ignorant of his love, she was almost as much so of her own; and she fully believed that the interest she took in him was but the result of a natural admiration of his character—was but a true friendship, and so, perhaps, it was; for in one so pure, delicate, and modest, love itself was only friendship until the object of it should teach her its more sacred name. “Let me be your friend, Mr. Wyndham,” said she, with a faint smile; “I believe I can advise you, and, if your own happiness cannot influence you, let that of another.” “Another!” said Claude, forgetting in a moment all but the inference which, for an instant, he drew from her words. “Yes, the interesting and lovely girl, who suffers more than yourself from these painful quarrels. She nearly fainted on seeing your momentary interview just now with Lord Elkington; go, Mr. Wyndham! and believe me, your character is too well understood to suffer more than a temporary shadow from all that error or unkindness may breathe against it.” What would Claude have then given to inform her that it was for Elkington that Miss Digby had betrayed so much tender solicitude—that she was a silly girl in whom he had not the slightest interest —and that, in leaving her, he was tearing himself from peace of mind for ever. He, however, made no reply; and the music of the distant ballroom now ceasing for a moment, several persons strolled into the boudoir.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXV. On returning that night to his lodgings, Claude found a letter from Denham. By a mischance it had miscarried, it having been committed to the hand of a gentleman who, on leaving London, had intended to come directly to Berlin, but who had so altered his route as to avoid visiting that city. The letter reached Claude at last by the post from Vienna. It was in reply to the one written in the commencement of the winter, requesting information respecting Elkington. It threw a new aspect over Claude's affairs. “As for Elkington,” thus the letter proceeds, “by a peculiar chance I have been made acquainted with some circumstances concerning him which ought to be communicated to Count Carolan, and which I beg you to do on my behalf, if you are reluctant to do it on your own. You may then tell Count Carolan that, if I had a daughter, a sister, or a young female friend in the greatest destitution, I should rather see her perish from the effects of want, than to see her the wife of Lord Elkington. His father, the Earl of Beverly, will scarcely admit him into his presence, although he has but a partial knowledge of his vices. He is a desperate gambler, and there is a circumstance which happened between him, two other gentlemen, and myself, which enables me to assure you he is a cheat at cards. The cards were sealed when he left the table, and examined the next morning. It was clear, to the satisfaction of all present, that he had marked them. We taxed him with it. He was at first disposed to fight, and made several attempts; but he had to deal with cool and determined men, and he went abroad, and will probably remain there till the affair has blown over. This immunity was allowed him at the earnest entreaties of the Earl of Beverly, who was informed of the affair, and who declared to us, during an interview which we had with him on the subject, that he would disinherit him, if the estates were not entailed to descend to the eldest son. He is also deeply in debt, principally to gamblers and usurers. “There is yet another circumstance. He won the affections of a young girl, the daughter of a poor officer, and a person of the purest character and extreme loveliness. He only succeeded in obtaining her confidence by a marriage which, I assure you, was a real one, so that this interesting fellow has in reality already a wife. On learning the affair, the father called upon him, and demanded that his daughter should be publicly acknowledged. Elkington evaded him as long as he could; but the father—a high-tempered old man—demanded satisfaction, although his friends advised him to pursue legal measures. Elkington met him, and at the first shot the unhappy father fell. The daughter lost her senses, and is now in a madhouse, where it is probable she will not long survive. They had no money, no friends; and the affair is hushed up, no other notice being taken of it than the usual flippant announcement in the newspaper, that `an affair of honour had taken place yesterday morning between Lord Elkington and Captain Atwood, which, unfortunately, had a fatal termination; the ball of his lordship, at the first fire, passing through his opponent's head. We learn that the quarrel originated in some attentions which his lordship had paid to a young lady, a near relative of the deceased. It is said that his lordship went reluctantly into the field, and behaved with great coolness; and that he felt the deepest regret that the choleric rashness of his former friend rendered such a course inevitable. His lordship, it is said, has started on a tour to the Continent.' “You may tell your friend Count Carolan these R 2 circumstances, and he may give my name, if he pleases, to Elkington, who knows well I do not fear him, and that I have but to open my lips to blast his name. This I would not do, except in a circumstance like that you have informed me of; and where he is about to marry into a family so distinguished and so little acquainted with him, I readily consent to put them on their guard. “And now, having disposed of the profligate of whom you inquire, let me add a few words respecting myself. Since you left London I have become a married man. You know the young lady; she has no rank nor fortune, but she is all beauty and sweetness, and looks up to me with respect and gratitude, as well as affection. She has nothing on earth. Her father is a poor clergyman—one of the best and most delightful of men. He has given her a perfect education. You know I have no property but the life annuity bequeathed to me by my eccentric uncle, who hated the marriage state so much, because he happened to be afflicted with a bad wife himself, that he wished, by this manner of bequeathing his fortune, to discourage me from forming any matrimonial alliance. I am worth, therefore, £1000 a year till the day of my death, when my beloved wife, and whatever family Providence may bless us with, will be left with only the amount of savings which we can put by from our current expenses. Notwithstanding these inducements to economy, we are coming abroad in the spring, and we mean to take Berlin in our way.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVI. Claude read with various emotions this account of Elkington's character, and the more so, as it coincided with the estimation he had formed of him. Yet he could not, under the circumstances which he found himself, reveal it to Carolan without subjecting himself to the imputation of an interested motive. Perhaps it would be deemed a mere slander upon a successful rival, who had openly insulted him, and whom he dared not meet in the field. Madame Wharton rose to his memory; but sending the letter to her would be in fact the same as sending it to the count. What if he gave it to Ida? But the objections to this at once presented themselves. With what propriety could he secretly dissuade the daughter from marrying a man selected by her family—even did he, in the eyes of that family, stand himself less in the attitude of a rejected lover? What if he should not interfere at all in the matter? There seemed an indelicacy in any interference; and Count Carolan was not a man of sense, but of prejudices so fixed and conceit so strong, that it was not certain he would listen to any proof, and perhaps he would insult him who should presume to offer any. Yet with what propriety could he, from a false idea of delicacy, keep concealed a secret which affected the happiness of Ida, and which might materially change the intentions of her family? Would it not, in fact, be a favour to any one thus situated, to inform them of circumstances so well authenticated, and in which they were so much interested? Would it not look even as cowardly to withhold, as it might appear base to reveal it? He thought of an anonymous letter, but his manly frankness instantly rejected the idea. Anonymous writers rarely receive attention, and still more rarely deserve it. A middle course presented itself, viz., to enclose the letter to Count Carolan, with permission, if he pleased, to state to Lord Elkington who had communicated the facts in question. He instantly addressed the following note to Carolan: “Monsieur le Comte: “I am on the eve of leaving Berlin, where I shall probably never return again. It is possible that you may misinterpret the motives with which I send you the enclosed letter. I received it from a person of trust, and can vouch for its truth. Mr. Denham, as you will perceive, offers his name also; but I beg you to withhold it from Lord Elkington, as I am willing, should there be any serious responsibility, to take it upon myself. My sole object is to put you in possession of facts which affect the interests of your family. You are at liberty to state that you received them from me; for, while I have nothing to hope from your decision, I have nothing to fear from Lord Elkington's resentment. If any passing weakness has ever caused me to seem to swerve from the path which I ought to pursue in relation to yourself and everything connected with you, that weakness is at an end. If I have ceased, as with pain I perceive I have, to receive your esteem, I hope I have not ceased to deserve it. “I am, etc., etc.” He sealed and instantly despatched this note by Carl, telling him to deliver it to Count Carolan, and only into his own hand. It was now late at night. He was too much excited by the circumstances of the evening to sleep. Indeed, he felt a sense of heated and painful wakefulness. He then opened the window. It was a calm and pleasant night, and he determined to walk forth to indulge in the reflections to which his singular position gave rise. “I will quit this place,” he thought, as he wandered slowly up the Linden towards the Brandenburg gate. “I will quit this spot for ever. It has been fatal to my peace—almost to my honour. I will wait the answer of this letter to Carolan, and then turn my back on this proud portal—on these thoughtless crowds—who believe so readily slander from the lips of a scoundrel—and who look coldly on a man because he refuses to shed his fellow-creature's blood, or to pour out his own at the call of every rash fool or designing villain. I am what I am.” The evening seemed to grow softer and brighter as he advanced. The sky had at first been dashed over with small white clouds disposed in airy waves, a sea rippled by a summer breeze, through which the moon steadily and peacefully held her course, even as an unswerving and patient mind pursues the path appointed by Heaven. As he walked on, these fleecy shapes broke silently apart, gentle as thought, and, like it, mingling and separating with a noiseless motion, till, dissolved into torn fragments, like the vanishing doubts of a pure and settled mind, they at length disappeared entirely, and left the void all stainless and still—its fathomless extent glittering with those wonderful systems which God has hung before our eyes—a revelation of his immensity, benevolence, and power. “It is virtue,” thought he; “it is truth. What an emblem! what a lesson! God spreads it above our heads to teach us to look up! to raise our eyes from the earth, whose magnificence and grandeur are so infinitely surpassed, that we may daily view it and nightly study it. It shadows forth not only what he is, but what we may be, trusting to him, and lifting our eyes above the earth!” These and similar contemplations tranquillized his soul, and seemed to establish between him and his Maker a kind of communion, which made his approbation far more necessary than all the uncertain and useless applause of the world; useless, at least, unless bestowed upon what is right. He wandered on and on, till he presently found himself before the palace of Count Carolan. He paused to look on it thus in the silence of night. The moonbeams fell across its yellow and richly-sculptured façade, and tall, closed windows, leaving one of its heavy wings in the shadow, and glancing across the overhanging buttresses, and the company of statues which stood speechless and stirless upon its eaves and in the court. There is something in a noble edifice which seems touched with human sympathy, and partakes of the character of those who erect and those who inhabit it. Architecture is so full of mind and grandeur, that those stately colonnades and slender columns speak to the soul almost with a language. Claude gazed upon the rooms which he had so often seen blazing with light and animated with gay crowds, upon the silent pavé so often thronged with glittering carriages and trampling horses—now all gone. “So anon,” thought the solitary muser, “will fade from the green earth all that inhabit it, into shadows—into memories of the past.” Beneath that roof slept Ida. It was possible he might never see her again. “Farewell,” he said, “lovely and ever beloved. Thou sleepest! Sleep on! Hover over her, ye guardian angels! Shield her from every care! Lead her light step over a summer path. Spring every flower to her beautiful feet. If pain threaten her, send it instead to my heart. Let never that young smile be shaded by a thought of me; and the misery she has inflicted, oh! may she never share—may she never even know!” In the weakness of the moment, it seemed to him as if he were taking that farewell which he dare not do in reality, and as if this solitary moment were rendered more sacred by a parting which was to separate them for ever. He walked on. His steps were bent almost unconsciously towards the Park; and, passing the Brandenburg gate, its stately form lifted against the glittering heavens, and the magnificent group on its top showing in that soft light as if some goddess had descended, indeed, upon earth, in her airy car, down that star-paved road. The wood looked lonely and beautiful at that “dead waist and middle of the night;” some parts lying clear and white in the moonlight, and some leading the eye into deep recesses and deserted glades, steeped in black shadows. He entered this lonely spot, which had been the scene of his rash hopes, and which was now the mute witness of his despair. Claude was one of those strongly acted upon by the various aspects of nature. It was not necessary for him to seek Alpine cliffs, Italian shores, and distant deserts, to thrill beneath the beauty and power which, to those formed to be touched by these divine mysteries, lie ever around, above their heads, and beneath their feet. Where the common mind wanders unstirred, beholding only common things, his finer spirit saw God's footstep and the writing of his hand; and he entered this perfectly-abandoned forest, with its heavy piles of foliage and shadows— its dark aisles—its grassy and flower-enamelled floor —its arched and leafy vaults, and its utterly hushed recesses, with a feeling of solemn delight and awe, which made him move slowly, as over enchanted ground. The trees, as they stood grouped around, to his aroused imagination half seemed a company of unearthly beings, communing with each other in a wordless language, and reaching forth to the earth and to the stars their ancient and appealing arms. “Who knows,” thought our ever-musing wanderer, “but that the spirit of consciousness, which lies in so many forms—which God has shed into matter in such various ways, may lurk in these dim shapes— may flow through their twisted and gently moving limbs—may warm their aged hearts, and sparkle in their outbursting buds and leaves! Why should not the tree feel the breeze that wakes its branches— the tempest that threatens to tear up its `earth-bound roots?' Who knows but they are spirits watching the ways of men—bending with pity over the pining lover—calmly watching the conqueror's car—shading the boy at his happy and fleeting sports—or, when life is done, waving over his grave, and knowing more of earth and its mysteries than we its masters? Who can pretend to possess the deep secrets that lie around us?” There came over his memory recollections of his youthful hours, when it had been his delight to climb into the branches. Ah! they then brought to his careless mind no such dim and fearful thoughts! His heart then saw in the earth around him only the bright colours of happiness and hope; and the wondrous objects now startling him with mysterious meaning and with strange beauty, but half seen before, struck his delighted eye, without printing themselves so solemnly on his soul. As he proceeded, he came to a spot, the surpassing beauty of which caused him again to pause. A narrow path wound close to the edge of a stream, which here, spreading out into a pretty lake, lay, a moveless sheet of silver light, in which the surrounding objects discovered themselves with perfect distinctness. Behind him was a mass of thick shrubbery. A small bridge crossed the water, and a few seats, now deserted, had been placed around for the convenience of pedestrians. The full moon, riding in her meridian splendour, poured a flood of light upon the scene, reflecting the thick wall of foliage which rose by the water, and leaving the interior recesses in the blackest shadow. Immediately by his side a white-barked tree leaned over the flood, in such a way that the moonbeams, glancing from its white bark, rendered it as brightly visible as a column of silver. Claude stopped beside this tree to admire a night-scene, which, in its soft and simple beauty, seemed disposed for the study of a painter. He leaned over and gazed into the water. A part of the adjoining wood rose tall and clear in that inverted world—each delicate fibre and finely pencilled leaf drawn in lines of soft light—the bridge hung beneath with wondrous beauty, every bending arch and slender line strangely distinct. There lay the shores leaning back from the edge—there hung the budding foliage and silent flowers, as soft as light itself. There rose the tall trunks glimmering in the radiant air—the tree beside which he stood—his own form and features—and yet deeper, beyond imagination, to infinity, were the blue and bending heavens—the glittering stars—the sleeping clouds— the spotted moon. “Exquisite! incredible!” broke from his lips. He almost held his breath as he gazed, a sense of unutterable delight filling his heart; when, with a thrill that froze his blood, he saw beneath him, in the starless mirror, a hand—and a dagger glittering in the moonbeams, raised aloft to strike. He had only time to commit himself to God, when a loud shriek rose close behind him, like a voice awaken ing one struggling with the nightmare. He was instantly drawn back, and staggered against the tree, the reflection of which a few moments before he had been observing in the water. It was a moment ere he quite recovered from the stupor into which this incident had thrown him. On turning, he found himself alone, but the figure of a female at some distance appeared approaching him. As he advanced towards her, he perceived she was breathless and fainting with terror. She sunk upon one of the seats, and, lifting her face, pale with fright, discovered the features of Madame Wharton. “Thank God!” she exclaimed, as soon as her agitation would permit her to speak. “Oh, let us hasten from this dreadful spot.” “Madame Wharton!” said Claude, “I am amazed. How came you here—at this extraordinary hour—at a moment so strange?—and where is he who attempted my life?” “Oh, Mr. Wyndham! what a singular chance!” “It was your shriek that saved me. I had lost my balance.” Vol. I.—S “Merciful Providence! Let us hasten away and call the guard,” said Madame Wharton. “But, madame—you—how came you here?—by what extraordinary chance?—I am quite at a loss to conjecture!” “I will tell you as we proceed; but, for Heaven's sake, do not delay your return. I am painfully alarmed—this is shocking.” “It might have been much worse though,” said Claude, smiling. “But the ruffian may return—” “Pray be under no apprehension. If he does, I will be more ready for him. He would not fire a pistol so near the town, and with a dagger he cannot do much harm when seen; but I have no words to express my amazement. What can this mean? Whom have I offended? What ill have I done to call for such vengeance? I have never had a serious quarrel except with one person; and, much as I despise that person, I really dare not utter his name in connexion with such an affair.” “It is mysterious—it is frightful,” said Madame Wharton; “but let us hasten towards the gate. I tremble lest the assassin should return. We must give notice to the guard.” “No,” said Claude; “the man by this time is probably long past pursuit, and most likely has entered by some other gate. He would scarcely undertake an affair like this without being prepared for a retreat.” “Had he succeeded, you would have been precipitated into the water. It might have been months—perhaps years—before your fate could be known.” “But pray satisfy my curiosity,” said Claude, “for I scarcely find this attempt on my life so extraordinary as your being here so opportunely to save me—and at such an unseasonable hour!” “I went to your hotel,” said Madame Wharton. “I had something of importance to inquire of you. I could not come before, and my impatience would not permit me to wait till to-morrow: wishing to see you in secret, I took with me no servant, and I had no idea that I should be less safe about the town in the night than in the day. On inquiring at your hotel, they told me you had gone out. I returned home and was entering the house, when I thought I perceived you at a distance, walking towards the Park. The extreme loveliness of the night seemed to render this place peculiarly appropriate as the scene for the conversation I wished to have with you, and I followed you. On drawing near, I perceived a figure on the shady side of the way moving at some distance behind you, with an air of one watching you—pausing when you paused—advancing when you advanced—stooping and lurking back in the shadow, and hiding behind the nearest object twice when you turned. This strange apparition, dogging your steps with such a stealthy determination, awakened first my curiosity and then my alarm. He skulked after you till you approached and passed through the gate; then pausing a considerable time, he assumed a careless air, and went also through the portal. I followed. For a long time, as you walked, I perceived him skulking after you till you approached the dark grove which ended by the stream. He then hid behind a tree. The moonlight streamed upon the spot where you stood, and, as you leaned over the water, I saw him steal cautiously up. I should have called, but even then I was not sure he might not be one of your acquaintance, practising some merry surprise; till, with a terror which for a moment took from me the power of speech, I saw him dart from the thicket to your side, and something in his hand flashed in the moonlight as he lifted it over your head. My horror scarcely enabled me to utter the shriek which arrested him; when, starting and muttering a deep oath in English, he passed very near me with great rapidity, and disappeared.” “Did you see his face?” “I did not.” “And could you at all recognise his form?” “No. Terror blinded me. I have no distinct impression of his appearance.” “It is certainly very singular—and recalls to me an incident which happened soon after my arrival in Berlin. I was walking also late at night, as I have a custom of doing, and also in the Park, when a strange, coarse-looking man presented himself suddenly at my back as I turned accidentally on hearing the howl of a dog.” “You are, then, the object of an assassin's dagger; you are certainly marked for some one's victim.” “But whose?” “Alas!” said Claude, with emotion, “I know not. I scarcely care. My life is full of mystery and pain. I have nothing which cheers the existence of other men.” “But,” said Madame Wharton, “we are nearly at the gate; and, before we proceed, let me ask you some information respecting your family and situation. A wonderful coincidence has brought you before my eyes; and with you, Mr. Wyndham, such singular associations and vague hopes as make me tremble.” “Associations—with me?” echoed Claude. “I heard your replies this evening,” continued Madame Wharton, “to that odious Lady Beverly. Who this woman is I do not know. But I perceive she has conceived an enmity against you which excites my curiosity. Let me be indeed your friend. Confide in me your whole history. You are strangely misrepresented here now. You stand in the attitude of a suspected person. Very painful statements are going the rounds of the whole society concerning you. Elkington openly avows that you are an impostor and a coward, and has deliberately expressed his determination to drive you from Berlin in disgrace. Count Carolan believes him. He says you are here under an assumed name. Your attachment to Ida is beginning to be talked of, and Carolan has declared that you shall never again enter his house. He has solemnly forbidden Ida even to speak to or of you, under the pain of his lasting displeasure; and he is capable of turning her adrift upon the world for the slightest act of disobedience. What is the origin of these reports?” “If to be nameless and friendless—if to be without family or resources, except one which chance has given and may withdraw at any moment—if to have loved rashly one whom I knew I could never obtain—and if to feel myself bound by principles of action from which not disgrace itself shall make me swerve, against calling out into the field, and killing or being killed, by the man who makes no secret of his wish to ruin me; if this be guilt, then I am most guilty. If this be cowardice, then I am a coward.” “Who are you, then?” said Madame Wharton, with increasing agitation. “You are ill,” said Claude; “you are exhausted with the terror of this night.” “No. I earnestly entreat you to go on.” “Then, madame, I fear that I am the child of guilt; and I fear that, if I had a family, I should be more degraded than I am without one. I remember little of my infancy. It passed among strangers. I crossed the ocean in my earliest years to England, where I was placed at a good school, and where subsequently I received an education which I owed to charity. Lord Perceval, the friend I have lately lost, and his estimable lady, some time since deceased, brought me up out of friendship. On leaving the university I received a letter which could only have proceeded from a heart filled with loathing, and directed against one whose existence S 2 it regarded as a misfortune and a shame. It informed me that I was the child of guilt; that only one person on the earth knew who I was, and that person was and ever would be prevented by disgust and horror from owning or seeing me; that I sprung from the lowest, the vilest class of society; that my father was a wretch covered with dishonour, and my mother a—being yet lower; that she had paid the penalty of her crimes—and that, if ever I made an attempt to discover my origin, I should but bring down on my head all the detestation and shame which criminal parents could bequeath to a miserable child. An annuity of £450 was settled on me through a certain banker, on the condition that I should never take measures to find out from whence it came, or anything concerning it. It was to cease instantly upon the first inquiry. I was requested to pass most of my time abroad. I have been compelled thus to live a kind of idle life. I have travelled about the globe, and occupied myself with my own thoughts and observations, and endeavoured to find a recompense for these disadvantages, and to repair, as far as possible, by a stainless life, the woes and guilt of those mysterious persons from whom I drew my being.” “Have you that letter?” “It is among the papers of Lord Perceval. I have long made up my mind to pursue the subject no farther. A father who could thus cast me off, and doom me to a life of suspicion—to be branded by every malicious foe with mysteries which I cannot explain—I confess I would not meet if I could, and I should tremble lest, in discovering him, I should but find some unfortunate whose hands are imbrued with blood and crime, and the spoils of whose sin I myself am perhaps sharing. My curiosity to unravel these secrets—to know what sin my mother has committed, and what was the manner in which she expiated it—this curiosity is quenched by the misgivings to which it gives rise. Oh, my mother! if your shade hovers in the air, or pines in hopeless wo for a life of crime, cannot the sacrifices of your unhappy son soften your anguish or sooth your remorse? And oh, my father! if your dark eyes follow the course of him whom you have thus so long cast off, are there no moments when nature pleads in a heart hardened only by chance, and you behold through tears of affection one who obeys and loves, even when he trembles at the thought of you?” “Have you no knowledge of your real name?” “None. A complete mystery enshrouds it. Often, when I read of the execution of some female, I shudder lest it might be the being who gave me birth; often, when I hear of some criminal, I wonder whether a father's heart be not bursting in that death-doomed form.” “Horrible thought!” said Madame Wharton. “I am encircled by awful mysteries,” said Claude. “I feel as if borne by destiny along a dark tide, I know not whither.” “It is dark indeed,” said Madame Wharton. “I am as bewildered as yourself. There are strange things in life—and wild—which sometimes hover around the paths of mortals—and which are never dreamed of by others.” “But come,” said Claude, “I have been excited and weak. I do not allow myself often to give way to these thoughts. Perhaps my imaginations and apprehensions are equally unfounded. There is a bright side as well as a dark to my fate; but will you allow me to ask, madame, what object you have in pursuing these inquiries?” “Because I am your friend,” said Madame Wharton, in a low and tremulous tone; and she held out her hand. He pressed it to his lips. “You are,” said he, “the only one on earth who takes an interest in my lonely fate, and I thank you.” “Promise me, then,” said Madame Wharton, “to be guided by me. Do not yield to the temptations which Elkington will throw in the way of your passion, and to Ida—be as a stranger. The path of right is sometimes steep and dreary, but leads to true happiness.” “I have promised,” said Claude. He felt that he yielded to her influence as a mortal to a superior being, sent thus by Heaven to save his life in the moment of peril, and to support his resolution with the inspired words of hope and virtue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Monsieur le Comte: “I am on the eve of leaving Berlin, where I shall probably never return again. It is possible that you may misinterpret the motives with which I send you the enclosed letter. I received it from a person of trust, and can vouch for its truth. Mr. Denham, as you will perceive, offers his name also; but I beg you to withhold it from Lord Elkington, as I am willing, should there be any serious responsibility, to take it upon myself. My sole object is to put you in possession of facts which affect the interests of your family. You are at liberty to state that you received them from me; for, while I have nothing to hope from your decision, I have nothing to fear from Lord Elkington's resentment. If any passing weakness has ever caused me to seem to swerve from the path which I ought to pursue in relation to yourself and everything connected with you, that weakness is at an end. If I have ceased, as with pain I perceive I have, to receive your esteem, I hope I have not ceased to deserve it. “I am, etc., etc.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVII. Lady Beverly and Elkington drove home from the ball at Mr. de B—'s in no very amiable mood. The inquiries which Lady Beverly had so pertinaciously put to Claude respecting his family, had been the result of a settled plan to embarrass and disgrace him, and it perfectly well succeeded till his last reply, which, with the dignity of truth, turned the tables against them, carried conviction to every heart, and rather created sympathy than the distrust and derision intended. In proportion to their disappointment at their failure, their detestation increased. On reaching the hotel after the ball, instead of retiring to bed, they sat up, engaged in a conversation upon the state of their affairs, in which Claude now began to play an important rôle. “If ever two young fools on earth loved each other,” said Lady Beverly, “they are mutually in love. They both conceal it as far as they can; but, in my opinion, they privately understand each other, and have already formed a plan to break off your engagement. Is it likely that they should be together so much as they have been, with such feelings as they evidently entertain for each other, without a mutual explanation?” “If I can drive on this affair with Carolan,” said Elkington, “I shall have something to stand on till the old man dies. I can keep Shooter quiet, and arrange my other affairs till the event, which cannot be far off, comes to relieve me. At the moment of success, this detested coward steps between me and my hopes. He slights and insult me with every look. Before Ida knew him she was quite decided. She would have married me at any moment. But now she's shy—cool—timid. I find her sometimes abstracted and melancholy — sometimes in tears—and lately she has even frowned in a way which I don't like. I'll marry her, whether she will or not; that is in my power. She shall be my wife if it break her heart; and if I could but blow this scoundrel's brains out, and marry her afterward, I would hasten back to London, pay my debts, hush up those two cursed affairs, and in future conduct operations a little more cautiously. As for this Wyndham, he needn't think to escape me. I have lived two-and-twenty years in the world, and very possibly I have overlooked a favour, but, by —, I never forget an injury or an insult.” “But this man won't fight.” “Won't?” said Elkington, starting from his seat, and pacing the room with a hurried step. “He can't avoid it. I'll make him. No man, be his principles what they may, can escape it. Won't fight? I have heard of this before; but I never yet found the person whom, when I chose, I could not force to it, and whom, when once there, I could not teach the danger of crossing me with impunity. Claude Wyndham has insulted, injured, and thwarted me. I am not to be trampled on with impunity, nor am I one of those who shrink from availing themselves of means which every gentleman sanctions and adopts.” “But human life—my son,” said Lady Beverly, “have you not already too much stained your hands?” “No. It is a prejudice. What is human life more than other life? It was made to be extinguished by a thousand chances. Men are but insects, who are born by millions—who come and go like gnats in the breeze. They perish in the field of battle—in the wreck—by famine—by pestilence, and their own excesses. They are like the reptiles which lie across our path as we walk; we cannot help treading on them. What avails one more or less? Yet these cautious cowards would have us believe that earth and heaven are moved when a miserable creature like this Wyndham is turned into his grave a few years before his time.” “But your own life, my son.” “I care not for my own life. What is life to me, that I should value, or death, that I should fear it? My youth is past, and with it all my hopes of pleasure. I have quaffed the cup till sated with its cloying sweets. What, after all, has life to offer me but a few enjoyments; startling, because full of danger; or sweet, only to sicken me the sooner? I confess, on this miserable earth I find no great attraction. Every real pleasure is forbidden by law, by society, or by the narrow limits of our own natures. We can't enjoy as we would. Internal diseases follow every feast which is spread before the eyes of poor mortals; and, as if the world had been created by a fiend, a youth of pleasure is sure to be followed by an age of pain. Already I begin to feel the effects of plucking the fruit that hangs around me, and of drinking the stream which flows at my feet. Yet what is it there for, if not for us? No. If I don't value the lives of others, neither do I my own. I have nothing to regret—nothing to regret me. When I die, it will be but the falling off of a leaf unmourned, unmissed. If I have nothing to regret in life, neither have I anything to fear in death. I believe in no hereafter!” “Alas! who can tell?” said Lady Beverly. “I can, madam, My common sense tells me that this is an idle dream—a folly of the nursery— a tale of priests and poets—an impossibility. What! live without life? be crushed by a piece of granite, like a trodden fly, and yet exist, and breathe, and see, and move? bah! It is ridiculous. It is a lie. When we die, we die. Things to us are ended. The spider that we tread on, and the man we kill— once gone, are gone. It is all black—blank—void —and who cares? What difference does it make whether he or I go a day or two sooner or later? Who watches over us—our fates—our actions? Who will care if I kill him, or he me? Who sees —who knows—who takes note of all the multifarious incidents of mankind, age after age? No, no— thank God!—if life has few charms for me, death has fewer terrors. It is but a bullet—a flash—a leap—and then—a sound sleep. The rest is a bugbear!” A knock at the door interrupted him, and Scarlet entered with a letter, which, he said, had been left by a person enveloped in a cloak, so that his face could not be seen. Elkington took the letter, dismissed the servant, broke the seal, and read. “For God sake, Edward, what is it?” said Lady Beverly, as she watched his countenance. He made no reply till he had finished perusing it; then he struck his hand violently upon the table and said, “It only wanted this. I'll tread that man beneath my heel like an adder.” “Edward, what does this mean?” “Read, and tell me whether this is not enough to sanction any step?” She read aloud. It was Claude's letter to Count Carolan, enclosing that from Denham. The two had been sent by another hand in a third envelope. “I will silence him,” said Elkington. “But how?” “He must meet me before another day is passed.” “He will not.” “He shall; he must be made to. I'll insult him. I'll choose the most public scene to heap on him all the odium he merits. I'll insult every lady who walks with him. There is no provocation which one man can offer another which I will not thrust upon him. I'll ring in his ears, and in the ears of all around him, that he is a coward and a villain. I'll brand him aloud with every epithet of scorn.” “Edward! Edward!” said Lady Beverly, following him backward and forward through the room. “And if,” said he, “he refuses to fight, I'll—” The door was suddenly thrown open, and Scarlet announced “Mr. Wyndham.” “Mr. Wyndham?” cried Lady Beverly, with astonishment. “It is certainly some mistake. Mr. Wyndham?” “You are a fool,” said Elkington. “Who is it? what is it?” “It is Mr. Wyndham, my lord, with another person.” “Great Heaven!” exclaimed Lady Beverly, “what can this mean?” “Admit them!” said Elkington, sternly, and with a feeling at his heart which even he, wide as had been his experience in human sensations, had never known before. At the word of the servant Claude entered, dragging in with an iron grasp an individual who, although he resisted, seemed scarcely to require an effort of his athletic arm. Thrust into the middle of the floor, he lifted a pale countenance, so much altered that he was with difficulty recognised as the complaisant and even amiable Carl. Claude advanced to the table where Lady Beverly and Elkington had been sitting. He was calm, and even courteous in his demeanour, but his face, as eminently formed to express sternness as gentleness, exhibited determination which, for a minute, awed both the persons whose midnight privacy he had so unexpectedly and unceremoniously interrupted. Lady Beverly leaned for support upon the table. Elkington stood half stupified with indignation, yet, for the moment, too thunderstruck to speak, but his eyes glittered with a passion more terrible from its stillness. “I might offer an apology to Lady Beverly,” said Claude, “for this abrupt and unseasonable visit, but the occasion must be its own excuse.” “Speak on, sir,” said Lady Beverly, for Elkington seemed speechless with astonishment and rage. “Passing accidentally your door but this instant, I saw my servant approach it, muffled in a cloak— hand a letter—and hastily retreat with signs of guilty caution. I followed and seized him as he was creeping stealthily back to his home. I demanded whom he had been to see—what employment he was charged with from other persons than myself— whom else he served—what letter he had delivered —and why this air of guilty secrecy. The boy is a coward as well as a scoundrel, and, terrified at being detected, he instantly made a confession so singularly involving the honour of yourself, madam, and Lord Elkington, that, as much from respect to you as from justice to myself, I determined that you should confront him on the instant and convict him of the falsehood.” “This insult—this outrage,” cried Lady Beverly. “D—tion, sir!” said Elkington, reaching from a bookcase at his side a pair of duelling pistols, and laying them with a quaking hand and an ashy face upon the table, “if you are not a scoundrel—” “Repeat, sir,” said Claude to Carl, “what you have just confessed to me.” “I confess—” said Carl, in excellent English. Vol. I.—T “How!” said Claude. “Do you speak English?” “Yes, monsieur; pardon me—forgive me—do not put me in prison. I will relate all, indeed, indeed I will—” “If you utter one word, you cowardly rascal, respecting me or my affairs, I'll send this bullet through your head,” said Elkington. “Oh, mon Dieu!” said Carl, whining and crying, “what shall I do, what shall I do?” “He declares that for some time past he has been in your pay; that you have promised to take him with you to England in your employ; that he has rendered you an account of my actions— conversations—journals—and private letters and papers—” “He is an infamous liar!” said Elkington, “and you are the same; and I will so proclaim you in public wherever I meet you.” “Your language, my lord, convinces me that, however vile may be my servant, he has employers yet more so.” “Coward! you shall give me satisfaction for this; you shall hear from me before you sleep, and in a way which, if you are not dead to every feeling of honour—” “Of my honour, my lord,” said Claude, “I am the guardian, and I believe you are not the judge.” “Then I brand the words coward and liar upon your forehead. I will thunder them in your ear— I will write them beneath your name in all companies, at all hours—I will never meet you in the streets, in the ball, in the church even, without pointing, and hissing, and proclaiming aloud, There stands a coward!” “If you can point your finger,” said Claude, with perfect composure, “at one action of my life which dishonours me, I shall feel annoyed by the terms you make use of. Otherwise they pass by me `as the idle wind,' and I shall avoid you as a madman, or take measures to secure myself against you as a ruffian. The words of a man like you can neither awake my passion nor permanently injure my character. As for the charge I make against you, I wish I could believe it untrue.” “It is untrue, I solemnly declare,” said Lady Beverly. “And I so pronounce it, on the faith of a gentleman and a man of honour,” said Elkington; “and let any one but an outcast like yourself, deny, nay, doubt it, at his peril. The good name of a nobleman and a lady are not to be destroyed by the raving of a valet-de-chambre, nor the malignant plots of a miserable impostor, without rank, fortune, or family; a child of guilt and chance, whose father is probably in a convict's cell—whose mother—” Claude laid his hand on the pistol nearest him, and Elkington, with a sneer of triumph and hate, grasped his, and continued, “Whose mother, after a life of pollution, has died, amid hisses and jeers, on the scaffold.” It was obvious that this coarse language was the mode by which Elkington hoped to taunt and lash his foe to desperation; for he knew in his heart that he was no coward, and that he had only to give passion one moment an ascendancy over that calm reason and high principle which inspired his life, and shed a kind of divine protection around him, to push him into a duel, and quench the hate which had now taken possession of his soul to a fearful extent. It is not certain that Claude, thus goaded beyond example and almost beyond bearing, might not have consented to arrangements for an immediate meeting; but he remembered his promise given to Madame Wharton, and laid down the deadly weapon. At the same moment he perceived something which again reminded him that he was dealing with a man beneath his notice. “You deny, then, that you have had any private communication with my servant?” asked Claude. “Most positively,” said Elkington, “and I pronounce him—” “Spare your invectives, my lord,” said Claude. “That he who could be base enough to do such a thing, would be mean enough to deny it, does not surprise me; but I am astonished that such a skilful practitioner as Lord Elkington should make the denial without at least first dropping from his hand the evidence of his guilt.” Elkington looked down, and beheld the letter which Claude had written to Carolan, and which, in his confusion, he had retained in his hand. It was open, and the signature, “Claude Wyndham,” was conspicuously visible. The letter from Denham was also lying open on the table. “You will excuse my resuming my own property,” said Claude, reaching forward and taking the two letters. Elkington's eyes absolutely flashed with fury as Claude moved to take the letter from his hand, and he cocked the pistol and raised it, his face whitening with his dreadful purpose. But the act of deliberately shooting an unarmed man, of sending headlong into eternity the human being who stands erect before him, in all the loveliness of life, requires a nerve which can scarcely be the gift but of madness, and which even this reckless villain had not yet become sufficiently frantic to acquire. Besides, there are consequences. The law is awakened when such a deed is openly done. There is no hushing it up; and a vision of a dungeon and a crowded court—of a felon's chain and a felon's fate— formed a restraint upon the hand of Elkington which neither generosity nor religion would have excited. He muttered in a voice choked and husky with rage, “Wyndham, you shall hear from me to-morrow. You shall not carry it off in this manner.” “No, my lord, your message will be useless. You may murder me if you will, and take the consequences. My life, like that of every other man, is exposed to the attempt of an assassin. Your threats I despise—your calumnies I defy. A peaceful conscience will secure me from the one, and a pure life from the other. For my courage, my lord, you may think and speak of it as you please; but I shall expose your baseness without hesitation or fear, and perhaps call upon the law of our common country to protect me against the falsehood of so unprincipled a slanderer. Should you dare to direct against an unarmed man the blind fury of an assassin, I leave those laws to punish you as a murderer merits.” “Cautious coward!” said Elkington, and again raised his arm. The demon in his soul whispered him to fire, and thus plunge with so mortal an enemy down the chasm of death. It is possible that, had his foe shown any symptom of fear or retreat, he might so far have lost his reason as to have accomplished his dark intention; but Claude was a man of strong nerve as well as of perfect courage, and he really feared death as little and much less than his rival. To him life was now bereft of its charm, and perhaps secretly he was scarce displeased at the thought of a sudden blow, which would terminate an existence doomed to such sad despair. This real indifference to death shed around him a calm grandeur. He stood firm and cool—the very smile on his lips unchanged—and the sternness of his brow softening into something of derision and contempt, while his clear, searching eye bent on his antagonist a gaze that pierced and cowed his soul; and his unprotected breast lay so unshrinkingly open to the blow, that, in addition to the idea of a gibbet, a sentiment of shame touched the villain's heart and caused him to lower his weapon. Lady Beverly, after an ineffectual attempt to arrest his arm, fell back fainting on the sofa. T 2 “We shall meet again,” said Elkington. “There will be a time!” Claude withdrew without haste. Again he found himself alone in the cool, silent night. His eye was cast again over the tranquil streets and up to the starry sky. One motion of Elkington's finger, and he would have never gazed on these fair objects more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVIII. It is often observed that events of peculiar interest come crowding upon us together. The man who has inherited a rich legacy is not unlikely to draw a prize in the lottery, or he who has just lost a ship at sea, to have his house burned down at about the same period. One might almost be tempted to think that superior beings wove, in a kind of sport, the destinies of mortals; conscious, perhaps, that hereafter the objects of their amusement will be raised so far above their present condition as to join in the merriment which all that belongs merely to earth is alone worthy to excite. Elkington, after pacing his room all night in a state which precluded the possibility of sleep, sent early the next morning for a gentleman whom he knew he might trust with the commission he intended to ask of him. This was a retired French officer, who, like himself, was a duellist in principle and by profession, having in his time sent to a bloody grave several persons who had inadvertently trodden on his toe, occupied his seat at the opera, looked at his female companions, or committed some other heinous offences, without offering in reparation exactly the kind of apology which he thought becoming. He was a fierce-looking little man, with an ugly face and a still more disagreeable person. He had no qualities which rendered him pleasing. He did not pay his debts, nor serve his friends with fidelity, unless when he thought his interest required him to do so. Nobody really liked him. But he was invited everywhere. He was a brave man, and had performed some gallant feats in action; but, having been shot through the body in one duel with a brother officer, because he would not disown an expression which he afterward confessed he had never used, and having received a cut across the cheek in another, from a person who said he was an ass, and who, upon being called upon to retract, declared himself ready to abide by what he had said, and accordingly left on his physiognomy this visible record of his opinion—having received these disqualifications for the service, he had retired on a small fortune, and had become a kind of authority in affairs of honour. The name of this gentleman was General Le Beau, although one can scarcely imagine a name less expressive of the appearance of the individual who bore it. On receiving the commands of Elkington, he twirled his long red mustache between his thumb and finger, gave a significant smile, took the note, and proceeded to fulfil his task. Scarcely had he gone when Scarlet entered with three letters. The first was in a hand with which he was not acquainted. It ran thus: “Although Lord Elkington is ignorant of the name and existence of the writer of this note, the latter has the most accurate knowledge of your lordship and his affairs. It is not impossible that your lordship may be at first incredulous on reading it, but a few moments' conversation with your lordship's mother will entirely convince you of its truth. I ain't a rich or a great man like your lordship, but fortune has made me the possessor of a secret which has been for some time a source of profit, and which, I freely tell your lordship, I shall use to my own advantage. Your lordship is aware that your noble father, the Earl of Beverly, was married before he united himself to your mother, the present Lady Beverly. That match was unfortunate, as the world well knows; but—I beg to call your lordship's attention to this fact—there is a circumstance connected with it which neither your lordship nor the world knows, viz., that the issue of that marriage yet survives, in the person of a son, who is, in reality, the heir of your father's estate. This secret exists solely and exclusively in my bosom. The son of the Earl of Beverly, for causes which doubtless can be explained, should it be necessary to investigate the matter in a court of justice, went with his mother to the West Indies. The vessel in which they sailed was wrecked, and all on board perished but two persons. One was the child, who was picked up senseless from a spar (to which the mother had attached him, being herself washed overboard and drowned before she could make herself fast); the other individual saved was myself. We were picked up by the same ship, and I was carried, with the child, into Boston. It had happened that I knew the Earl of Beverly having had a boyish passion for a young female in his household, who, before I left England, had revealed to me certain family secrets of a highly important nature, and, among others, that the mother of this child had fled from her husband in consequence of charges against her honour of the vilest kind. I had seen her in the earl's family (then Mr. Lawson), and I recognised her on board the ship which bore us to the New World, although she was there under an assumed name, and was totally unknown to all but myself. Here, then, I found myself with this boy, whom no one in America knew anything of. Being aware that his father had disowned him, I thought that I might serve both the boy and myself by keeping, for a time, the secret of his birth. For years I kept my eye on him, for a finer fellow never walked. His beauty and character at length attracted the attention of a lady, who, hearing of his desolate situation, took him with her to England, at the age of eight years. Dying, she bequeathed him as a legacy to a lady, who educated him till he left the University. It was then that I informed the Earl of Beverly of his existence. That nobleman arranged with me never to reveal the secret, and has paid me for my silence. “Your lordship will probably learn, on the same day which brings you this, that your noble father has been seized with another fit, which will probably end his existence long before the arrival of my letter. Your lordship, on beholding such an inheritance within your grasp, would not like to be dispossessed by a stranger—a misfortune which would not only leave your lordship penniless, but, I believe, deeply in debt. I have not intrusted this letter to the hands of a third person, upon a question so extremely embarrassing and important, but have come to Berlin in person, and am waiting your lordship's leisure. As this is purely a matter of business, we had better discard all ceremony, and come directly to the point. I received an annuity of £100 from the earl, on condition of keeping this secret, and he assured me that a provision to that effect would be found in his will. A life of idleness, however, has caused me to contract expensive habits, and I no longer find this allowance sufficient. Just at this time, too, I am unfortunately in debt to a considerable amount. I expect from your lordship the immediate means of relief. A note left at the postoffice, to the address of Mr. Oliver Richards, will procure you an interview with me, at the hour and place most convenient to your lordship. I need not hint that, should your lordship be reluctant to negotiate with me, I shall be able, probably, to procure better terms from the other party. “Your lordship's obedient servant, “Oliver Richards.” Elkington's first impulse on reading this strange epistle was to laugh at it as a hoax, and he dropped it on the table as a thing requiring no more attention, while he opened the second letter. It came from the Marquis of Manby. Its contents were as follows: “My dear Elkington: “The melancholy duty has devolved upon me of informing you of the sudden, and, I fear, fatal malady which has attacked your father. He was reading this morning in his library; a violent ringing of the bell called the servants to his side, when he was found struggling in his fauteuil in a fit of the most alarming description. Doctor B—and Sir Richard L—have pronounced his case incurable. It is not impossible, they say, that he may recover so far as to retain life for months, and perhaps a year; but that he can never again leave his bed, or recover his senses except as a prelude to immediate dissolution, is quite certain. I need not say that we deeply sympathize with the distress which this event will occasion your amiable mother, and the pain it will inflict upon you particularly, as I have been told some coolness had unhappily arisen between your esteemed parent and yourself. I need only say, my dear Elkington, that, while I sympathize profoundly with your grief, I am the most sincere, as I am the first of your friends to congratulate you upon the magnificent inheritance which is about to descend to you, and which, I am quite certain, could not have fallen into more worthy hands. Command me in any way, should necessity detain you some days longer on the Continent. “Ever faithfully yours, “Manby. “P.S.—Sir Richard L — has just told me that his patient is beyond the danger of any immediate change; he is quite senseless, and will probably thus remain for an indefinite period.” The perusal of this letter threw a more serious character over the first. He took it up, and read it again with greater attention. It was written in a rude, unpractised hand, as by one not used to a pen; and there was about it a sort of bold familiarity, and an insolence, checked at times by an assumed air of respect, which seemed natural enough under such circumstances. The writer, at least, was aware of the incident related by the Marquis of Manby. He had, it seems, started, the instant the earl's dangerous illness was known, from London to Berlin; and, if it were a hoax, by the offer of an interview he had placed in his reach the means of ascertaining at once whether such a person was in existence. But, should some one present himself in the character of Mr. Oliver Richards, and with such a demand for money, was not the story he had told evidently a bungling and absurd tissue of improbabilities, if not of impossibilities, trumped up by some of those hackneyed London swindlers who, from the recesses of that vast Babel, ever watch, in the goings on of the world around them, an opportunity of making some one their prey? Possibly few heirs have acceded to such brilliant possessions as that magnificent, long-sighed-for inheritance now about to become his own, without being made the object of some audacious fraud of this kind. “It is a contemptible scheme to extort money,” said he, although pale with the ideas which it had conjured up. “It is a stupid, infamous fabrication, and, if the scoundrel presents himself, I'll—” With a shaking hand—for debauchery and unbridled passion had long ago destroyed his nerves, and deprived him of the power of self-command on the most trivial agitation—he broke the seal of the third letter. It was from Mr. Pennington, his father's solicitor; and as he read, the last drop of blood ebbed from his face, and the last spark of courage from his heart. Poverty—sudden disgrace—debt —destitution—the enmity of Shooter, to whom he owed so much, and who was desperate enough to revenge himself in any way—the dreaded Abraham, with his enormous claims—a jail, with all its dismal misery, rushed upon his mind, and with them a thousand other horrors, vague, startling, and insupportable. The letter of the solicitor was in the following words: “My Lord, “You are probably aware of the event which has reduced your distinguished father to a bed of death, from which I am advised by his medical attendant he can never rise, and which precludes all idea of his again assuming the care of his affairs. I beg leave, therefore, my lord, to address myself to you, and shall await your orders. “The point upon which I first request your directions relates to the annuity which, your lordship is probably aware, has been for several years paid by the earl to a certain person by the name of Claude Wyndham. The affair has been conducted with secrecy from reasons never communicated to me, but which, I presume, your lordship is aware of. I have been instructed to deposite yearly, in the hands of Messrs. N. B. &amp; Co., the sum of £500 in advance, without letting these gentlemen or any other person know from whose hand it comes. As the usual period of the deposite is now arrived, I delay making it only till I hear from your lordship; and I beg your lordship to furnish me, at your earliest convenience, with instructions as to future proceedings. “I have the honour to be, etc, etc, “John Pennington.' The whole truth was now before him. It broke upon him with a force which made his head reel. So sudden, so unexpected and blasting was the stroke, that it completely appalled his heart. It seemed like a judgment hurled upon him from Heaven to arrest his guilty and bloody course. Thoughts that made him start now rose upon his mind. The resemblance which he had often perceived in Wyndham to some one he had seen before, particularly when sternness came over his countenance and indignation flashed to his eyes—this singular resemblance, curious as it may appear, he now for the first time perceived, was to his father; but in the smooth face of youth and health, the expression had not been traced to that of the earl, now worn with grief, thought, and age, and his head covered with white hairs. It was, undoubtedly, more a resemblance to the earl as he had been in his youth than as he was now. Lady Beverly's unaccountable anxiety respecting him, too—her pale watchfulness —her morbid curiosity to ascertain who he was— her hatred of him—her unceasing endeavours to ruin him—her unaccountable eagerness to conclude the union with Ida—her half-hinted fears as to the possibility of his losing his father's estates, which had often struck him, and which had always been inexplicable—the letters and journals he had been enabled to read by the aid of Carl—a thousand circumstances rose to his memory, all never particularly reviewed before, all pointing to one astounding truth, that the man he most hated and pursued was his brother—was the destined master of Ida's hand —was the true heir of his father's estates and title —was in every way his successful rival—his superior—his evil demon. His inflated heart, so proud, so vain, so brave in a moment of personal danger, so ready to tax others with cowardice, so ready to inflict every kind of pain on those around him—this bad heart—without religion, principle, or virtue, and Vol. I.—U therefore without the real courage which springs from Heaven and which leads to it—quailed and sunk into a state of entire helplessness and agony. The thought of misfortune to himself cowed him, and in that moment the fashionable and gallant Elkington shook like the meanest coward. He was aroused by the voice of Lady Beverly, who entered suddenly. She was in a rich morning dress, going to call on the Carolans and drive in the Park. Scarlet announced the carriage, and she came in to give him the usual morning salutations in high spirits.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Although Lord Elkington is ignorant of the name and existence of the writer of this note, the latter has the most accurate knowledge of your lordship and his affairs. It is not impossible that your lordship may be at first incredulous on reading it, but a few moments' conversation with your lordship's mother will entirely convince you of its truth. I ain't a rich or a great man like your lordship, but fortune has made me the possessor of a secret which has been for some time a source of profit, and which, I freely tell your lordship, I shall use to my own advantage. Your lordship is aware that your noble father, the Earl of Beverly, was married before he united himself to your mother, the present Lady Beverly. That match was unfortunate, as the world well knows; but—I beg to call your lordship's attention to this fact—there is a circumstance connected with it which neither your lordship nor the world knows, viz., that the issue of that marriage yet survives, in the person of a son, who is, in reality, the heir of your father's estate. This secret exists solely and exclusively in my bosom. The son of the Earl of Beverly, for causes which doubtless can be explained, should it be necessary to investigate the matter in a court of justice, went with his mother to the West Indies. The vessel in which they sailed was wrecked, and all on board perished but two persons. One was the child, who was picked up senseless from a spar (to which the mother had attached him, being herself washed overboard and drowned before she could make herself fast); the other individual saved was myself. We were picked up by the same ship, and I was carried, with the child, into Boston. It had happened that I knew the Earl of Beverly having had a boyish passion for a young female in his household, who, before I left England, had revealed to me certain family secrets of a highly important nature, and, among others, that the mother of this child had fled from her husband in consequence of charges against her honour of the vilest kind. I had seen her in the earl's family (then Mr. Lawson), and I recognised her on board the ship which bore us to the New World, although she was there under an assumed name, and was totally unknown to all but myself. Here, then, I found myself with this boy, whom no one in America knew anything of. Being aware that his father had disowned him, I thought that I might serve both the boy and myself by keeping, for a time, the secret of his birth. For years I kept my eye on him, for a finer fellow never walked. His beauty and character at length attracted the attention of a lady, who, hearing of his desolate situation, took him with her to England, at the age of eight years. Dying, she bequeathed him as a legacy to a lady, who educated him till he left the University. It was then that I informed the Earl of Beverly of his existence. That nobleman arranged with me never to reveal the secret, and has paid me for my silence. “Your lordship will probably learn, on the same day which brings you this, that your noble father has been seized with another fit, which will probably end his existence long before the arrival of my letter. Your lordship, on beholding such an inheritance within your grasp, would not like to be dispossessed by a stranger—a misfortune which would not only leave your lordship penniless, but, I believe, deeply in debt. I have not intrusted this letter to the hands of a third person, upon a question so extremely embarrassing and important, but have come to Berlin in person, and am waiting your lordship's leisure. As this is purely a matter of business, we had better discard all ceremony, and come directly to the point. I received an annuity of £100 from the earl, on condition of keeping this secret, and he assured me that a provision to that effect would be found in his will. A life of idleness, however, has caused me to contract expensive habits, and I no longer find this allowance sufficient. Just at this time, too, I am unfortunately in debt to a considerable amount. I expect from your lordship the immediate means of relief. A note left at the postoffice, to the address of Mr. Oliver Richards, will procure you an interview with me, at the hour and place most convenient to your lordship. I need not hint that, should your lordship be reluctant to negotiate with me, I shall be able, probably, to procure better terms from the other party. “Your lordship's obedient servant, “Oliver Richards.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My dear Elkington: “The melancholy duty has devolved upon me of informing you of the sudden, and, I fear, fatal malady which has attacked your father. He was reading this morning in his library; a violent ringing of the bell called the servants to his side, when he was found struggling in his fauteuil in a fit of the most alarming description. Doctor B—and Sir Richard L—have pronounced his case incurable. It is not impossible, they say, that he may recover so far as to retain life for months, and perhaps a year; but that he can never again leave his bed, or recover his senses except as a prelude to immediate dissolution, is quite certain. I need not say that we deeply sympathize with the distress which this event will occasion your amiable mother, and the pain it will inflict upon you particularly, as I have been told some coolness had unhappily arisen between your esteemed parent and yourself. I need only say, my dear Elkington, that, while I sympathize profoundly with your grief, I am the most sincere, as I am the first of your friends to congratulate you upon the magnificent inheritance which is about to descend to you, and which, I am quite certain, could not have fallen into more worthy hands. Command me in any way, should necessity detain you some days longer on the Continent. “Ever faithfully yours, “Manby. “P.S.—Sir Richard L — has just told me that his patient is beyond the danger of any immediate change; he is quite senseless, and will probably thus remain for an indefinite period.”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIX. The first thing which met the eyes of Lady Beverly as she entered the room was Elkington; his face pallid, his whole manner marked by extraordinary agitation, and three open letters upon the table. “Good Heaven! Edward,” cried she, “what is the matter?” And the sight of his distress banished the smile from her lips. “Shut the door!” said he, in a husky voice. She obeyed. “Where's Scarlet?” “He waits with the carriage.” “Dismiss the carriage.” “Great Heaven! what does this mean? From whom are these letters? What is the matter?” “Do as I bid you!” said he, sternly. Startled to be addressed in so rude a manner, the affrighted woman obeyed without speaking. “Look to the two outer room doors,” said he; “we must be alone, and no eyes must peer at us through cracks and keyholes, as your trusty Carl makes his observations of Mr. Claude Wyndham! Now, madam, I have news for you.” “For the love of Heaven—!” “You have taken, as you thought, very efficient measures to ascertain who is your friend Mr. Claude Wyndham?” “Yes,” said Lady Beverly, turning deadly pale; “what do you know of him?” “That he is the son of my father,” said Elkington —“that he is my brother—that he is the heir of the Beverly estates and titles! The clothes we wear, the carriage we drive, our luxuries, our fortunes, our expectations, are his, and we are beggars!” Lady Beverly stared wildly at her son as he made this abrupt communication with the air of a ruffian, for vice, debauchery, and passion had entirely brutalized his nature. She made an attempt to laugh, but, with an hysterical gasp, she staggered back, and his arm only saved her from falling upon the floor. He bore her to the sofa, and threw her upon it. “D—tion!” said he; “she has been up to this before. I knew she had something in her mind. I wish to God she might lie there till—” He finished in an under tone his dire imprecation, and, taking a glass of water, dashed it in her face. In a few moments she recovered. “Oh, God!” cried she, “what is all this? Is it a dream? Edward, my son—my beloved Edward— you are pale—you tremble—your eyes glitter with unnatural light—say I am raving—say it is a dream —what—when—” “It is no dream, madam,” and he pointed to the letters. “I tell you we are beggars, unless—” Lady Beverly seized the letters, and read them with shaking hands and choking breath. When she had finished she pressed her hands against her forehead with a gesture of deep despair. “Is it true?” demanded Elkington, fiercely. “It is. It is the judgment of Heaven. God's own hand is in it. The bolt which has been so long hovering over my head has fallen at last. We are —we are beggars. Claude Wyndham is—” “Silence, madam,” said Elkington, in a voice of thunder. “Breathe not a word, if you do not wish me to inflict upon you instant death, and to finish the morning by blowing my own brains out.” He opened a case and took down a pair of pistols. Lady Beverly, by the greatness of the danger, and with the effort of a mind, although darkly stained with guilt, yet greatly superior in strength to that of her son, caught his arm. “Let me go, madam. By —, I will never live to be taunted with dishonour—to be the victim of poverty—of debt—of derision—of pity. One single blow, and I shall rest in peace.” “When other means fail,” said Lady Beverly, in a low voice, but one full of calmness, and which arrested and awed him for a moment—“when the world knows what we know—when Claude Wyndham himself knows it—when he has his estates— when no other means are left to save us from poverty, I will, with you, by a single act, end all my shame and misery; but you are giving up the battle before it is fought. Claude Wyndham may be kept ignorant—this Richards may be kept silent. What cause is there for despair yet, even should this secret transpire? Before that event can take place, you may become the husband of Ida, or Claude Wyndham may die! You are then the rightful holder of a fortune of your own.” “But this Richards!” said Elkington, a glance of hope shooting across his gloomy countenance; “with such an insolent cutthroat at my side, how can I secure myself against his demands? Will two —three — five — ten thousand pounds satisfy him? What limits are there to his voracity? The more I give, the more he will require. I shall live a slave with this cursed thing hanging over me. I shall tremble at every whisper!” “There is one thing which you can do to secure an independence, and rescue you from Richards and all other fears; but, before you can comprehend the subject in all its bearings, I must tell you, at length, the fearful and black secret which has preyed upon my mind for so many years, and which, but for you and your interest, I should long ago have revealed, for I am not totally lost to principle.” “To what, madam?” “Do not sneer, my son!” “When you begin to cant, I cannot help it. Tell your story plainly; I really want to hear it, since I am, it appears, so much interested.” “Are the doors perfectly safe?” said Lady Beverly. Elkington rose and opened the door of the drawing-room where they sat. It was a corner chamber, looking on two sides upon the street, and on the other two sides opening into two other rooms, both appropriated by themselves. These outer doors were firmly locked. “You may speak,” said he; “no one can overhear us.” Lady Beverly threw off her shawl and opened her dress, as if with a sense of heat and suffocation; a paleness overspread her countenance like that of death, and she made one or two ineffectual attempts to speak before her voice would perform its office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXX. “We are in a desperate extremity,” said she, “and I am going to confess to you the story of a life which has been wrecked with passion and blackened with guilt. Two motives sustain me in thus laying naked to the eyes of any human being, and especially of a son, the abasement to which I have been sunk. One of these motives is a hope that such a task will be received as a kind of penance, and the other, that the full knowledge of this subject may influence you to acquiesce in what I U 2 shall propose, and thus disburden my heart of a portion of its load of guilt.” “Oh bah! madam,” said Elkington, with a brutal sneer; “pray spare your episodes, and set to the point at once.” “When your father was Mr. Lawton,” commenced Lady Beverly, “I met him by chance at a ball at Lady C—'s. He was the most brilliant and dangerous man of the day. His personal attraction, manners, and character were so peculiar, that few female hearts could withstand his fascinations. He was on friendly terms with my father, General Carlton, and came often to our home; we were not rich, but we were not poor; we lived happily, and even elegantly; and I flattered myself that, if the qualities of the father had first attracted so distinguished a visiter, he was retained, ere long, by those of the daughter. I was sixteen, and very beautiful. Do not think me vain; for my beauty now has passed away; and it was that beauty which depraved my character and darkened my destiny. A fatal gift it often is to woman. I conceived for your father a passion so devoted, that it partook of the fervour of adoration. No Persian ever worshipped the sun with more fidelity, admiration, and faith, than I hung on the changes of his noble face, drank the tones of his voice, and felt the beams of his eyes penetrating into all the virgin depths of my soul. This passion was not alone the affection which a guileless woman bears to the object of her attachment. It was mingled with a deep-seated ambition—a love of admiration—a vanity—a mania, which all combined to render him the sole object of my wishes. He was my life. He was my god. The attention which my beauty excited had already ruined my disposition. I thought alone of my charms—of how I should appear—of my renown as the loveliest girl of the day—of the power which this gave me over all around—of the envy of the women, and the sighs of the men. I thought alone of these. My character was never weeded—my moral nature never developed—my heart disciplined—my mind guided—my passions governed. I was given up to the accidental effects of universal admiration upon a heart not easily touched by feeling, and never instructed in the way of duty. The passion which Mr. Lawton inspired me with became known to him. I do not think he at first loved me; but the idea that a lovely girl had given him her heart—that he had won it without knowing it—softened his feelings towards me into something very like love, and gave me hopes which kept alive, in all its intensity, the love I bore him. “At this period his affairs called him to the Continent, where he made a tour of several years. I heard of him from time to time; at first he wrote often to my father. Then his letters grew less frequent. At length I learned that he was married. The effect was to throw me into a fever, from which I did not recover in many months. “In a year he returned with his wife. I sought information respecting her—this blaster of my hopes. She was lovely beyond my worst fears; lovelier, by far, than I. Without brilliancy, she had softness; and, with few superficial accomplishments, she possessed a mind trained to the loftiest virtue, and stored with solid information. She was far less likely to dazzle in a gay circle than I; but, once known, she was more sure to charm. The peculiar enchantment of her character was a modest and yet perfect intelligence, and an innocence guileless and pure. Both of these qualities shone in her countenance, inspired her words and actions, and shed around her whole manner an enchantment which entirely mastered the high and susceptible heart of Mr. Lawton. Besides this, she was an orphan, left entirely destitute, under circumstances the most likely to touch the ever-generous feelings of your father, which started always at the thought of another's wo. She had always lived in the family of a rich Italian nobleman, whose carriage fell from one of the precipices which beetle over the Mediterranean between Nice and Genoa. Her patron and his lady were dashed to pieces. By a curious chance, she had become alarmed a few moments previous to the accident, and requested permission to walk up the mountain. She was thus saved; but she found herself alone, without friends, without resources. Beautiful beyond description, and trembling at a position so full of danger, your father, who had known the family in Venice, upon whom the merits of this remarkable young girl had before made an impression, and who, through the enthusiastic representations of her unfortunate patron, had conceived a high idea of her character and mind, met her again by accident, and heard with horror of the event which had left her so isolated, and of her entire destitution. He visited her. The modest reserve of her manners did not permit her to see him often; but, in banishing him from her presence, she only heightened its effect and increased his ardour. A profligate English nobleman at the same time persecuted her with attentions the most unprincipled, and offers the most gross. He was a villain, such as affluence and debauchery often produce upon a bad heart and a shallow understanding. Terrified and in despair, she was about to throw herself into a convent, when your father, gifted with an exquisite impression of beauty and moral worth, and ever above interested considerations, offered her his hand, which she accepted, for he had long made upon her the impression which he could always make when he pleased. “But the very perfection of his happiness rendered it fleeting. The honeymoon had scarcely passed, when plans were set on foot by the young nobleman in question, Lord M—, to poison his envied bliss; to ruin the peace and reputation of his wife, and at once to revenge, and perhaps gratify, the unrequited passion which she had inspired. Whispers of the darkest import were put in circulation. The character of her late patron was indirectly attacked; Lord M— openly boasted of the progress of his suit before the sudden arrival of Lawton had caused her to change her plans, and to play for an honourable marriage with a man whose expectations were so brilliant. Of these expectations, however, the poor child knew nothing. She married your father because she loved him, and saw that he loved her; and she would have been far happier to pass her life with him in some peaceful middle rank, than to accompany him to the dazzling yet dangerous heights of London fashionable society. On their arrival in London, Lord M— followed them. He was a profligate in want of excitement. His soul was aroused by a game worthy of him, and he resolved not to abandon the object of his pursuit, but to complete his revenge by alienating from her the affections of a husband whom he feared and envied. I heard these whispers with trembling rapture. They were the first relief my soul had known since the moment I learned that your father had forgotten me in the arms of another, whose simple sweetness so far eclipsed my renowned beauty. By every means in my power I watched and aided this gradual enstrangment. I scarcely knew at first whether or not it was true. A burning hope had risen within me, that even yet Lawton and I might be united. I will not—I dare not—go into the dark details. It is sufficient to say the end was accomplished. My father had recently died and left me my own mistress, with an old aunt who was superannuated, but yet sufficed as my matron, and who soon afterward died. I had become acquainted with this young roué, Lord M—, and, by half convincing him of the truth of his charges, he made me the sharer of them. I managed once to secrete him in my house while Mrs. Lawton was there, and to produce the sudden interruption of her husband. By other means most artfully managed, this was made to wear a conclusive aspect, and Mr. Lawton was convinced, and rushed from his wife with a look of horror and despair. If you will believe me, this was the first intimation the innocent and artless creature had of what was going on. On returning home—alone—terrified—bewildered by some wild and anguish-stricken expressions from the lips of her husband, she received a brief note, ordering her to repair immediately to my house. She did so. There she received another letter, commanding her to leave England immediately, and never to call herself by his name. An annuity was offered her— anything she might choose—but on condition of her quitting London, and never making inquiries after him again. She was advised to remain till her departure at my house (if I would receive her), and thence to make her arrangements for an immediate embarcation for the Continent. I remember the letter ended with, `Go, guilty, lost being; you are free—you are no longer my wife. I raised you from poverty—from despair. Serpent! you have stung me; come no more across my path, or I shall, with the honest indignation of virtue, put my foot upon you, and trample you into the ground.' “I handed her this letter. Never shall I forget the look of dignity, the heavenly radiance which shone around her as she dropped the paper upon the floor, and stood a moment in mute horror and agony. Then the tears gushed from her eyes and streamed through her fingers as she endeavoured to stop their flow. She sank upon her knees, hid her face for several moments in silent prayer, and then rose calmly. Her face was pale all day, as yours and mine, alas! are now. Her eyes were filled with tears half shed; but there was a native dignity— a heavenly pride, which prevented all other outward show of grief or agitation. What most astonished me was, there was no indignation—no noise—no demands to see her lord—no violent protestations of innocence; she took the blow mutely and unresistingly, as an affliction from Heaven. The extreme loveliness of her appearance only made me hate her more, with all the fury of a jealous soul, inspired with the hope of supplanting her in her husband's love. This, and more other dark deeds I was ready to do, goaded as I was by my rapturous hopes and unbridled passions. “One act more I must confess, if the thunder of Heaven will permit me to proceed. There was a vile woman, known as such by all the town, whom Lord M— brought into the plot without giving her any knowledge of the persons. To her house, the constant resort of wild young men, we sent this unsuspecting girl, to remain till she could embark for Calais. By this house Lord M— managed to have Lawton conducted, as if accidentally, so that he saw his once adored wife talking with a person, with whom to speak was to acknowledge all. In this house she was delivered of a son. Lawton was made acquainted with the fact. He was one of those men whose high sense of honour admit of no compromise, and who, in their abhorrence of vice, go to the last extreme. This hapless girl had so utterly possessed his confidence—had so completely mastered his soul—that nothing short of what he had seen could have determined him to believe her unworthy. He had, however, seen. He had heard of the heir to his house, brought into the world in shame and dishonour; and kneeling down, he swore solemnly to his Maker to banish them both from his heart—to hear nothing from them—to ask nothing of them—to tear them off—and let them `down the wind, a prey to fortune.' “It was scarcely possible to believe that a creature so soft and inexperienced possessed a character so firm and high. These qualities were indeed as conspicuous in her as they were in her husband. Neither, when once insulted and injured, as they each believed themselves to be, was capable of the slightest attempt at compromise or explanation. He, although it crushed his heart, never pronounced her name again—never asked after her—never wavered in his resolution to turn his face and his soul from her loveliness and her guilt for ever. Whatever might have been her fate, whether she broke her heart, or starved to death in the street, it was the same to him; and I believe—so deeply had the blow wounded him—that if he had seen her, in all the power of her charms, upon a scaffold, and known that a word from his lips would have rescued her, that word would not have been spoken. He had sworn to make her a stranger; and he is one, as you know, who, when fully roused to a resolution, never breaks it. There are wavering natures, who may be melted by the sight of extreme wretchedness to pardon any injury. Injuries of an ordinary kind no one would have been more ready to forget than he; but she had not only destroyed his happiness and his confidence in human nature, but she had abased his name—blasted his honour— broken his heart. He had cast her off to plague, famine, and suicide— to guilt and wo, here and hereafter. “Like him, she was also firm. I am convinced that innocence more pure never appeared upon the earth; but in her tender and trusting soul she possessed till then, as undreamed of by herself as by others, a nature as inflexible, as unbending and haughty, as that of her husband. The parting letter of him whom she so tenderly loved came upon her like the trumpet of death. All the other evils of the world, bursting together upon her head, could not equal this sudden blow. She had been raised by him from poverty. She had loved him with a trustingness which such women often put into their love. She had committed her happiness and honour to his care. She had supposed that, all mankind uniting against her, and believing evil of her, he would never be shaken by any proof; and yet, upon some hearsay—for she little knew the extent of the intrigue against her—without notice—without a hearing—without one word of explanation, he had cast her off—had published her ruin—had cruelly turned her adrift, friendless and bewildered, upon the world from whose dangers he had rescued her. If his confidence in human nature was shaken, so was hers; but her resolution was instantly conceived and put in practice. The annuity he offered she did not apply for. Though left penniless in her painful situation—about to become a mother—and not knowing where to go, she would have died with her infant rather than accept relief from the hand that had thus spurned her. The plausible lady to whose house I had recommended her, offered her, as she thought, from simple benevolence, an asylum till her illness should be over. This she accepted with tearful gratitude, as aid from Heaven. The letter of her husband she returned in an envelope to the hand that sent it, with no other comment than the stains of tears which had half effaced its fierce and burning words. When her health and that of her child permitted, she wrote me her desire to set off instantly for the Continent. As eager as herself to hasten her departure, I furnished her the means. She sailed, without seeing me again, for Havre, and there, I understood, she met a family by chance who had formerly known her. Whether she related to them her whole story, or what means she took to excite their sympathy, I do not know; but they kept her, I understand, as a governess for two or three years, when, from what cause I never learned, she embarked for the West Indies. As a sad end to so sad a life, the ship was Vol. I.—X wrecked, and most of the crew and passengers perished. She particularly was mentioned among the rest as having been washed overboard and drowned in the early part of the storm. This news found Mr. Lawton an altered man. Having striven long and unsuccessfully against the impression the affair had left on his mind, it was more a relief than a pang; and he learned, without allowing himself even the weakness of a sigh, that these two unfortunate beings, who had so painfully clouded his bright youth and stamped his name with dishonour, were swallowed in the sea, which, if it could not wash out their stains, buried them for ever beneath its waves. I thought, then, that he had succeeded, or would succeed, in forgetting her; but I now know his attempts were vain, and that his apparent indifference was a mere effort of mind, concealing, not destroying, the feeling of his heart. He did, however, try to efface her image; and, as a means, he resolved to marry again. It needed no great art in me to become the object of his choice. Love again, I believe, he never could. But he hoped, by creating himself a new home and new duties, to succeed in turning from the past. A short time after the flight of his wife he succeeded to the title and estates of his father, and was subsequently created Earl of Beverly by his late majesty. Immediately after this event we were married, and I thus attained the summit of my wishes. But, alas! what I had done so much to obtain gave me no happiness. Instead of the tender husband I had pictured, I have found in your father a cold and gloomy companion. He seemed shocked at marrying as soon as the indissoluble knot was tied; and in less than a year, immediately on your birth, conceived an aversion both for you and myself, which has but strengthened with every succeeding hour. A thousand times I have wished the past undone; for my doom, in being obliged to live with the man I loved only as an object of dislike, has been a penalty for all my crimes. I have only to relate that, before our marriage, he called out Lord M—, who shot him through the thigh, which has rendered him lame ever since, and from which wound, on taking the slightest cold, he suffers, as you have seen, the most dreadful pain. These circumstances combined, ruined his temper and character. He at length resorted to the pleasures of the table and cards to divert his attention from himself. From one of the most intellectual and firm-minded men, he has become a voluptuary and a slave of violent passions. His heart wants all the softening and purifying influences of the affections. He loves nothing, and probably the greatest objects of his dislike are his wife and son. “More than twenty years have thus passed away. The news of the death of his wife and child were confirmed, and the subject was only remembered by me as one of shame, guilt, repentance, and self-reproach. Many a sleepless night it has cost me. Many a wretched hour, passed even in the midst of gayety and fashion. Often and often I have wished for an opportunity of repairing the evil I have done—of revealing to your father the whole truth— and of surrendering the ill-gotten wealth, which, even while I enjoy it, cries out against me. I have lived long enough to know that nothing can compensate for the loss of self-approbation. It is the secret fountain of cheerfulness and contentment. But what opportunity had I to accomplish this end? Your father, if he knew the truth, would only be more wretched; I feared also his dreadful temper; and they who, alive, could profit by my confession, were dead. By revealing it, also, I should disinherit you, to throw those vast estates upon a stranger. It is one of the curses of vice, that when at length we discover that its path is beset with horrors, retreat itself sometimes becomes wicked as well as dangerous, and we cannot recover the straight road, where alone our happiness lies, without sacrificing others besides ourselves. You may imagine my sensations on beholding, one evening, here in Berlin, this Claude Wyndham rise like an apparition on my path. The moment I saw him, I saw your father as he was in his youth. The same dignified and noble carriage—the same beauty and intellect of countenance—the same calm, clear eye—now gentle as a woman's, and now full of a sternness which quails before nothing, but gazes steadily, like the eagle, into the very sun. In his character I perceive, too, the same magnificent scorn of everything paltry and mean—the same invincible energy of resolution, which places itself against all mankind and against its own happiness, rather than sacrifice one of his proud prejudices— rather than lower a hair's-breadth his lofty head. I saw all this in Wyndham. On informing myself, I ascertained to a certainty that he was your father's son; and when I saw him obviously touched with the beauty and character of Ida—who is not unlike her who had his father's first vows—I trembled for her and for you. It seemed a double judgment upon me, that the phantom of the very man whom I had so loved in youth should rise before me now as my greatest enemy; and that a sweetness and beauty, like that which had once withered beneath my look, should now appear to baffle all our hopes, and take from us the last certainty of independence. Now you comprehend the reason of the agitation which you have so often remarked in me since our arrival in Berlin. I have, indeed, lived in a kind of hell, which, if they who sin could see it, would for ever after keep stainless every human being. I did hope that this denouément might be avoided. I bribed his servant Carl to learn how far he was himself acquainted with his history. I saw he was totally ignorant of it, but that his father knew of his existence, and has furnished him the means of support, although in a way which marks the stern fidelity of his abhorrence, and proves that he would never be willing to receive him but on being acquainted with the innocence of his unhappy mother. I will confess farther, Edward. Notwithstanding my remorse, I cannot overcome the strange passions which are now habitual to me. On the appearance of the true heir of your father's estates, instead of seizing the often desired occasion to undo a part of what I have done, I felt the baleful passions of my youth resume their sway over my heart. I wished him dead, and I wished your hand might remove from our path such a dangerous enemy in an honourable meeting. Surely there would have been no guilt in this, at least on your part; for gentlemen fight and kill each other every day. I strove to make you hate him as much as myself; for I did hate as much as I feared him. I endeavoured to produce a duel; and I hoped that he would render our task more easy by challenging you. He has, however, wrapped himself up in an idea that this species of combat is wrong; and I feel now that nothing will make him forego this opinion, or act contrary to it. It is the very nature of his father. “In the midst of my plans come these dreadful letters, and ruin stares us in the face. I am now about to make a proposition to you, which at first you will doubtless reject, but which, upon reflection, you will find the safest course. You must remember I have given this subject years of meditation, and have prepared myself for every event.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">X 2 CHAPTER XXXI. Elkington, with his elbows on the table, and his chin leaning on his two clinched fists, had listened to this long and astounding recital with an attention which scarcely allowed him leisure to breathe. His eyes were fixed on his mother, and his bloodless face betrayed his despair. On the conclusion he drew a long breath, and changed his attitude for the first time since its commencement. His motions were slow and thoughtful, and his agitation seemed to have subsided into gloomy reflection. “What is your proposition?” said he, in a husky voice. “Let us first see how the case stands!” said his mother, placing the end of her fore finger on her thumb by way of calculation. “This secret is already known to—” “Tell me your proposition at once,” said he, “and in the fewest words possible.” There was a fierceness in his manner, now deeply agitated as he was, which partook of the savageness of a wild beast. “This is it, then,” said she, tremblingly. “Ask an interview with Claude Wyndham. Bind him previously by oath, whatever may be the result, not to betray the subject discussed. Offer to put him in possession of the history of his family—to present to him a father who will receive him with love, and a fortune beyond his wildest imagination—this, on condition of his binding himself to allow you one half of the estate received. It will be his interest to do so; and if he says he will make the allowance, he will. I hate, I loathe him, but I know that if he gives his simple word, it is stronger than other men's bonds. This is an offer which he cannot refuse. From a nameless traveller he will become a nobleman of rank. From almost a beggar he will suddenly become immensely rich. The dearest wish of his life will be gratified. He can then marry Ida, whom you only value for her fortune. You will then be above want, my bosom will be disburdened of the load which oppresses it. Your father, if he lives, will be happy. You and I will retire to Florence or Naples, where we can lead the remainder of our lives in pleasure uninterrupted by the fears which have destroyed me ever since I wandered from the innocence of youth. Think of this, my son, I conjure you. It is the only, the last request your guilty mother makes you. Say you consent, and let Claude Wyndham assume his station in society. I shall die then in peace, feeling that Heaven has forgiven me all my guilt.” “You are a fool!” said Elkington. “Edward, how strange, how fierce you are! Have you no consideration for the mother who—” “No, none. It is to your accursed passions, then, that I am what I am. Your vices cursed me before I came into the world. I might have been as free, as noble, as pure from evil as this man, who now stands scornfully between me and every hope, ready to tear from me my rank and fortune, and—for God knows whether the mother too is not saved—to brand me—me, madam—with the name which I have so often hurled at him. And now, because you are tired of the wages of sin—now that you are old, and hackneyed, and near your death, perhaps—I must descend from my rank—I must fling away my wealth —and, just as I am entering into one of the most brilliant positions possible, I must turn back—sneak away—become an exile from my country—the mark of scorn and the victim of dishonour—in order that you may have pleasant dreams—that your heart may enjoy the luxury of peace—that your dying bed may be solaced by canting priests and idle visions of hereafter. No, madam. The mercy you have shown to others you must expect. I disclaim you as a mother if you proceed in your design. I command you to suffer me to be the master of my own affairs. I will not enter into any compromise with this fellow, nor with any man. I will play for the whole stake. I will be all or nothing. I will be the Earl of Beverly and master of this inheritance, or I will blow my brains out. I will have no middle course. I won't go to this high-born minion to sue—and kneel—and to be spurned—pitied— forgiven, perhaps. D—n! He shall learn what it is to deal with a man. I play for the whole, and wo betide—” “Edward, my son—my beloved son, you rave— you are mad—you know not what you say—what you do. I will comply with all your wishes. I am guilty—I will become more so—I will live in anguish—I will die in despair—only do not look on me in that frightful manner!” “Then listen to me! Claude Wyndham must be put out of the way!” Lady Beverly turned pale, and sunk back upon the sofa. “What do you mean?” she faltered forth; “would my son become an assassin? Rather than that, I will myself seek him—I will tell him all—I will—” A fierce blow from the hand of her desperate son nearly struck her down, and she staggered back upon the sofa. “Oh God!” she cried, covering her face with her hands, “do not take me yet!” “You drive me to desperation,” muttered Elkington, with a sulky composure; “and when I am goaded—you wonder—you—” There was a dead pause. “Forgive me, my mother!” said Elkington, tears springing from his eyes; “some demon has possessed me.” Lady Beverly made no reply; but the deadly paleness of her neck, ears, forehead, and all that her hands, still pressed against her face, suffered to be visible, and of the hands themselves, showed the effect which this act had had upon her. “Forgive me!” said Elkington. “Forget it! Forgive me, my mother! I am a brute.” “I forgive you, Edward,” said Lady Beverly, in a voice altered with agony, and yielding one of her hands to his grasp; “but forget, alas! it is not in my power. I forgive you, for I am myself to blame. These fierce passions, unbridled by principle or religion—that fearful disrespect of all things, human and divine—it is I who have suffered them to reach their present state unchecked. I forgive you, my poor, my wretched son.” “Then hear me,” said he, “and hear me with calmness; and, since you see the violence of my temper—which I know as well as any one, but which I cannot now help—do not oppose me. I cannot bear contradiction. I cannot, and I will not.” “I will be in your hands as wax,” said Lady Beverly. “Then hear me. I have no design of taking the life of my arch enemy but in an honourable way— in such a way as becomes a gentleman—and as gentlemen acknowledge to be right and necessary. He shall meet me. He shall, or I will pursue him like a bloodhound.” “He will not.” “But I tell you he shall; no man can refuse if another chooses to pursue him. If he does, it must be at the sacrifice of his honour—his fame—his place in society—his friends—the respect of men— the companionship of women. I have sworn he shall meet me, and he shall. The annuity allowed him by my father shall be instantly stopped. It will leave him a beggar, and perhaps in debt. I will drive him to desperation and destitution; and, since he has chosen to insult me in so open a way, as no man shall do and live, I feel myself excusable in going to any extremity. Once in the field, it shall be my care to silence his claim, and then no one stands between me and my rights.” “You must choose your own course,” said Lady Beverly; “I have said what I should do. But you are now the master, and I will not oppose you.” “Good-by, then,” said Elkington, “for the present; I have letters to write.” Lady Beverly left the room; but, having passed the door, she looked back. Elkington had already sat down and seized a pen. She gazed at him a moment, raised her eyes to heaven full of tears, and a deep sigh broke from her bosom as she slowly withdrew to hide, in her own room, her various emotions. Elkington wrote a letter, sealed it, and handed it to Scarlet, with orders to put it instantly into the post. Having finished this brief task, he mounted his horse, and dashed off into the endless and shadowy alleys of the Park, to lose, if possible, in rapid motion the sense of his perilous position. He had no sooner gone than a form crept stealthily from under the bed, and Carl, with a silent caution which eluded all observation, his face somewhat pale with the interest excited by what he had heard, glided out of the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXII. The letter which Claude had taken from Elkington he sent again, by a more faithful messenger, to Count Carolan, without stating anything of the scene which we have described respecting it. The same hour he received a challenge from little General Le Beau. The general was made acquainted with the resolution of Claude not to receive it. The alternative to meet Le Beau himself was then submitted to him. This was also politely declined; upon which General Le Beau declared his intention to horsewhip Mr. Wyndham in the street, if he did not punish him more seriously. “I shall certainly horsewhip you or shoot you,” said General Le Beau, with a nervous twist of the body, which awkward habit he had acquired from the wound already mentioned. “I am extremely obliged to you,” said Claude, “for notifying me of your intention; and as being shot, from what I see, is a disagreeable thing, I shall instantly take measures to protect myself from a calamity which seems as little favourable to grace as temper.” “You are a coward, sir!” said Le Beau. The fierce little general believed that this word would cause his antagonist to explode like a powder-magazine at the application of a torch; and he even stepped slightly back, as if, being secure of his ultimate course, he was willing, either from curiosity or prudence, to observe, at a reasonable distance, the first burst which was to follow this cabalistic epithet. Though obviously prepared to be astonished, his surprise more than equalled his anticipations, when, instead of turning deadly pale or furiously red, trembling in the knees, and endeavouring to knock his (the general's) brains out or his own with the first adequate utensil within his reach, Wyndham, with a very quiet smile and a wave of the hand, which actually had some appearance of being intended for satirical, replied, “You will not be offended, general, if I remark, that I differ from your opinion of me as much as I do from that which you appear to entertain of yourself.” “You shall be posted, sir!” said the general, with a prodigious twist; “and since, sir, you are—” “I am very sorry, general,” said Claude, “to be unable at present to listen to your interesting observations, especially as your ideas are so extremely sensible. I have at present the misfortune to be occupied with more important duties. There is one thing, however, upon which I should really like your candid opinion.” “I am not afraid to give my opinion upon any subject, and to stand by it like a gentleman,” said the general, with a formidable frown. “Well, then, you have, I believe, had time to examine fully the interior of my apartment. I now wish you to direct your attention to—” “To what, sir? to what, sir?” demanded the general, the gash upon his cheek becoming doubly inflamed by the effects of rage. “The outside!” said Mr. Wyndham, rising quietly and opening the door. The formidable little man opened his eyes, or, rather, his eye, for one of them was so drawn down by the wound as to be always extended to about twice the size of its companion; and never did Jupiter, in one of his grand fits of fury, look more indignant and threatening. Luckily, however, he possessed his rage without his thunder. If he had been gifted with that dangerous weapon, at Claude's order to his servant to show the general down stairs! our hero's merriment would have probably received a check which must have ended him, and these volumes as a consequence. It was evident that the general had some desperate intention; so, while he was gone to render an account of his mission to Elkington, Claude quietly presented himself at the police, and laid a statement of the affair before that tribunal, after which General Le Beau gave him no farther trouble. On meeting him in the street a few days afterward, he looked exceedingly ferocious, and gave an unusually violent twist with his body, which, with his wounded cheek, rendered him a formidable object, although his enmity did not proceed farther than several glances of a decidedly indignant kind. The general was subsequently heard to say, that, if it had not been for the interference of the police, he would have sent Monsieur Claude Wyndham to the devil, au plus vîte! He at the same time lamented that he lived in an age so far sunk in barbarism as not to allow intrepid little generals like him to shoot people, without subjecting them to that sort of ungentlemanly annoyance. Claude had scarcely arranged this affair, which he did much to his amusement, and without making any mention to the police of Elkington, when he received a roughly-written, dirty note in German. It was from a stranger, in the following words: “Mr. Claude Wyndham: “Sir: I take the liberty of addressing you, to ask you to come to my house and visit a certain Monsieur Rossi, a teacher of languages, who lies at my lodgings in a very distressed state. He has begged me to send for you, as he says, although but slightly acquainted with you, you are the only person in town of whom he dare ask a favour, or who knows anything of him. You can see him at any time. “Your obedient servant, etc., etc., etc.” This letter was odd, and, taken in connexion with his last night's adventure in the Park, might possibly be a snare. He knew no Monsieur Rossi, and at first he determined not to go. In a few moments, however, he took a different view of the subject. This might be some poor fellow in distress, from which his hand might relieve him; and the idea of leaving unnoticed an appeal from some unhappy being, perhaps on the bed of death, who had selected him from the crowd as one not likely to be callous to such an appeal, induced him to change his Vol. I.—Y mind. It was late in the day, and nearly the hour of dinner; but, having no other occupation, he determined to go at once. He had not walked far, when he met Digby, who was passing him without recognising him, so busily was the poor fellow engaged in his own thoughts. Whoever watches the ever-flowing current of a city population, will often observe persons who, although borne by their corporeal legs along the street and through the crowd, are, in fact, as far as their minds are concerned, acting some part in a different scene. Many go on talking to themselves, moving their lips, and showing, by the changes of their features, how entirely they are absorbed in their own cogitations. Digby was one of these. As he went by he was evidently engaged in some violent imaginary dispute, probably with Mrs. Digby, or perhaps with Elkington, who now received a more fluent setting-down than he had been able to give him on the real occasion of their quarrel. His brows were contracted, his face was red, his lips were in rapid motion, and he was swinging his arms backward and forward, not without their occasionally and unconsciously coming in contact with a passer by; more than one face was turned to take a second look at him. The shopkeepers, lounging at their doors, arched their eye-brows; and more than one little boy—those acute observers—stopped to gaze with astonishment into his face; and, when he was at a reasonable distance, gave a hearty laugh or a loud whoop, which the honest fellow little thought directed against himself. Suddenly he appeared in the crisis of his conversation, and, inattentive to everything else, he strided on in the path of a rough-looking man, who turned out half way, but against whom, notwithstanding this courtesy, Digby ran with such force that each was whirled round by the violence of the collision. The stranger turned back, with a fierce countenance and clinched fist, and demanded in German what he meant. Digby stood stupidly gazing at his angry face. The question was repeated in a more furious tone, and answered in English with a stammering hesitation which would have rendered any language unintelligible; and the insulted pedestrian, losing patience at the idea that the insult was intentional, seized Digby by the collar, amid a crowd which had already began to collect, and was in the act of inflicting a summary vengeance, when Claude stepped up to his relief. He explained that he was a stranger, ignorant of the language, and that he could answer for his absence of mind, which had occasioned the accident. The good man willingly received the apology from one of Claude's appearance and manners, and respectfully assured him of his satisfaction. The parties separated, the crowd dispersed, and Digby said he would accompany Claude on his walk. “Did you ever see such — a — a — born fools,” said Digby, “as these Germans are? Only to—to think, now, of that great fellow setting on me in that style. In England such a thing would be impossible.” “In England he would probably have knocked you down without a word!” said Claude. “Well—if he had—I should have had—him up —and—a—a—punished him. But here—no laws —no newspapers—no courts—no Parliament—no— a—a—no nothing.” “You must not be so severe upon my good friends here,” said Claude; “and remember that a poor Prussian in London would be even worse off than you are here.” “Ah! if I could catch one of these fellows there, wouldn't I let him have it? Why, I haven't met one here who hasn't either—a—a—cheated me—a —a—kicked me, or tried to knock me — a — a — down. It's infamous! I think I've done with travelling this king's reign. So I've made up my mind, and I'm going up to London.” “But will madam consent?” “I've turned over a new leaf with Mrs. D—. She's a woman, and women are all alike, and must be treated in the same way. They must be governed. Don't you think so?” “Why, as to their being all alike—” said Claude, Mrs. Digby's form recurring to his memory by the side of Ida's. “Oh, I mean,” interrupted Digby, “not in person; some are tall—some are short—some lean—some fat—some handsome—and some ugly; but I mean in their hearts. Come afoul of any of their kinks, and they're as like as two peas. They're all of 'em women—and that's the whole of it.” “They certainly are women,” said Claude, “but we must, on that account, not be too hard upon them. Heaven has made them of a finer material—a more fragile construction—and we should accommodate ourselves” (he was thinking of Ida) “to their softer and more delicate natures.” “Why, so I do,” said Digby; “but, d—n her! it's of no use. `Delicate nature!' `fragile construction!!' Ah! if you had to deal with my wife one week!” “Pooh! pooh! I should get along with her charmingly.” “Egad, I should like to see you try it. She? the devil himself couldn't manage her. If she gets a knot in her head, there it sticks, in spite of the old Satan. She's now got an idea that she is a fine woman—her head's as full as it can cram of ho-tong —and bong-tong—and boo-monde—and all that sort of thing. Then she thinks to marry Mary to a lord, and that Elkington is to be the man. Now, between you and me, I wouldn't have that fellow in my house. He's a—a—” (Digby looked around to assure himself that the formidable object of his displeasure might not be within hearing) “a puppy, and thinks just as much of marrying Mary as he does her interesting mamma. I've told Mrs. Digby so—but no, nothing'll do. She must push into every —a—a—soirry where she can get an invitation. There she goes a gallivanting about with old Beeswax.” “Beeswax?” “Yes, old `long pockets'—Lippe, you know—a buying all sorts a things—and she's got all the milliners and mantuamakers in Berlin about her—and she and Moll are so transmogrified, that, egad, I don't know 'em when I meet 'em in the street. What do you think I caught 'em at yesterday?” “Indeed, I hope nothing seriously disagreeable.” “Yes, very seriously. I returned home from a ride, and went into my wife's room. There she stood—half undressed—and Mary in the same predicament; and by their side—what do you think?— a man, sir—a great man—with a pair of mustaches as long as my arm—a standing between them—as— cool, sir—as—as a—a cucumber; pleasant, wasn't it?” “A man!” “A man, sir—a tailor, sir—a lady's tailor! While I was staring at him the door opened, and old `long pockets' poked his ears in, walks me up to the ladies, with a pair of gamborge coloured gloves on— and they in that situation. They had sent for him to enterpret for them. I stood by, and heard `long pockets' explaining to the tailor how their frocks were to be cut higher here—and lower there—and not to have any wrinkles in this place—and to be made a little fuller in that. If you catch me a travelling for pleasure again, you may eat me, sir.” “Oh, nonsense; you're too serious about it.” “The tailor had no sooner gone than in steps a strapping fellow dressed like a duke, and with a pair of mustaches that you might have tied in a bowknot behind his ears—the fellow! and down sat my interesting females to have their heads dressed, and a bushel basket full of wheat, and flowers, and Y 2 things stuck in. `Madam Digby,' says I, `ain't you ashamed of yourself—to admit men—in this fashion into—into your room?' `Good gracious, John,' says she, `how can you be such an awful fool?' You know that's a very favourite expression of hers. `Don't you see,' says she, `these poor creatures are no more than dumb beasts, and don't understand a word we say!' `And, papa!' says Mary, `everybody does so—and what everybody does can't be wrong!' Then comes a bill for dresses, three hundred thalers—then a subscription ticket for the theatre and the opera—and the French theatre. Then their learning to play whist—and Mrs. Digby loses a few guineas a night; and, to cap all, some fellow is a going to give a ball costoomy, and Mary's going as Hebe, and Madam Digby as Mary, Queen of Scots.” “I should think Mrs. Digby would look Queen Elizabeth better,” said Claude, smiling. “No, sir—she'll look back to London — that's what she'll look—and old `long pockets' 'll look for some other place. I've cut the French. It's the greatest trash on earth. Did you ever candidly see such a pack of stuff as it is? If these fellows can get a que—and a se—and a lui, and a y huddled in, neck and heels together, and always the cart before the horse, they think they're elegant; and then old `long pockets'—how horribly he talks through his nose! He never says no—he says non so non. I believe that's one reason he has such large nostrils. The fellow has them like a horse. He kept me half an hour the other day trying to say non. I wouldn't do it, sir.” “I fear you have not been much pleased with Berlin.” “Berlin—I utterly detest it! I don't understand anything nor anybody. There isn't a newspaper that I can read—a sign that I can make out—all the bills and things pasted up along the street. There, now! look at all that trash yonder!—see that!— that's all Greek to me—though there's always a crowd about them a reading them with their mouths wide open. I can't buy anything, for they don't understand me. When a bill comes in, I pay it without knowing what it is; and I've no doubt I pay one two or three times over. Yesterday I walked out and came to a place where there were a thousand people collected—all greatly excited about something. `What's the matter here?' says I, forgetting that the poor wretches couldn't speak English. The man began palavering to me, with his eyes starting out of his head, and pointed at somebody who was going along. `Thank you, sir,' says I, `for your information.' Then I asked another— and another; no one could talk to me in a civilized tongue. All of a sudden, up jumped a great big fellow on a barrel—and began to shout. The crowd gathered around him, I among the rest. He went on at a violent rate for five minutes, then they all began to clap. He went on a little longer, then they set up a laugh; and when he had said something more, they gave three cheers, and then cleared out. Now what the devil all that was about, I shall never know to my dying day. `Give me old England yet,' says I. But this I found out a short time after, namely, that my watch was gone. Some infernal, infamous scoundrel had picked my pocket.” “Oh, you must not mind these trifles!” said Claude; “when you are an older traveller, you'll think nothing of them.” “I don't know what you call trifles—but I don't call them—a—a—any such things. Last night I went to the opera alone. I went into the pit, and it being early, I got a good seat near the stage. Just as the house was full, there came a man and—a— a—began to talk to me. I told him I couldn't understand him, and there was no use o' his going on. But, notwithstanding that, he continued a talking on, louder and louder; and at length, taking me by the shoulder, hauled me out of my seat, and shoved me along away to the back part of the pit, where I couldn't see anything, pointing at the same time to a number on the seat and to a number on the ticket I had given him.” “Have you been much into society lately?” “No; once I allowed my women to wheedle me into one soirry, and that was the last. Why, sir, the people that knew me perfectly well in my own house wouldn't speak to me. `Can you tell me who yonder gentleman is?' said I to one. `Bon soir,' said he, and he passed me. `Are we to have a supper?' said I to another. `Bon soir,' said he, and off shot he. `Good-evening,' said I to a lady whom I had talked to half an hour the evening before. She opened her eyes, looked right over my shoulder, and began a talking to a big man behind me in a uniform. `Well,' says I, `don't be discouraged,' says I to myself; so I went up to a very remarkably civil young gentleman, who had come to my house with Elkington—drank my Champagne, and won ten Louis of me at whist—with an eyeglass stuck into his cheek, and held up by wrinkling his eyebrow over it, without holding on to it with his fingers. `This is rather a curious sort of a company,' says I to the very civil young gentleman; `don't you think so, Mr. Whattle?' What do you think he did?” “Contradicted your opinion, I suppose,” said Claude. “No, sir—he wheeled about—stuck his face right plump into mine—peering at me through his glass, with his eyebrow all wrinkled up; so, egad, I thought he was going to butt me over like a ram, after regarding me a little while in this way, so that he will know me again if he meets me in Jerusalem; and, just as I had began to smile in a very familiar way, and held out my hand, thinking he was a going to say, `How are you, my dear Digby—is this you?' what do you think he did?” “Turned away, I suppose,” said Claude, scarcely suppressing a smile. “Flat as a flounder!” said Digby, in a tone of indignation; “and, holding out his hand to a person standing next to him, he says, says he, `Devilish hot! ain't it?' says he. `Devilish!' says the other; and then he told another fellow on the other side of me that he had called on him that afternoon, and the other fellow said he was `enchanté.' Do you think I'll submit to such impertinence? Not I.” At length they reached the house designated by the note. It was a wretched building; a filthy gutter ran from the court into the street through the archway which formed the principal entrance. The walls were dirty, black, and dilapidated, the stairs broken and unswept, the doors hanging on one hinge, the court full of offals and stagnant water. When they arrived at the third story, they were received by a man of indigent appearance, and ushered into rooms desolate and almost unfurnished. On making particular inquiries respecting the young invalid, the good man informed him that this poor fellow was a teacher of languages, who had lived with him for a long time, exciting his curiosity by his eccentricities; at first he denied himself the common comforts of life, but laid out what little money he could gain at his precarious occupation on his toilet. “He seemed always particularly anxious to appear well dressed,” said the man; “in this, for some time, he succeeded, but latterly he had grown less and less tidy; his old and much-worn clothes were no longer renewed. His manners, from cheerful gayety, became deeply serious. He avoided all society and amusement, and appeared plunged in profound grief. One day, not long ago, he had been brought home in a state of insensibility, which was succeeded by a raging delirium. He screamed and raved all night. He had no money to pay a physician, and I was as poor as he. We thought of carrying him to the asylum for lunatics, on the idea that he had grown mad, when his malady took a new turn; he became dangerously ill, grew weak and subdued, and gave us no farther trouble than the necessity of taking care of him and feeding him. I would willingly continue to do this, sir,” continued the poor man, “for I never saw a more unhappy creature, and I sincerely pity him; but I am a poor labourer myself, and have a wife and child also, occupied with their own tasks; we have no time, and no money to spend upon him more; and we were thinking of having him removed to the hospital, when he got an inkling of our design, which I believe he did by listening through the keyhole— for he's as cunning as a fox. He taxed me with it; begged, entreated, and prayed so earnestly that we would spare him from such a fate—for I think, sir, he has an idea that being in an hospital is worse than it is—that I told him, if he had means of paying anything, ever so small, for his board and lodging—if he had any friend who would aid him, I would consent to charge nothing for trouble, and to take care of him without profit, only in case of being secured against loss. Well, he then said there was a gentleman who perhaps would assist him if he knew his situation, and he mentioned the name of Mr. Claude Wyndham; a name which, in his delirium, he had often uttered in many various tones.” “Indeed!” said Claude. “This is strange. I am not aware that I know any such person.” “So, in short, sir, I took the liberty of complying with his request, and sending you a note. He told me your address himself. Now, sir, I would only say that, unless you are prepared to do something for the poor devil, you might as well not see him; for he counts upon you. He told me that you were rich, and had powerful friends, and that you could easily gratify his wishes. Will you see him, sir? I really do not believe he will tax your charity long.” Claude explained this to Digby, and asked him if he would go in. “A—a—I—a—beg your pardon,” said the latter, looking at his watch. “I am—a—a—I have an appointment at this very moment—and I shall have to go a mile. You must excuse me from going in to see this poor creature. Besides, I cannot bear— any—a—a—scene of distress. It always hurts—a —my feelings. But don't let me—a—interrupt you. Probably he has something to say to you in private. Good-morning. Adieu.” And, with some marks of precipitation, he withdrew. Claude drew an unfavourable opinion of his friend's character from this little incident; for, under all his stupidity and vulgarity, he had conceived an idea that he was generous and charitable. Being, however, thus deserted, he allowed himself to be ushered into the patient's room. It was a sad home for any one, but struck Claude's feelings with peculiar mournfulness when he reflected that it was the abode, and perhaps the last one on earth, of the dying. There was no furniture but a rough pine-board bedstead and a wooden bench. The cobwebs hung around the smoked and broken ceiling, and the summer light and fresh air were kept out of the little window by a high black wall which excluded the view. Upon this miserable pallet lay a young man of a sallow and pale complexion, much emaciated, and so absorbed in thought that he was totally unconscious that any one had interrupted his gloomy solitude. His hair was black, and very thick and long. His large and dark eyes were fixed upon the ceiling as he was extended on his back. His beard was unshorn, and had grown rank and stiff about his cheeks, mouth, and throat. A faint recollection of such a countenance, scarcely recognisable through the alterations of disease and the overgrown beard, crossed Claude's mind; and the invalid, at a gentle shake from his host, had no sooner started, turned his eyes towards the new-comers, and fixed them with a stern and bewildered look on Claude, than he recognised the young man whom he had first seen planted before the portrait of Ida; whom he had afterward met in the same place and position; who had so oddly deceived him as to the original of the portrait; and who, Ida had informed him, was her Italian master. The recognition was mutual; and a faint suffusion of red over the pallid countenance of the invalid, succeeded almost immediately by a hue more ashy than before, indicated that he knew his guest, and that his image called up some agitating reflection. “How strange!” said the young man; “I didn't think you'd come. I never had any claim on you; but something whispered me to try you—to catch at you, as a drowning man catches at a spar. Oh, sir, what must you think of me?” “My friend,” said Claude, with much sympathy, “you are unfortunate, and ill; and you have done very right to claim the assistance of others. I beg you will not distress yourself, or excite yourself to speak. I have heard your whole story from your friend here; and I agree to furnish you the means not only to remain here, but, if you please, to seek more comfortable lodgings.” “God bless you! You are the only being on all this wide and crowded earth that—some angel surely whispered me to send for you—but you have not heard my whole story.” “Well, well, some other time; now you are weak; you are—” “Some other time may be too late,” said the young man, peevishly; “I do not believe I am long for this world. I must tell you now, and the more so as my story partly concerns yourself.” “What can you mean?” Rossi motioned the landlord to retire, and they were alone. “There is something about you, Mr. Wyndham, which makes me feel I can unbosom myself to you —my weaknesses—my crimes even—without being ridiculed or betrayed. Perhaps I may have assistance from your hand or counsel from your lips. There is something in you which gives me confidence. I shall therefore tell you my story. It deeply concerns you, and I tell it partly in gratitude, and partly to relieve my own bosom.” Claude for a moment forgot the invalid in the interest excited by his words. Confused hopes that something respecting his family might be the subject of the promised revelation—that it might refer to the late mysterious attempt upon his life— in short, he scarce knew what to think, and he betrayed his curiosity in his countenance. “I came to Berlin,” said Rossi, “from France, a poor exile. Count Carolan, to whom I had been recommended, employed me as the Italian master of his daughter; for I am Italian by birth and education, though I have spent the latter years of my life in France, and there rendered myself obnoxious to a great man, who compelled me to abandon the country at the peril of the Bastile. For two years I was in the habit of reading one hour a day with the young Countess Ida. We read the most eloquent and romantic works in our literature. I was friendless and wretched, and very soon after we commenced our lessons, the beauty and character of my young pupil began to sink into my heart like enchantment. We were almost alone at these periods. Madame Wharton always sat with us, but neither she nor Ida dreamed of the feelings I concealed under my calm, cold manner, needy dress, and respectful air. I was thus often left, by a fearful and fatal privilege, to watch daily—at my leisure—in almost uninterrupted solitude, the bewildering Vol. I.—Z charms of a mind and form, for which half the nobility of Berlin sighed—for one familiar hour in whose company many a young noble would have perilled his life. She was with me all grace, modesty, and gentle sweetness. There was no reserve— no pride--no supercilious dignity in her demeanour. She was kind and unguarded before me as if I had been a brother. My very insignificance gained me her bounty, and created a kind of delightful intimacy, fascinating and dangerous beyond my power of resistance. She was also the only female I spoke to—the only friend I had. Her sunshiny and loving nature made her take an interest in me—from my history—my loneliness—my extreme melancholy— and perhaps, unsuspected by herself, from the deep fervour of my respect and submission to her. It sometimes happened, at moments, that our minds and souls met in a kind of equality over some scene in poetry—of intellectual beauty — of passionate love. Then we conversed together in my own language, as two young girls might upon such subjects —of the world—of the vicissitudes and distinctions of society. It seemed to me, sometimes, that she blushed to find that fate had placed her on such an elevation of rank and fortune, and that her heart wandered beyond their gorgeous precincts, to seek simple nature and sweet human happiness, as they lie around the steps and in the heart of cottage maidens.” There was something in this rhapsody of Rossi that awakened singular emotions in the heart of Claude, and, at the same time, exceedingly interested him in the ardour and eloquence with which the poor fellow opened his history. “No one can conceive,” continued Rossi, “the deep enchantment of these interviews to me. The hour spent with her was the only one of the twenty-four not a burden. It was the single star in the sky elsewhere blank. It was the ray of sunshine in the subterranean dungeon of the captive; the sole link which holds him from utter darkness, and connects him with earth and heaven. Month after month rolled away—oh God! how sweetly. I had the address to conceal the fire in my veins, though it only burned stronger for being hidden. Her numerous acts of bounty, sympathy, and gentle consideration only added to its power. She had no prejudices—no pride. She bestowed upon me the same real courtesy which she would have bestowed upon a prince; which, by the absence of formality, was only the more ravishingly sweet to my soul. All other human beings were to me despots, tyrants, and fiends. They frowned on me—trampled on me—put me aside as a useless, worthless thing. Among them I shrank—I crawled—I skulked like a beaten dog. I hated the very sight of my fellow-beings worse than a boar or an adder. Oppression and poverty had taken from my spirit its natural courage and erectness, and made me such a sycophant that I loathed myself. It was only with her that I felt myself a human being, and formed in the image of Him who made my soul immortal. Yes, the truth at last forced itself upon me. I loved this young girl. A blissful madness took possession of me. I never thought how it was to end; that I must one day be separated from her, and banished from her presence, even when residents of the same city, as effectually as if I had been in another continent. I never thought that she regarded me as she might have done, a poor mendicant, totally unconscious that my ideas were other than to receive the recompense of my daily toils, and that I was pleased when it was given kindly. I never imagined that this sweetness—these gentle words—these sunshiny smiles, were not mine alone, but were only shed around on the common air, as the perfume of a flower or the beams of a star. It never occurred to me that this light and happy being might—nay, must, at some time—love—and love another—till, one day, I came at my usual hour, and entered the boudoir where I usually gave my lesson. She was not there. I found myself alone, in that gorgeous and hallowed spot, full of traces of her hand and tokens of her presence. Her drawings—her music—her paintings—her books—her flowers—her writing utensils—her gloves—her embroidery. Sweet objects! they filled my heart with joy, and my eyes with tears. I could not but offer up my humble prayer to Heaven, that, although this beloved creature was not destined for me, I was thus permitted to see her sometimes—to behold the places she inhabited—the things she touched. I approached some of them. I kissed them with wild rapture. The guilty stealth with which I did this inflamed my soul to go on farther with my tender thefts. I pressed her embroidery against my bosom. I approached a rose; it leaned, sweet and odorous, amid the fresh verdure. I touched its cool leaves with my audacious and burning lips. I felt that I was embracing her image; the soothing odour I inhaled as her breath, and the soft and crimson leaves seemed her mouth. I fancied her soul was hidden in this half-opened flower. Lost in a kind of ecstasy, I cast my eyes upon her table. They fell upon a letter. It was addressed to her father. On the corner was your name. A half-instinctive, half-imagined dream that you had made an impression on her heart, had already crossed me. This letter recalled it to me, and made me start. It lay there like a snake amid the flowers. Suddenly her step was heard—light as the young fawn that scarcely brushes the morning dew; and a low-hummed air, from a voice that thrilled my heart, had the melody of the birds' warble in the silent wood.” “Poor fellow!” said Claude, his eyes scarcely discerning the anguish-stricken countenance of the young madman through his rising tears. “I do not know what induced me to step back. Perhaps it was a sense of guilt. I felt like Satan caught in Paradise; for I had become accustomed to consider my poverty as the bitter badge of meanness, misery, and shame. I stepped behind a heavy curtain. She entered and looked around. There is a sensation in watching a young girl like her, when she believes herself perfectly alone—a rapture I never felt before. It seemed as if I—an earthly wanderer—had, by some daring chance, climbed the gates of heaven and gazed into its sacred groves. Alas! alas! for such a blasphemy, the sudden thunder struck me. Breathless—trembling, I knew not why—I fixed my eyes upon her. She went to a broad mirror, and gazed a moment at her full-length form. She then took from her bosom a paper, and read aloud a verse. It was the tender blessing of a girl upon one unnamed. In the weakness and folly of my nature, I thought for one exquisite moment—and it almost paid me for any suffering—that I was shadowed forth in this short and girlish expression of feeling; but, as she finished it, she reached forth her hand to the letter written by you—opened it—read your name aloud— and pressed it to her lips. The step of Madame Wharton startled her. She left the room by one door. I came from my place of concealment. Madame Wharton entered, and presently afterward Ida, once more all gentleness—all gayety—the little hypocrite! “We proceeded with our lesson, but the incident had almost unseated my reason. Madame Wharton sat at some distance with a book. Ida's hand lay so near my own on the table as to touch it. Love and despair combined to take from me all command over myself. I determined that this should be the last time I should see her, but that I would not leave her without once touching that charming hand with a kiss of love. The impudence—the folly—the guilt of such an act did not restrain me. I was mad. I knelt at her feet—I seized her hand—I raised it to my lips—I covered it with wild and burning kisses. She started back, turned very pale, and uttered a faint shriek. “`Mr. Rossi,' said Madame Wharton, starting forward, with a dignity and indignation that abashed me at once, `what do you mean?' “`Farewell for ever!' said I. `Forgive my delirium.' “`Unhappy boy,' said Madame Wharton; `what fatal infatuation!' “`Yes—it is infatuation. It is—madness,' said I; `but never more shall your sight be polluted by the presence of a wretch who must ever after be hated and despised.' “I turned to leave the room, when Lord Elkington stood before me. He had seen the whole incident. He is a demon—that man; and, as such, one day I will pursue him. He advanced and took me by the throat. I was a child in his grasp. He dragged me to the door, and there struck me. The ruffian struck me!” The poor fellow's face flushed crimson at the recollection. “A blow! and before her! I could not resent it. My life failed me. I rushed out of the house. I fell senseless long before I reached home. This is my story. I am dying. I shall not long be here, to suffer a life which has always been a shame and curse to me. Should I ever recover, my first task shall be to be revenged on Elkington. It is that alone which makes me wish for life. It is his heart's blood which alone can wash out the stain I have received. I have now,” continued Rossi, sinking back exhausted on his pillow, “given you my history, and I don't give it you for nothing! I expect that you will supply me with the comforts of life while life lasts. For my part, if I could but end at once the existence of Elkington and Ida—and my own—I should die happy; and that is my nightly dream and my daily prayer!” It would be difficult to describe the emotion with which Claude heard this long recital, and the secret rapture which the passage concerning himself awakened in his heart. He was, then, beloved. He had but to present himself to Ida, and her innocent and gentle nature would not conceal the impulses of her soul. But the restraints upon him were invincible. He felt that, instead of triumphing, he ought to lament that he had so far won the affections of a young girl, whom her happiness, as well as his own duty, compelled him to desert, and to seem to betray. There were some parts of the narration, and particularly the manner of relating it, which suggested the idea that Rossi was not yet altogether in his right mind; and that, in its turn, caused a doubt of the truth of the statement. He, however, assured him and the landlord that every care should be taken of him; that he might send in bills to him to the amount of three thalers a week; and that he would, in addition, procure him a physician, and certain other comforts. The landlord, on being called in, agreed to this proposition; and Rossi discovering an inclination to sleep, Claude gave his card to the host, begging him to send for Doctor B— in his name, and to let him know in case anything should occur. Thus having done everything for the present which he could think of towards satisfying both host and tenant, he retraced his steps towards home. END OF VOL. I.</field>
