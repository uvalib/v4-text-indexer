      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XL. MERIEL to CELIA. Oak-hall, May 17th, 1781. This is a charming romantic place, my dear Celia. There is room for solitude and deep reflection. Oak-hall is situated in a very retired part of the country, and has been the family mansion of the Rooksby's from time immemorial. The house is antique, and inspires one's mind with the true spirit of the days of chivalry. You cannot think, how often I amuse myself with surveying its antique battlements, the massy gates, and deep moat, that surround it; and while I gaze with a kind of reverential awe, I fancy, I am perhaps retracing the steps of many a gallant knight and beauteous dame who formerly have been inhabitants of this ancient dwelling. I am a great admirer of every thing, that wears the face of antiquity not that I would, were I possessed of ever so large a fortune, lay out my money in purchasing a heap of trumpery, that are really of no intrinsie value, only as the fancy of the virtuoso stamps them with the appellation of excellence, because they were made some hundred years before we were born. I cannot deny, that I like to examine any little piece of antiquity, which tends to shew us the progress of the arts or manufactures, and when I enjoy the benefit of any thing useful or convenient I feel a kind of veneration for the genius, who first invented it, let it be ever so mean or trifling. May 20th. Mr. Rooksby arrived yesterday and has this morning, not to my surprize, but to my infinite regret, made me an offer of his hand and fortune. It is not, my dear Celia, that I am stoic enough to pretend, I have an aversion to being raised from a state of dependence A 2 to be mistress of seven thousand pounds a year: but I feel, I shall never regard Mr. Rooksby with the affection, which, in my opinion, is absolutely necessary, to make the married state comfortable, though Mrs. Rooksby tells me, that in this I am mistaken, as she was perfectly happy while her husband lived; and yet she declares she acceded to the union merely in compliance with the desires of her parents. It may be so, Celia, but I am certain I should never be happy with a man, whom I regard with indifference. But I will give you an account of a conversation, I had this morning with this invader of my peace (I must call him so, for had it not been for him I should have felt myself quite happy in my present situation.) We had just finished breakfast, when a servant informed Mrs. Rooksby a poor woman desired to speak with her. The good old lady is benevolent and humane to all her poor neighbours, and the honest industrious when oppressed by misfortune are always sure of meeting a friend in her. I had not been alone with Mr. Rooksby before, since my residence in the family and to tell you the truth, I would gladly have walked ten miles to have avoided it now. But there was no flying; politeness obliged me to sit still; besides I thought it would look so like being afraid of the man, so childish to run away as soon as his mother left the room—that I sat very composedly and took up my work, which opportunely was in the room.—We were silent near ten minutes, when at length he spoke. “May I venture to enquire how Miss Howard likes the situation of my mother's house?” “I think it extremely pleasant, sir. It suits the turn of my mind; I am fond of solitude and should be quite happy were I certain of never wandering from this delightful spot, to the gay regions of fashion, folly, and what is in general termed pleasure.” “How blind are you to your own merits, my dear Miss, if you wish thus to hide in obscurity, beauty and virtue, that would do honour to a court.” “You make me smile, Mr. Rooksby, how would your gay companions ridicule you could they hear you thus lavishly complimenting an humble dependant of your mother's.” “And let them laugh, my dear Miss Howard, for did they know as I do the true value of your worth, they would like me, adore it.” “This, my dear Celia, was not to be answered: so I was obliged to be content with remaining silent and looking like an idiot.” While he continued, “I am fully sensible of my own unworthiness in presuming to become a candidate for Miss Howard's favour. I know how full of error my short career of life has been; but I trust your benevolent spirit will pardon my past follies; and could I presume to hope you would condescend to accept my hand and fortune, I am certain by a constant contemplation of the goodness it would strive to immitate, my heart would soon be an offering worthy of your acceptance.” Dear Celia, how extremely embarrassing was my situation? I felt my face glow. I dared not look up: at length I summoned sufficient courage to speak. “I hardly know, sir, in what manner to reply. If the offer you have just made be seriously meant.” “If it be serious, Miss Howard, can you suppose I would trifle on so important a subject, with any woman, much more with one so truly amiable as yourself. Believe me, my charming girl, there is no event could render me so happy, or convey such unmixed felicity to the bosom of my mother, as to see you become a part of a family which may derive honour from, but can confer none by the alliance.” “Your polite and generous proposal, sir, demands a candid answer. I feel myself infinitely obliged by the regard with which you are pleased to honour me; at the same time I am under the necessity of declining your offer. I hope you will believe I am not ungrateful for the esteem and friendship I have fortunately met with in your mother's family, and permit me to add, I shall always regard her as an affectionate parent and you as a brother: but as to any nearer tie, it never can take place between us.” “Never, Miss Howard. Do not say never—Time and constant assiduity will I hope influence your heart in my favour: for without that sweet hope I must be miserable.” “Indeed, Mr. Rooksby I cannot flatter you. It is at present my fixed determination, never to alter my condition: but were that not the case”— “Your choice would not fall on me. I am satisfied—Some more happy man.” “Pardon me, you are in an error. I am indifferent to all the sex.” “Then why not allow me to strive to awaken the sensibility of your heart. Believe me your happiness should be the whole study of my life.” “Mr. Rooksby, I will be explicit. Were I ever so partial to your virtues, I could not overlook one glaring error in your conduct, an error which not only tarnishes your own reputation, but preys upon your mother's peace of mind.” “You mean my connection with Clara.” “I do.” “Will you permit me, Miss Howard, to enter into a little detail of my conduct through the whole of this unhappy connection. Unhappy! I must always call it, not only from the reasons you have just alledged, but because I foresee my want of fortitude has involved an amiable woman in infamy and ruin; for had I repulsed the first overtures of the unhappy Clara's passion, affronted pride would have assisted in combating her attachment, and she might at this moment have been happy in the esteem and love of her husband and family. I have often wished to explain this affair to my mother and engage her friendship in behalf of Clara, but whenever I attempt to speak, she brands the poor girl with the epithets of artful, vile, enticing siren. Alas, Miss Howard, the unfortunate Clara's greatest error is, a too tender attachment to me.” Ah man! man! said I mentally, how easily does thy vanity, dupe thy reason,— Mr. Rooksby continued— “It may appear odd, that I should wish to enter upon this subject to you, but I am certain you will judge with candour and represent Clara to my mother in such a light as may lead her to befriend a woman, who has sacrificed fame, happiness, and honour to me. You will ask, perhaps, why I do not marry her, as her husband is lately dead, I would answer, that she is not a woman calculated to make me happy. Her temper is impetuous, and though her form is lovely and she has received a polished education, she possesses not that true femenine softness and delicacy which in my opinion alone can render a woman really amiable. My acquaintance with her commenced about four years since, while I was completing my studies at Oxford. At that time her husband Mr. Millar was a counsellor residing at that city. He invited me frequently to his house. I saw Mrs. Millar, and admired her as a lovely accomplished woman; nay more, I pitied her, for I saw she was not happy. Her sister, Miss Ramsay, who resided in the house with her, told me, their father had been a lieutenant in the navy: but age and infirmities obliging him to retire upon his half pay, they found their circumstances greatly straitened. At this time, Mr. Millar paid their father a visit. He was struck with the beauty and innocence of Clara, and though at that time near fifty years old, he had the vanity to think he could render himself agreeable to a girl of seventeen.” “Perhaps,” said I, “it was a benevolent wish to lighten the expences of his friend and place the young lady in a state of independence which urged him to make the offer of his hand.” It might be so, she replied, but whatever his motives might be, gratitude and filial love incited Clara to accept the offer, and sacrifice herself to the man she disliked; to secure ease and affluence to her father and sister: but he lived not long to enjoy the fruits of her kindness. A slow decline carried him off about a year after his daughter's marriage. At this time I was introduced into Mr. Millar's family. Clara was just become a mother; her husband seemed to idolize her; she could not breathe a wish which was not instantly gratified. Yet she was far from happy, and I often saw her turn aside to conceal tears, which seemed to flow from an oppressed heart. One afternoon, Mr. Millar was from home, her sister sitting at the other end of the room reading. Clara rose from her seat on pretence of reaching something from the chimney piece, and stooping, picked up a paper which she presented to me, saying, you drop your letters about very carelessly. I took the paper and perceived it was a sealed letter. I will not shock your delicacy, Miss Howard, by repeating the contents of this letter. I can perceive by your countenance, that you think it a sufficient error for a married woman to entertain an inclination for any other man than her husband without daring to avow her passion. I am sensible, Clara acted with imprudence; but who can answer for the emotions of a heart, under the influence of its first tender attachment? And however culpable, she might be, I think myself more so. I should have never more entered Mr. VOL. III. B Millar's house, when I found how detrimental my presence was, both to his honour and happiness. I should have avoided the society of the fair seducer, and confined myself more than ever to my studies. I am conscious this should have been my conduct; but, alas! it was quite the reverse. I sought every opportunity of being in her company. I encouraged her growing tenderness. Private enterviews ensued, and honour, gratitude, and friendship were all forgotten. Though our entercourse continued, during the whole time I remained at Oxford, Mr. Millar never suspected his injuries. The sister was in our confidence, and she always contrived our meetings in such a manner, that they appeared the effect of chance. Just before I left Oxford, Clara was confined with her second child. This prevented my taking a personal leave. I wrote, informing her of the necessity of my removal, assured her of my grateful affection and that I would take frequent opportunities of visiting her in future. This I said, merely to quiet her anxiety; for reason had began to operate; the mist of passion was dissipated and I was determined to put an end to a connection, at once so dishonourable and unjust. I chose to take the opportunity of her consinement for my departure, as I knew how ill I could support taking a personal leave, where tears, faintings, and hysterics would effectually unbend my best resolutions. I therefore entrusted my letter to the sister, without-informing her of the contents, and set forward immediately for London. I had not been in town above a fortnight, when one morning, as I sat at breakfast, I heard a chaise stop at the door, and in a moment Clara rushed into the parlour where I was sitting. Good God,” said I, “Mrs. Millar what has brought you to town.”—“What,” she replied, “what but your cruel defertion of me. Unkind, ungenerous Rooksby, did you think I would live separated from you.” —“My dear Clara,,' said I, “consider how your reputation will suffer when this rash step is known”—“What is reputation to me,” cried she, “if I am deprived of your love I lose all that can make life valuable.” —“Where are your children, Clara,”— “I left them too, for your sake, Rooksby; and is this cold, unkind reception all the return I am likely to meet.”—“You call me cold, and unkind; but believe me, you wrong me, I feel all, nay much more than I ought for you, but I am very sorry to find you have so little regard for yourself as thus to incur the censure of the world by following a man who has it not in his power to offer you an honorable protection.”—“You throw me from you, then. You will not receive me” (cried she, starting up, and wildly clasping her hands,) Oh Rooksby this is more than I can bear—I am bursting— My heart is swollen so large; it choaks me. —“Be calm, I beseech you, my dear Clara, I do not refuse to receive you; no, my poor girl, I feel myself bound to protect you; for I know it was I first drew you from your duty; but I am sensible, how little recompence it is in my power to make for the many comforts and blessings I have robbed you of.” “Oh Rooksby,” said she, “let me enjoy your society, and be blessed with your love, and I shall not regret any sacrifice I have made.” What could I do, Miss Howard, continued Mr. Rooksby.—There was but one way. I offered to take her a house a little way out of town and visit her occasionally. She acceded to the proposal and changed her name. Soon after her sister came to town, and with her brought the two children, whom she said Mr. Millar had in his resentment turned out of doors.—I now considered myself as bound to provide for these unfortunate children; but I had no idea of making myself a resident in the same house with their mother. But when I went over to France this last autumn, she followed me, and with such earnestness declared she would sooner die than be separated from me for one week, that I was unable to refuse the request she made to accompany me abroad. While we were on the continent we heard from her sister, that Mr. Millar was dead.—From that time, Clara earnestly pressed me to marry her; but I told her not to form any such vain expectation, as that was an event, which never could take place; however I promised always to be her friend, and in consideration of her then evident pregnancy, consented that on our return to England, I would take a house in London and reside with her.— Alas! my dear young lady, I knew not what inconveniencies I was bringing upon myself: —Her expences far outran the annual sum I had allotted her; she is never happy but when I am with her, and even when I devote almost my whole time to her, she is peevish, dissatisfied and constantly complaining of my altered carriage towards her. Alas, I know I am changed; but I am also certain I never failed in tender solicitude, and attention to her welfare. I never did love her. Vanity, gratitude, and the wild impulses of youth have been mistaken for that passion. I am now convinced of my error. My heart now vibrates with a true and ardent affection. I will never suffer Clara to know want; but the future B 2 happiness or misery of my life must depend entirely upon Miss Howard. I had listened attentively, during this recital. I found much to blame in Clara. Indeed, they had both been guilty of errors of such magnitude, that in my opinion they deserved the appellation of crimes: but it was not for me to condemn. I knew from fatal experience, how imprudent were the dictates of a youthful heart. And though I felt a secret horror at the recital of Rooksby's cruel perfidy, to his kind, unsuspecting friend Mr. Millar, yet he appeared innocent in comparison with Clara. Her husband loved her almost to adoration; he had raised her from poverty to affluence; he had cheared the last hours of her father, and offered an assylum to her orphan sister. He was the father of her children, Celia. Yet could she ungratefully betray the honour he had confided to her care; forsake this kind, indulgent husband, desert her innocent children, in that helpless state, when they require all a mother's fond solicitude and anxious maternal care.—And for this inhuman conduct she pleads love. Celia! real love never yet incited its votaries to base or dishonourable actions. I am certain, I never could like Clara. She appears to me an artful designing woman, and from Rooksby's account, I think, interest has been the main spring of her actions. Indeed, that alone urged her to follow him; for had she regarded him with real affection, she would have shrunk from the idea of becoming a burthen to him: and do not, my dear Celia, think I am turning rigidly censorious, if I say, I suspect she was not really the wife of Mr. Millar; though that takes but little from her guilt, as she certainly had received many tokens of affection from him, and had been received and respected as his wife by all the families who lived in their neighbourhood. All these reflections had passed rapidly thro' my mind, while Mr. Rooksby was speaking. When he paused, I found myself necessitated to answer. “You say, sir, your heart is very deceitful: it has once betrayed you into actions and connections you now heartily repent. May it not do so again. Trust not to its impulse: call in the aid of reason and reflection, and you will find your present inclination will prove as great a delusion as the former.” “Impossible!” he replied, vehemently, “impossible, I can never alter my opinion in regard to Miss Howard.” “And believe me, sir,” said I, gravely, “it is equally impossible I can ever alter mine in regard to you.” I then attempted to leave the room; but he caught my hand. “Stay, my dear girl, only one moment; let me intreat you, only to recall that cruel word never. Give me but the most distant ray of hope and I will endeavor to be satisfied.”—“Well, Sir,” said I smiling, “if you remain of the same opinion you are now, forty years hence, I will talk with you further on the subject.” He released my hand and turned from me in sullen silence. I embraced the opportunity, and immediately quitted the appartment. But here was a fresh scene of persecution to encounter. Mrs. Rooksby met me, as I went across the hall, and taking hold of my arm, we walked into the garden. “I see, my dear Meriel,” said she, “you are not pleased; poor Clement has little to hope: but come tell me, have you given him a positive refusal?”—My dear Madam, you already know my sentiments on that subject, I have no inclination for matrimony, I wish to remain single; for I am certain I should never have patience sufficient to submit to all the whims and caprices of those lords of the creation. “I am afraid Meriel, you deceive yourself, and that under the idea of a disinclination for marriage, you nourish a hopeless and destructive passion. I know my dear girl how nobly you have conducted yourself in regard to Mr. Kingly. My niece has informed me of the whole: but my good girl, while you are thus studiously promoting the happiness of others, why neglect your own, why sacrifice the bloom and spring of life to a passion, which however well placed, is now no longer innocent.” “Oh! Madam,” I replied, “do not suspect me of cherishing so improper a desire; can I not be suffered to pass quietly through the remainder of my life, without forming any other connection than friendship? Why must I be obliged to undertake duties I am so very unable to perform? Or why do you wish a heart long since dead to pleasure, from whom every tender tie is now severed, to have its sensibility again awakened, to have new affections; to make it again fond of life, only perhaps to experience again the acute pangs of losing the beloved objects that had called those affections forth?”—“My dear Meriel, you must not argue thus; we are all born to encounter trouble.”—“Alas! Madam, my share has already been almost beyond my weak power to support; for from the day in which I left the Convent till the present, I have not experienced one so happy that I could wish it to return, yet heaven knows I do not complain; but I wish not to engage in new scenes.” “You must consider, Miss Howard, it is not for us to mark out the path we wish to tread, and cry I will not deviate from it. We are not sent into the world to pass thro' it in indolence. Remember my love that life which is not in some measure serviceable to our fellow-creatures, is not acceptable to our Creator. You in particular are sent into the world, endowed with abilities to shine in the respective characters of Wife, Mother, and the mistress of a family, and will you be the unprofitable servant and hide those talents intrusted to your care, for the comfort of your friends and the benefit of mankind in general”— “But Clara, madam. I hope you will allow that is an obstacle?”—“It is only so in your opinion: To me it is the great motive of my earnest wish to see Clement united to you—Clara shall be amply provided for”— “And her child?”—“We will take it home, should it be born alive, and I will see it shall be properly educated and a handsome provision made for its future support. Now my dear Meriel, I think all your objections are removed.” “You must, dear madam, give me time for consideration, before I can determine on so important a subject.” “You shall not be hurried, my love, only let me have your leave to bid Clement hope.” “Oh! do not I beseech you, raise fallacious hopes. It may not be in my power to realize them.”—“Well then,” said she, “I will remain silent, till I have your leave to speak.” She then turned into another walk and I returned to the house.—“And, now my dear Celia, how would you advise me to act. I fear, turn which way I will, I am still in an error. Ah! my sweet friend, I cannot teach this stubborn heart indifference toward Kingly, and sure I am, whilst I remain single, my partiality will be ever the same. Should I marry, other ties and the important duties of my station will call my mind from this dangerous object: But then to give my hand and vow obedience to a man, whom my heart refuses to love, is certainly an error; and what is worse, the irrevocable words, once past, there will be no flying from my fate, however repugnant it may be to my feelings. I will write to my dear Amelia on the subject; also to to Mrs. Kingly. Their opinions shall decide my fate. Yet, my dear Celia, believe me, my soul shrinks from an union with Rooksby. I know not why, but whenever I think of it, a cold chill runs through my veins, and my heart sinks within me: but I am grown strangely fanciful of late. I am greatly altered since we parted. Methinks, I am but the shadow of my former self, the serenity of temper I once boasted to enjoy is entirely lost, and I am like a froward child. Adieu, I am changed in every thing but friendship to you. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XLI. MERIEL to CELIA. Oak-hall, June 14th, 1781. I have wrote to my friends and received their answers. Amelia wishes me to accept Mr. Rooksby's offer. She says it is the only way to restore tranquility to my heart. Mrs. Kingly desires me to study my own happiness, but at the same time, I think she would rejoice in my union with her cousin. But I will give you both their letters, and you will better conceive how their minds are inclined.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III. C LETTER XLII. MRS. KINGLY to MISS HOWARD. Plymouth, June 4th, 1781. You tell me, my dear Miss Howard, that my cousin has, to your surprize, declared a passion for you: it is your diffidence alone occasions that surprize, as I foresaw it was a circumstance that would certainly follow your residing in the family: but, though my lovely friend, I should greatly rejoice to rank you in the number of my relations, I would by no means desire that gratification, if it is to be purchased at the expence of your peace of mind.— Clement has, it is true, an independent fortune; but his mind is not formed for the approbation of one so delicate as yours. I should be pleased to see you raised to a station you was formed to adorn; but I cannot avoid the remembrance of your gentleness of spirit which seeks not in grandeur for content. Oh! my dear Meriel, I know there never was but one man worthy of your affection, and I have stepped between you and happiness. I informed Mr. Kingly, as you desired, of my cousin's offer. “Her mind,” said he, “must be strangely altered, if she can find the least congenial particle in his; but she is altogether an inexplicablee riddle.” Vexed to hear him speak so slightingly, I was almost tempted to betray my trust and tell him how vilely you had slandered yourself, but shall I confess the truth, self-love prevailed. I could not bear to think he might perhaps be angry at my long concealment; and much as I esteem and venerate my dear Miss Howard, I could not consent he should love even her, better than me. I will not give my opinion concerning your future conduct; though you condescend to ask it. Of this I am satisfied, whatever your own good sense shall resolve upon, that will undoubtedly be right. Accept my best wishes for your happiness and prosperity, and belive you have not a sincerer friend than M. KINGLY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XLIII. MISS SIDNEY to MISS HOWARD. London, June 3d, 1781. And so my little sentimental Meriel is really and seriously deliberating, whether she shall accept a man with seven thousand a year, shine forth in all the magnificence of bridal finery, or remaining a chaste vestal, breathing pure vows to the consecrated flame of her first love, continue in a state of dependence to the end of her life. I charge you, Miss Howard, deliberate no longer. Make haste and send us some wedding favours, and next winter, let me have the pleasure of pointing out your elegant equipage, as it passes my window, to some of my inquisitive acquaintance, and saying, “that is my friend Mrs. Rooksby's carriage. Then how shall I exult to receive a curtesy from a side box when you are as fine as hands can make you, and poor humble me as plain as possible, sit almost opposite you in the pit. In the pit you say, bless me Amelia, I should blush to death to be thought to know any one in the pit. Pardon me, dear Meriel, I know your good little heart so well, I am certain the friend you esteemed would always be recognized while she continued deserving of your notice, though poverty and distress were strongly marked by her appearance. And now to be serious concerning your letter, Mr. Rooksby appears to me a weak young man; but there seems great goodness of heart in him and I think it would be a charitable action to snatch him from ruin.—for inevetable ruin must follow his connection with Clara. I am informed her stile of living is the most extravagant immaginable, and such splendid preparations are making for her accouchment, that you would think her a dutchess of the first rank. And now I am speaking of charitable actions, let me represent to my friend the many aching hearts it will be in her power to relieve when she is mistress of such an ample fortune, as Mr. Rooksby offers to her acceptance. And again, my love, consider what a relief it will be to the generous Mrs. Kingly to see you so well settled. Even Kingly himself will be happier when you are married, for trust me while you remain single he will nourish the idea that your partiality for him is the occasion C 2 of your preferring a state of celibacy.— That you will be happier in yourself, I am well convinced. New scenes will open to your imagination, past sorrows will be forgotten and the afflictions of the daughter shall be amply repaid by the felicity of the mother. Ah! my dear Meriel, you must marry, if it be only to experience the superlative happiness of having a daughter, whose soul shall be the exact model of your own. Methinks too, my friend, you will feel your bosom dilate with pleasure, when you can call Mrs. Rooksby by the endearing name of mother. A heart like yours, so formed for all the endearing ties of life when deprived of its natural relation, seeks some one on whom to rest its affection. Accept then my dear girl, the offered good that awaits you, let your heart expand to receive all those delightful sensations which result from a felicitous matrimonial union, and while you are alternately addressed by the endearing titles of mother and daughter; while the man whom you shall bless with your hand, reveres, admires, adores you, the disappointments of your youth shall be no more remembered, except it is with a kind of smiling wonder at their ever having made you uneasy. My mother bids me tell you she wishes you may be as truly happy as you deserve, and you will then be superlatively so—and so says your AMELIA SIDNEY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MERIEL to CELIA. IN CONTINUATION. When I had read these letters, my mind still wavering and irresolute, I repaired to Mrs. Rooksby's dressing room. I found her weeping. “Meriel,” said she, as I entered, “you are come in good time to comfort me. Clement has just been with me. He leaves us to-morrow.” “To-morrow, Madam, that is much sooner than he at first intended.” “Yes, Meriel, and he leaves us with an intention that almost deprives me of reason.” “You surprize me, what intention can he have formed, that gives you so much anxiety.” “He is determined to marry Clara immediately on his arrival in London, that his child may be legetimated.” “Marry Clara,” said I, with an emotion of astonishment. “It is even so my dear; he just now told me he found it was in vain to hope any thing from you, and being deprived of the hope of your affection he knew love could have no part in any other union, he was determined that the claims of honour should be attended to, and his innocent child have not future cause to curse the author of its being, since that being would, if he did not marry Clara, inherit infamy as its birth-right.” “I cannot think,” I replied, “that honour by any means obliges him to marry that woman. She certainly forfeited all claim to an honourable protector, when she fled from Mr. Millar. I wish she was well provided for, and far from Mr. Rooksby, for I am cartain that inevitable misery and ruin must ensue from a continuation of his present connection with her. What then would bethe consequence of an indissoluble union? I tremble to think of it.” “You will see him, Miss Howard, before he leaves Oak-hall. Let me beg of you, my dear girl, to exert all your eloquence, to persuade him from so fatal a step. Give some hope, even if it should be but fallacious, and I make no doubt, but we shall retain him with us a little time longer, and who knows what time may do.” “I cannot deceive any person, my dear madam. If I am tempted to hold out hope to draw your son from this destructive resolution, be assured, I shall one day mean to realize them.”—“Blessings on you my sweet Meriel, you will then relent; I shall have the happiness of seeing my son preserved from ruin, and obtain a daughter who must be admired and esteemed by all, who are so happy as to know her.” “I did not absolutely say so, madam. I will see Mr. Rooksby previous to his intended departure. I will use every argument in my power to prevail with him to give up his design in regard to Clara; if I find every other argument ineffectual, I will promise some future day to give him my hand. But let me request my dear friendly Mrs. Rooksby to attribute this resolution to its proper cause. I will not deceive your son with professions of affection which I do not feel. I have received many favours from you and your amiable niece Mrs. Kingly, and I think it will be to your mutual satisfaction, to see me married. I am sensible, it is a duty also which I owe myself, as, whilst I continue single, I shall always be suspected of nourishing an improper affection for Mr. Kingly, and as it is my earnest wish to preserve my own reputation unfullied and to promote as much as possible the happiness of others, I will unite myself to Mr. Rooksby, but alas, I have nothing to offer in return for his generous affection but esteem and friendship.” “Enough my love,” cried Mrs. Rooksby embracing me, “I have no doubt of Clement's happiness, when blest with the esteem of so amiable a companion.” At dinner we all met as usual. Mr. Rooksby was in his travelling dress. “Are you for riding this afternoon, sir,” said I—“I think of setting forward for London, Miss Howard, I have an affair of infinite consequence to transact there, and I fear delays may be dangerous.”—“You must not leave us to-night, however, Clement,” said his mother smiling. —“I did not understand you intended leaving Oak-hall till to-morrow,” said I.—“I would willingly stay here for ever,” he replied, “but I am sensible my presence is detrimental to the tranquility of one whose happiness I would promote at the hazard of my life.” —This was a compliment, my dear Celia, which I could not take entirely to myself, as he might have meant Clara's happiness was disturbed by his remaining at Oak-hall, I therefore remained silent, and little more was said, till the cloth was removed. I then arose to leave the room with Mrs. Rooksby, who generally retires to her dressing room after dinner, and as if often the case with elderly people, indulges herself with a nap. As I arose Mr. Rooksby took my hand. “Permit me, Miss Howard, before I take my leave to request the honour of a few minutes conversation.” I curtesied assent and reassumed my seat; he continued. “It is with infinite regret, my dear young lady, that I leave this place, as by so doing I relinquish every hope, which I had fondly cherished of obtaining an interest in your bosom. I see my presence is painful to you, it encroaches on that tranquillity you would otherwise enjoy, in a place so agreeable to your disposition. I hope you will believe, your happiness is an object of far greater moment to me than my own. I go from hence with a fixed resolution to repair the injuries I have done Clara; but to convince you how near your interest is and ever will be to my heart, I must beg you will consider yourself from this moment independent. In this (presenting me a small box) you will find a writing, which conveys to you and yours for ever an estate worth two hundred pounds a year, situated in Glamorganshire. I will not be either interrupted or contradicted (seeing I was about to speak.) You must accept this as from a brother, who though his own future days will have scarce a dawn of pleasure to enliven them, will always have the comfort of reflecting the most amiable woman in the world will be no more reduced to situations at once so unworthy her merits, and painful to her feelings.” Overcome by this generous conduct I was unable to speak. Tears involuntarily burst from my eyes and seeing him about to leave the room, almost unknowing what I did, I caught his hand to detain him.— “Do not distress me, my dear Miss Howard, said he, those tears are too precious to be shed on such a trivial occasion.” “Trivial,” said I, “Oh! Mr. Rooksby, I cannot accept this noble donation. It oppresses me beyond measure. I have no way of discharging the vast debt of gratitude.” “My sweet girl,” said he, kissing my hand. “Remember me ever with a friendly affection and I shall think myself a thousand times repaid.” “I cannot take it, sir, indeed I cannot. But let me prefer one request to you. Do not leave us this afternoon, remain a few days longer to oblige me.”— No, my dear Meriel, I see the generous drift of your design. You pity me, you wish to make me happy and to oblige my mother would sacrifice your own felicity; but, my dear friend, if I have nothing to hope from affection, I will not be indebted to gratitude or compassion. “But, dear Mr. Rooksby, consider how you will distress your mother by thus precipitately giving your hand to Mrs. Millar; You must pardon me, sir, but indeed I do not think her altogether worthy such an honour.” “Such a severe expression from miss Howard is something extraordinary; but vol. iii. D women (added he smiling) are not always the most candid judges of each other. You my dear Miss behold in Clara only a frail woman, who forgetful of the rigid dictates of honour and virtue sacrificed reputation, friends, every valuable consideration to an unhappy passion. I behold her as a lovely, unfortunate creature, who has made those sacrifices for me. I also consider that, perhaps, had it been her fate to be united to the man of her heart, she would at this moment have been a respectable member of society; and if I reflect, that I only am the cause, that she is not so, can I do otherwise than repair as much, as is in my power, the injuries her reputation has suffered on my account.” “I think, Mr. Rooksby, you argue perfectly right, nor should I have entered on this subject, had it not been at the earnest request of your mother. She shudders at the idea of your introducing into the family a woman of light fame. She has been informed that Mrs. Millar is a very faulty woman in more respects than one. She wishes to have her amply provided for, but cannot endure to think she must be the wife of her darling son.” “I saw, Miss Howard, from the first that it was at my mother's desire you so chearfully assented to this conversation. She knew the generosity of your disposition. She naturally supposed you would exert yourself to prevail with me to relinquish my design. She foresaw the generous concessions you would make in my favour: but she knows not the heart of her son, if she imagines affection like his could be satisfied with any thing less than affection in return.” “I am sorry, I shall be able to give no better account of my undertaking; but, however, Mr. Rooksby, permit me to decline, this obligation (returning the writings). I am perfectly satisfied with my situation in your mother's family, and must insist on your receiving this again.” He refused to take it. I laid it on the table and hastily left the room. So you see, my dear Celia, while I was consulting my friends whether I should accept or reject this man, he has hastily formed the resolution of leaving me to wear the willow and bestowing himself on another. Seriously my friend I feel myself greatly obliged by the delicate manner in which he declined accepting a hand when he was certain the heart would not immediately follow, and were it not that I fear he will be extremely unhappy in an union with Clara, I should rejoice in being released from his importunities. Mrs. Rooksby is in great affliction. I try all I can to comfort her; but I really believe she will feel as much, when she fees her son mount his horse to leave the Hall, as she would were she attending him to the silent receptacle of his ancestors. When this dreaded wedding is over she will, I make no doubt, feel easier, and the birth of her grandchild will naturally awaken some degree of affection towards its mother. You will, perhaps, my dear Celia, blame, me for so obstinately refusing Mr. Rooksby's generous present; but my dear girl I am the worst in the world to receive an obligation. It oppresses me; it sinks me to the earth, especially when I have no power to return it. While I have my health, I have no doubt of always finding a situation, where I may render myself in some measure useful, in return for my subsistence, and should sickness, age or any infirmity, to which mortality is subject, overtake me, whilst I remain in what is generally termed an unprotected state, I have still the same beneficent Providence to rely on, who never yet suffered me to sink under affliction. Adieu my friend, MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XLII. MERIEL to CELIA. Oak-hall, August 12th, 1781. We have had fine bustling and confusion I assure you, my dear Celia, since I wrote you last; and if you knew all, you would say, we are likely to have much more,—but not to go on with my intelligence too fast. The morning after I concluded my last, Mr. Rooksby set off for London. His mother D 2 would not take leave of him at his departure, and I was obliged to consent that a correspondence should be commenced between us; for she had absolutely declared all intercourse with her must cease, from the moment he married Clara. Accordingly on the fourth day after his departure I received a letter, informing me he had arrived too late for his purpose: for Clara had been in bed two days, and little master was as fine a boy as ever was seen, and in perfect health. Mrs. Rooksby greatly rejoiced, that any thing had happened to postpone the wedding, and flattered herself the connection would by some means or other be broke off. It was near six weeks before we had any farther tidings of him, though I had answered his letter immediately. It was at the close of evening; Mrs. Rooksby was reclined on a sopha; for the weather was extremely hot, and I was playing on the harpsichord which I accompanied with my voice. The evening was remarkably still, the moon with silver crescent saintly illumined the sky, encreasing the beauty of the night by her presence, without eclipsing by too much radience the lesser glories of the stars. I had just begun that charming song from Milton's Penseroso. “Sweet bird that shun'st the noise of folly,“ When we were interrupted by the sound of horses coming up the avenue, and in a few minutes Mr. Rooksby rushed into the room, pale and to all appearance worn out with fatigue. He spoke not at entering, but throwing himself into his mother's arms, burst into tears. “Clement,” said she, “my dear Clement what is the matter. Good God! you weep, your hands are hot. You are very ill.”— “Oh! mother,” he replied, “forgive me. I know it is unlike a man, but the shock I have received.”—“Is Clara dead then,” said she.—“Clara, did you say, Oh the siren, name her not, I cannot trust myself to speak of her, she is—but come we will not talk about her.” “You come upon us rather unexpected,” said I, advancing towards him. “I came,” said he, “as fast as a repeated change of horses would bring me, for I knew there was no other place, where I could find comfort. You, my dear Miss Howard will comfort me, and you will prevail with my mother, to receive under her protecting roof some poor little orphans who will arrive to-morrow to claim her care.” “You are sensible, Clement, that every child of affliction is welcome to me. I will protect and serve them to the utmost of my power. How much greater then will be their claim on my humanity, when they come recommended by you.” “And when one of them is my child,” cried he vehemently,—“my dear mother, that woman, whom I had intended to make my wife—but no matter, she is gone. She has forsaken her poor little innocents; but I will not suffer them to know want.” “You are not married then?”—“No” —“Thank heaven, my dear Clement, thank heaven, your honour will not suffer by this cruel defertion, and let the vile mother go, we will protect the unoffending children.” After supper, Mr. Rooksby was more composed. He told us, that on his arrival in London he hastened to Clara and found her as he had informed us, the mother of a fine boy and likely to do well. He told her with what intention he had hurried to town, and said, if she desired it, a special licence should be procured and the ceremony performed in her own chamber. This she fortunately refused alledging, that, as her disgrace had been public, she desired the reparation might be public also. To this he assented and preparations were making for the public performance of the ceremony. He had presented her with a magnificent set of jewels, and with money to the amount of three thousand pounds. A day was appointed for the union: the articles, settlements, &amp;c. were all ready for signing: When the evening preceding the appointed morning he called at her house and was informed she was gone to a private ball some few miles out of town. He thought it somewhat strange, but knowing the volatility of her disposition and how extremely fond of every thing that wore the semblance of pleasure, it did not so much surprize him. The next morning he repaired to her at the time appointed, a new equipage, servants in new liveries with white and silver favours arrived at the door. The guests began to appear when enquiries were made for the bride.— Mr. Rooksby went up to hasten her. She was not in her dressing-room. He called for her woman: she was not to be found. At length a groom ventured, trembling into the presence of the disappointed, enraged bridegroom and delivered him a sealed billet. He broke the seal with precipitation: it contained these words: TO MR. ROOKSBY. You thought to have deceived me, but you are mistaken. I have been informed of all your late dishonourable conduct. Would your mother's humble companion have accepted your hand, it would never have been offered to me: but though you have been a dupe to me I will not become one to you. I know, you will, at the reception of this, rave and curse your evil genius which has induced you to make yourself the laughing stock of your acquaintance. I am far beyond the reach of your revenge, and enjoy in idea, the ridiculous figure you will, at the moment you are reading this appear, surrounded by your friends decked in the trappings of nuptial finery and deserted by the intended bride. I have left the brats.— They would have been troublesome on the long journey I mean to take; you may either provide for them or send them to the work-house; either way will be equally agreeable to me. I have accepted the protection of a noble lover, and mean to make with him the tour of Europe. You must now offer yourself again to Miss Howard, and I wish she may serve you as I have done. CLARA. It is easy to conceive the passion this infamous scrawl created in the bosom of Rooksby. He was in the first paroxysms of rage for putting an immediate period to his existence. Shame, vexation, and disappointment drove him to the verge of distraction. At length he recollected the child of whom he is extremely fond. He called for it, declared that the mother's guilt should never be revenged on her innocent offspring, and in caressing the little cherub, in some measure composed the perturbation of his spirits. The company dispersed, he sent away his chariot, and returned to his lodging in a hackney-coach, where he undressed and ordering post horses, set forward immediately for Oak-hall, leaving his own man to follow with the nurse and children. The eldest, who is a girl, I am told is at school in a village near Oxford, where Mr. Rooksky has every reason to be satisfied with the care taken of her education and morals. He means, he says, that she shall have a useful education, and will settle on her a thousand pounds, the interest of which is to be appropriated to her support. The two boys, he will bring up together and by a liberal education fit them for one of the genteel professions, the choice of which shall remain with themselves. To them also he will give a thousand pounds each; but they are both to be called by the name of Millar. This is certainly a noble spirited young man. It is a pity he has not more firmness of temper; but he is as weak as an infant and as easily persuaded by persons who rightly understand his disposition. Awaken his gratitude or make a claim upon his honour, and you may lead him as you please. This is far from the kind of temper that I like. Were I ever so much attached to Mr. Rooksby, I should be afraid of professing it, least it should be supposed I meant to take an undue advantage of his easy nature, and I should, if married to such a man, avoid shewing a thousand little kindnesses, least I should seem to demand more than similar attentions from him. There is another trait in his character, which I have lately discovered. He is vain and rather addicted to jealousy; and I can perceive there is no part of Clara's conduct hurts him more severely, than finding her so totally indifferent—and when he imagined her strongly attached to himself, to know her capable of eloping with another. And yet, my dear Celia, this very man with all his errors, they have some how or other among them drawn me into a sort of promise to marry. Mrs. Kingly wrote and my dear Amelia wrote too.—Mrs. Rooksby pleaded, and Clement himself, looked such eloquent things, that what with the grateful remembrance of his generosity, toward me, which I forgot to tell you his mother insisted on my accepting, and a sort of pity for his late disappointment, I experienced a kind of sentiment which I know not how to distinguish. It is more lively than esteem, and yet I am sure it is not love. However, be it what it may, the die is cast, and I believe Rooksby will be the man with whom I am destined to pass my life. The settlements, &amp;c. prepared for Clara, his mother declares shall remain for me, as blanks had been left for the names. I do not agree to this point; as I think the settlement by far too large. I think it very necessary a proper provision should be made in case of a large family, but as I have no fortune, it would be unjust as well as ungerous to accept a settlement of seven hundred a year. This I am resolved to over rule.— Three hundred will be more than sufficient. On this condition alone, will I give him my hand, for it shall never be said the poor Meriel Howard aggrandized herself at the expence of the Rooksby family. For here are ill natured people in all families and no doubt many of Mr. Rooksby's relations will think themselves degraded by this alliance. VOL. III. E In about a month from this time, my dear friend, my fate will be decided. Contrary to my inclination, the old lady will have a public wedding, and all the family to the third and fourth generation are to be invited. The old mansion is put into such a commotion: here is such fitting up and pulling down, with such wife and busy faces, popping about from one apartment to another, while I, who am the cause of all the confusion, am as calm and composed as possible. At least, my countenance and demeanor say so; but I have many serious thoughts, and many a tear and many a sigh is given to the memory of the time when I looked forward to the nuptial hour with different sensations; but that must be forgotten. My dear Celia, pray for for your MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XLIII. MERIEL to CELIA. Oak-hall, Sept. 20th, 1781. It is past, my friend—and I am now the wife of Mr. Rooksby. It is just a week, since at the altar, I pledged my faith to love and honour him to the latest period of his existence. Well Celia, I will keep this vow most religiously; at least I will esteem him and love no other, and whilst his conduct is such as demands honour, I will honour him. Should he ever fail in any of the grand moral duties, I will bear it with meekness, pity him and endeavour to reclaim him. I will be a faithful wife in every sense of the word. The day on which I gave him my hand, was indeed to me a tremendous one.— Kingly was present, nay he even gave me to his cousin. I trembled when he took my hand, a saint sickish sensation come over me: but I rallied my spirits and went through the ceremony tolerably well. My dear Amelia, whom you might suppose would be present on this important occasion, kept up my spirits during the rest of the day. Mrs. Kingly looked happy, but it was a kind of satisfaction tempered with fear.—“I hope” said she,” pressing my hand, “I hope the æra of your felicity may be dated from this propitious day.”—“Most certainly it will,” cried Amelia, “for who ever heard of misery in a coach and six.”—“Oh!” replied Mrs. Kingly, with great energy, “there is much greater misery in them than those who lack the goods of fortune will readily imagine, aye, my dear Miss Sidney, and the worst kind of misery too, such as wealth cannot relieve or grandeur alleviate.” “Well,” said Amelia, laughing, “I declare we have chosen a brilliant topic for a wedding day, but pray let us change it. I was always more inclined to become a disciple of the laughing, rather than the weeping philosopher.” When it drew near dinner time and I found I must descend into the drawing room, I trembled from the idea of being presented to about half a hundred strangers, who would compliment, and criticise at a most unmerciful rate; the one to my face, the other behind my back, and believe me I would sooner listen to the latter than the former: for compliments have in general little or no meaning and of course are mere insipid trifles. Now in listening to the criticisms of our friendly neighbours, who perhaps did not intend we should over hear them, we discover our faults, and may learn how to amend them; but the misfortune is, few will take the trouble to point out our errors to us, while every one is ready to flatter our self love, by commending us for qualifications to which we have little or no pretensions, and, if they think, we believe their assertions, the moment we quit them they will laugh at our credulity. Well! my dear Celia, I never could bring myself to make compliments, or fine speeches to people, whom I did not think deserved them. But to return to my subject— I got through the day tolerably well, and now our guests begin to think of returning to their respective homes. It is proposed, that we stay at Oak-hall till the latter end of November. Mrs. Rooksby has prevailed on Mrs. Sidney to remain with her, during the winter, while Amelia accompanies me to town. I am vastly pleased with the arrangement, as the society of that dear girl E 2 will be a great comfort to me. I find Rooksby has given orders for a house to be fitted up in a stile of the utmost elegance, as he intends we shall always pass the winters in town and the summers with his mother at the Hall. He talks of much grandeur and gaity. I am sorry for it, I think his taste very expensive; but it is not my place to speak. I am determined to regulate my own expences, by the strict rule of economy, void of parsimony. Even was the wealth my own, I have no right to squander it away in unnecessary trifles, and as it is not, I must be still more careful. My allowance for pocket money, cards, &amp;c. is extremely liberal, and I hope always to order it in such a manner as to have a sufficient sum by me, to assist depressed merit, or rescue suffering innocence from oppression. I hope, my dear Celia, elevated as my present situation is, I shall never forget the useful lessons taught me in the school of adversity; and surely, whilst the remembrance of my own sufferings are retained, my heart will never be rendered callous to the sufferings of others. Oh! my beloved friend, dearly indeed should I purchase the smiles of fortune, if I am to lose my humanity. Benificent Ruler of the Universe, teach me to value the blessings bountifully showered upon me, by constantly remembering my own deserts; and whenever I meet an afflicted fellow-creature, let my heart shew its gratitude to Thee, by dropping the tear of sympathy, and granting the tribute of relief.”—I am certain, Celia, they who have never known adversity, cannot truly enjoy prosperity. I forgot to tell you, that Kingly left us the day after we were married. Mrs. Kingly stays, till we all go to London. When we are settled there, I will write you again; but you must not expect any great variety in my letters; I must, I suppose, at first enter into the gaities of the metropolis, but I am determined not to be so infatuated as to give up my whole time to them. I will have my hours of peace and retirement: for in my opinion the life that is spent in a continued round of insipid pleasures, is not only entirely useless to society, but in some measure guilty, as we can have no time for the performance of those duties, which are incumbent on every professor of Christianity; nor do I think as many do, that people of a certain rank in life may pass their time in any way most agreeable to themselves, and that they are not accountable for it to any one. We certainly are answerable to one, who will demand an account of our stewardship at a time, when no evasion whatever will serve our turn: and the more elevated our station, the more careful we should be to set examples worthy the imitation of our inferiors. Examples that may inspire all, who know us with a love of virtue, be an honour to ourselves, and a benefit to society in general. Mr. Rooksby asked me, to whom I was writing. To the friend of my early days, I replied. We were educated in the same convent. Miss Shelburne chose to take the veil—I was of a different religion, and have been called into the busy scenes of life, but the affections of our youth are always remembered with peculiar pleasure; especially, when reason approves the election our hearts had made in the days of childhood. I am certain, my dear Meriel, said he, she must be amiable, or she would not be honoured with your esteem. You are a flatterer, said, I smiling, but if you knew Celia half so well as I do, you would know she was worthy of the love of every good heart. I will not repeat his reply, my friend, as it would favour too much of vanity, if he is as gallant and tender twelve months hence, I may perhaps, stand a good chance for claiming the flitch of bacon. He bids me present his best wishes to you. Amelia also requests to be remembered; but it is impossible that either of them can love and esteem you with the tenderness and sincerity of MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XLIV. MERIEL to CELIA. Harley St. Dec. 19th, 1781. I have been in town above a week; but could not command an hour to devote to friendship and Celia. Indeed, I have been so taken up with mantua-makers, milliners and toymen, I hardly know what account to give of the last seven days; then what with here and there a particular friend, who requested to be admitted, before my appearance at court gave the signal for the whole town to come and pass their opinion on my house-furniture, &amp;c. I have been wearied to death with a constant succession of impertinant visitors, who are thus over polite, for no other reason than the eager desire they have to report the discoveries they make in regard to my person, dress and manner, to the whole circle of their acquaintance; but in this they have been sadly disappointed, for I have received them all in a small back drawing-room, and have never yet varied my dress from a neat dishabille. I am now summoned to the drawing room: some new set of inquisitives, I suppose, well, I must attend; for people of fashion live not for themselves, but others. They are afraid to perform any action, if unfashionable, though ever so right, least they should be laughed at: and for the very same cause dare not refuse to do any thing to which fashion gives a sanction, though reason tells them it is wrong, and should be avoided. I must leave you Celia. And who do you imagine my visitors were? Now would I venture to lay a considerable wager, your mind would glance over the whole circle of my acquaintance, without being able to guess the right. So to save you the trouble of conjecture, I will at once inform you. They were no other than my kind aunt Mossopand her two amiable daughters. I do declare, Celia, when I saw them in the drawing room I absolutely blushed for them. However, they did not seem to experience any embarrassment; but paid their compliments with the same easy air, as if nothing had ever interrupted our intimacy; only with this difference, their language and manner was more respectful. “You have been very sly, my dear,” said my aunt, “never to let us know where you were all this time, and then to blaze upon us all at once a splendid bride.” “I thought, madam, after the death of my father, you would feel but little interested about the fate of his daughter, for whom you never appeared to have any great degree of partiality.” “Bless me, Mrs. Rooksby, you are vastly mistaken. I was always extremely partial to you, and I am sure Hester and Susan have talked of you many times, since last we had the pleasure of seeing you. We wondered what had become of you.” “I have seen a variety of scenes,” said I, “nor would it have been in the least probable should meet with so advantageous a settlement as I have, had it not been for the friendship of a young lady, whom I have once or twice seen at your house, and who at present does me the honour to make one of my family.” I then rang the bell, and desired the servant to inform Miss Sidney we requested the favour of her company. I saw my cousins look at each other when Amelia's name was mentioned, Mrs. Mossop changed countenance. “Bless me,” said Hester, “I was thinking of Miss Sidney, the other day: but we have been in town so very little while, we have seen nobody—this is positively the first visit we have made.” When Amelia entered the room, I saw she was astonished: I also saw the constraint and confusion which my visitors vainly endeavoured to hide under the mask of extreme pleasure at the accidental meeting. However, as I imagined, my cousins courted my notice merely in the hope of sometimes being of my parties, and throwing themselves in the way of men of rank and fortune, I gave them a general invitation to my house, and I sincerely wish the event may answer their sanguine expectations, as it would give me great satisfaction to see them married to worthy men, possessed of fortunes capable of supporting them in the manner to which they have been accustomed, and which I fear they could not continue, was their father to die before they are settled; as he could not leave them a large fortune, having in general lived up to the extent of his income. Young Mossop is, I find, in the West-Indies.—Is it not strange, my dear Celia, that I have heard nothing of my brother these two years past. However he has forgot me. I often think of him; I pray for his health and prosperity, and should rejoice to see him return with an independence sufficient to place him in a respectable situation.—Oh Celia, this continual round of visitors, by no means suits the taste of your friend. I am called away again. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">vol. iii. F LETTER XLV.[1] [1] Between this and the preceding letter, several are omited, as they contained only the common events of life. During this time Mrs. Rooksby informs her friend she is become the mother of a daughter. The reader may therefore suppose, more than a year and a half has clapsed, since the marriage of our heroine. MERIEL to CEILA. Oak-hall, June 10th, 1783. My little Clementina, is grown the finest girl you can imagine; and I assure you, grandmamma is not a little proud of her darling. I wished the dear little charmer to have been called Frederica, but I dared not say so, least it should be thought improper. Last night, my dear Amelia arrived: her spirits are greatly depressed by the death of her excellent mother, but as she will be happy in the friendship and protection of Mrs. Rooksby, I hope soon to see her chearfulness restored. I have got such a habit of seizing every leisure moment to scribble to my Celia, that I often take up my pen, when I have really nothing to say. You rejoice, you tell me to find my happiness increase. Indeed, my dear friend I experience a much larger share than some years since, I could have imagined would have ever fallen to my lot. Mr. Rooksby is still the kind, the attentive husband, and the birth of my little girl seems more strongly to cement our union. You cannot think, how surprised I was a few days before we left town. Mr. Rooksby had been out in the morning, and on his return told me he had met with an old friend whom he had invited home to dinner.” He is a man,” said he, “with whom I formed an acquaintance when we were both boys at the same school together, I have not seen him for some time, but I always thought him a worthy fellow, and am now happy in the renewal of our intimacy.” He did not mention the name of his friend. You may judge therefore what was my astonishment, when just before dinner a servant announced Mr. Belger. I know not why it was, but I felt myself strangely embarrassed while he was paying his compliments. Mr. Belger too was surprised, and looked abashed at the unexpected rencounter, for I had not seen him since the cold wet night when we parted at the end of Kensington. However, I immediately accosted him by name and turning to Mr. Rooksby endeavoured at a smile, while I said, “This is an old acquaintance of mine too, though I dare say Mr. Belger had not the most distant idea of seeing me here.” I then enquired after Mrs. Belger and Emma. “Emma is abroad in a convent, madam,” he replied—“and, her mother”—He hesitated, and I at that moment perceiving he was dressed in second mourning, instantly understood his meaning. I felt my eyes fill. I remembered her gentleness and affection, and I also remembered how ill that affection had been requited. “And pray, my dear,” said Mr. Rooksby, “where were you acquainted with my friend Belger?”—“At Kensington,” I replied.— “At Kensington!” said he with visible emotion “Did you know many persons there.” “Very few, indeed; for at that time I was not in a situation to receive many visitants.” I did not choose, my dear Celia, to mention having known Mrs. Moreton; as she was undoubtedly a woman of light character, the being supposed, an intimate of such a woman, would by no means contribute to raise me in Mr. Rooksby's opinion, I therefore endeavoured to give the conversation a different turn, and dinner being soon after announced, it assisted my design, and we spoke afterwards only on indifferent subjects.—I am by no means pleased with Belger's being on an intimate footing in our family, he is not a proper companion for Rooksby, I am certain he is of libertine principles, fond of gaming and dissipated in his manners, yet greatly as I dislike him, I dare not mention it to Mr. Rooksby, as he seems extremely fond of him and places the most implicit confidence in his honour, and has actually invited him to pass some weeks this summer with us here, I am mortified and vexed, Amelia laughs at me, when I mention my anxiety and says, he will now be fearful of insulting me by any mention of his love. While I was unprotected he could treat me with disrespect, without fear of being called to an account, now it is quite a different affair.—Indeed, Celia, this is not what I dread, but I think if Mr. Rooksby should by any means hear how intimate we once were, he would be displeased, and it might be the cause of great uneasiness between us, I shall take particular care to avoid all opportunities of being entertained alone by this F 2 man, and feel happy in the reflection that while I am in the country I shall have Amelia constantly with me. 22d. Since I began my letter I have been so agitated and distressed I found myself totally unequal to the task of finishing it. Now I have sat down for that purpose, I hardly know how to arrange the extraordinary events that have happened within these last twelve days, nor am I certain that you, my dear Celia, will entirely approve of my conduct; yet sure you will not greatly condemn me: for your gentle heart is benevolence itself. On the evening of the day on which I began my letter, I could not but observe that Mr. Rooksby was extremely thoughtful and grave, a thing with him very uncommon, as his usual demeanor is chearful, and his conversation lively.—Once or twice, I thought (for I observed him narrowly,) I saw the tears start in his eyes, he sighed deeply and often. His mother remarked his want of spirits and inquired if he was well. His answer was, “yes madam, very well, but rather out of spirits, I shall be better to-morrow, do not pay any attention to it.”—I thought it was best not to speak, least urgent inquiries might encrease rather than relieve his evident depression; and in case any family affair had occasioned his uneasiness I was sensible he would not choose to mention it before his mother and Amelia.—I therefore determined to let it rest, if he thought it right that I should be informed of the cause, he would the first convenient opportunity communicate it; if not, it would I naturally supposed only increase his vexation to be teized with impertinent inquiries. When we retired he spoke but little, seemed buried in thought, and I am certain, slept little all night. This was too much—I felt my heart partake of his uneasiness, though I was ignorant of its origin. I longed to lighten his anxiety by participation;— Yet, feared to be troublesome.—After breakfast perceiving his dejection rather increase than diminish, I followed him into the shrubbery, and finding him sitting in a melancholy, musing posture, seated myself beside him, and laying my hand on his arm, said with a voice, that evidently spoke my tender solicitude— “Rooksby you are not happy.” “I am not, indeed, my dear Meriel, I am very far from it; but do not let it interrupt your tranquillity. The cause of my present dejection will soon be removed, and then I shall again enjoy with pleasure the society of the best of wives; but at present, my love, I must request you to leave me, as I am unfit for conversation.” “And can you, Rooksby, think me worthy of the flattering appelation you just now gave me, and yet suppose me capable of preserving my tranquillity while I see you unhappy.” “You know, my sweet girl, I think you all, that is good and amiable in woman, and it is for your peace of mind I would endeavour to hide my unhapiness.” “But as you connot hide it from the eye of affection, then refuse me not the pleasure, my dear Rooksby of at least participating. If I cannot alleviate your anxiety, surely you cannot fear to place a confidence in the chosen friend of your heart.” “Oh no! but I know it will give you no pleasure to be informed, nay, I fear it would rather make you unhappy in an eminent degree.” “Then it is something of great consequence either to your honour or interest, or perhaps to both: if so, I must one day know it, and sure the tidings will not give me so much pain from you, as from the lips of another.” “Oh! my gentle love, do not press me, you have no idea of what my heart at this moment suffers, while I refuse to gratify your laudable curiosity. Yes, my dear Meriel—I know the only incentive to be thus pressing, is a generous wish to relieve my anxiety; but believe me, you cannot form the remotest idea of the cause. If you could, you would look on me with a mixture of horror and disgust.” “Say not so, Rooksby; do not think so meanly of your wife as to suppose her capapable of thinking of you a moment without affection, without an ardent wish to see you as perfectly happy, as it is possible for mortal to be.” “Can, my dearest-life, think of no incident that might happen, that would weaken her affection towards me.” “None.—Were it possible, (but I know it not) that forgetful of your vows, you could prove false to your Meriel she could never forget that you had raised her from indigence! that you were her husband! and the father of her child!” “Dearest, best of womankind—false to thee! No—rather should my heart cease to beat. I see your heroic spirit is adequate to any trial; no longer will I keep you in suspense. I have seen Clara.”— “And, is that all!—fye! Rooksby, fye! could you think that would give me a moments pain. Believe me were it in my power to be of the least service to Mrs. Millar, I would instantly fly to do it. “Angelic goodness! but could you indeed forgive her.” “I have no right to call her too account, my dear Rooksby, for her errors: but tell me, is she in distress. If so, I know she is my fellow creature, and it is my duty to relieve her.” “Meriel,” (said he catching me in his arms) while tears of exultation burst from his eyes, “you surpass even the elevated idea I had formed of your prudence and virtue, Clara is in distress, I met her yesterday, with scarcely cloaths to shield her from the inclemency of the weather. She told me she had past the two last nights in the open air, exposed to nocturnal damps; that lovely form that once was shielded by a tender husband from even the most trifling inconvenience, had nought to rest upon but the cold earth, no canopy but heaven,—and two days had past since she had tasted food.”— “Merciful heaven, said I, (while my eyes overflowed,) why have I been kept thus long in ignorance, were is she, let us go, my dear Rooksby, shall I quietly enjoy the luxuries of life while poor Clara is in want of even the necessaries.” “I relieved her at the time, my love. Do not feel so acutely, I even promised again to see her; but my heart smote me, I thought should it reach your ears, you would think me the besest of mankind.” I should think you so, indeed, were you capable of beholding unmoved the miseries of a woman, with whom you once lived on terms of the greatest familiarity: but we are losing time. Let us hasten to the poor sufferer. Who knows, but we may lead her back to the paths of virtue? But hold! you shall go alone, Rooksby. She may consider my presence as an insult.” “She must, if she reflects at all, my dear Meriel, think it the highest condescention; and if you will be so generous as to visit and promise her your protection, I will write her a note to prepare her for the interview, and you shall see her in the afternoon.” “You will accompany me then?” “No, dear girl, I will not. After what has past, it is impossible to doubt either your delicacy or generosity. You shall act entirely as your own heart directs. I am sure by leaving you to its dictates, Clara will have no reason to complain: but let me intreat you not to mention this affair, either to my mother or Miss Sidney. I am sure they would blame the generous ardour with which you espouse the cause of the unfortunate Clara.” “I promised silence, and we returned to the house, Rooksby all life, spirit and tenderness; and I planing fifty different schemes for Clara's future support. At dinner Mrs. Rooksby was quite happy to see Clement's chearfulness returned; and Miss Sidney was too delicate and considerate to ask any questions concerning his late dejection and absence of mind. About five o'clock the chariot came to the door, and Rooksby handed me in, telling me the coachman knew where to drive, I cannot say but during my little ride, I underwent great agitation of spirits, I am certainly doing right, thought I, in offering my protection to the unfortunate Clara, and did not humanity point out my duty, self-interest would urge me to a performance of it, for should I not prove a friend to Clara, Rooksby undoubtedly would; and sensible, as I was, of the undue influence she once had over him, I could not but fear, that influence might again be exerted to his ruin: Besides, said I, who knows but Clara, had she been blest with friends to direct her, and counsel her aright might at this moment have been a shining member of society. Alas, it might have been my fate to wander forlorn and unprotected thro' the world, had it not been for the interposition of providence, who so wonderfully inclined the heart of the friendly Mr. Welldon to grant me succour and relief; and shall I who have experienced such blessings and support from an All Governing power, refuse my feeble assistance to raise from sorrow and infamy, a poor fallen sister. Oh no! That same benignant Power has pointed out my duty in the clearest manner, and I trust will not suffer me to be backward in the performance vol. iii. G of it.—Fully occupied by these and similar reflections, I hardly perceived what route the carriage had taken, till it stopped at the door of a small neat cottage. A wholesome looking young woman presented herself. I enquired for Mrs. Millar and was shewn into a parlour and informed she would wait on me immediately. I was scarcely seated when the door opened, and (judge if possible my surprize,) Mrs. Moreton entered.—An exclamation of wonder escaped me. Oh! Madam, said she, and unable to articulate more, sunk on the nearest chair, covered her face with her hands and burst into tears. “Be not alarmed,” said I, in the gentlest accent I could assume, “you have nothing to fear from me. But tell me do you live in this house, and are you any ways connected with the unfortunante Mrs. Millar.” “Oh! dear lady,” said she, (sinking on her knees and raising her streaming eyes to my face) “I am that unhappy wretch, I am that ungrateful monster who have injured (though Heaven knows involuntarily,) the very woman, who now generously comes to save me from despair.” I was greatly affected, my dear Celia, I raised the afflicted penitent, and bade her be comforted. “Comfort!” exclaimed she vehemently, “Alas! where can a wretch, whose crimes are so multiplied as mine, find it?” “It is never denied to the truly penitent: and I hope you will experience its benign influence.” “I shall! I begin to feel it already dawn on my benighted soul. It comes adminitered by an angel's hand.” I then made some enquiries concerning her present situation, and requested to be informed, in what manner I could render her service which would be most acceptable. “You cannot, my dear Madam,” said she, “judge how far I am worthy your compassion, unless you will permit me to acquaint you with the chief incidents of my past life. I know at this moment, I appear to you an unworthy unprincipled wretch. When I think of the situation, in which I left you at Kensington, I cannot but reflect how little I should expect from your hands. Nay that my very life is in your power, but when I shall inform how much I suffered for the unintentional injury I did you, I flatter myself you will pity and forgive me.” “But I must insist,” said I, “that you do not enter upon this detail till your situation is rendered more comfortable than it is at present.” “Permit me,” said she, interrupting me, “to remain at this cottage a few days. In that time, I will endeavour to commit to your perusal a written account of my miserable life, from the earliest period of recollection till now. I am sensible you will find much to blame—but, alas! you will find much more to awaken your compassion.— My crimes, though many, have not been my own: but my afflictions are. I have neither friend or relation to console, comfort, or alleviate my anguish.” The agony her countenance expressed, as she uttered this, is not to be described. I felt her solitary, forlorn situation, and while the tear of sympathy trembled in my eye, I breathed forth the accents of connsolation.— When she grew more composed, I arose to take my leave;—but was sadly at a loss how to offer the assistance I was sensible she wanted, without hurting her feelings. At length I ventured to draw forth my purse. She laid her hand on my arm—“That is entirely needless,” said she, “Mr. Rooksby has been very liberal. Let me not be thus oppressed with obligation, till some way is pointed out for me in some measure to show my gratitude.”—“Call it not an obligation,” said I, “It is only a debt due from the happy to the unfortunate.” “I have one request to make, dear madam,” said she, “suffer me then to decline this offered favour in hopes you will grant me the one nearer my heart.”—“Name it,” said I.—“It is,” she replied, “that you will forbear mentioning the circumstances that past at Kensington to Mr. Rooksby, till you have received my letter. After that you will think of me with more clemency than you do at present.” I bade her be quite easy in that respect, and leaving the purse on the table returned to the Hall, where I found Mrs. Rooksby and Amelia wonderfully curious to know where I had been. “To keep a particular appointment I assure you,” said Clement, “and as I am the only consident, that is trusted in the affair, I beg you will not be inquisitive concerning it; for I have promised secrecy.” He did not make any enquiry of what had passed at our interview, but pointedly avoided the subject. The next morning he presented me with two hundred pounds, saying, G 2 “My dear Meriel's expences may at this time be greater than usual. Make use of this my love, and should you require more, you know where to apply.” This sum I shall look upon as the property of Clara, and when we have settled some plan for her future support, it shall be appropriated entirely to her use. I was very impatient for the promised letter, as I imagined it almost impossible for her to extenuate a conduct so unjust and cruel as hers had been toward me; but resolved at all events to judge as candidly as possible, and extend toward her a friendship, which may awaken in her mind a just sense of her past errors, and lead her imperceptibly to the love and practice of virtue. At length the long expected packet arrived. I send a copy for my dear Celia's perusal. Oh! my friend, when you have perused it, you will like me, shed tears of sympathy over poor Clara's sufferings, till her offences are blotted from your remembrance.—Farewell, my Celia.

Though I have taken up my pen to address the most benevolent woman on earth, I shudder to think in what a despicable light I shall appear.—Oh! Madam, the heart not entirely rendered callous by guilt, shrinks from the scrutinizing eye of superior virtue, yet painful as the task is, I feel it is a duty I owe, to you, to myself, and to my dear forsaken children.—I am not, madam, as my sister-in-law represented to Mr. Rooksby, the daughter of a decayed officer; Alas! my friendship with this cruel sister, has been the chief cause of all my guilt and misery. My father was a gentleman of genteel fortune, and unsullied reputation. I was his only child, and at the age of thirteen having lost my mother was placed at a boarding school near Oxford, where I received a genteel education; and to my utter regret formed an acquaintance with Eleanor Ramsay, she was five years older than myself and was a teacher in this school, she had an expensive taste for dress, and was passionately fond of gaiety and pleasure. My father made me a liberal allowance for my pocket expenses. Eleanor was not so amply supplied, she told me that her father had been dead for some years and her mother's income was extremely confined tho' she strained it to the utmost in order that herself and brother might have the benefit of a liberal education.—Young Ramsay was a genteel engaging youth, and at that time employed in the study of the law. He frequently came to visit his sister, and sometimes took her to places of public entertainment, in which excursions I was imprudently allowed to accompany them. Ramsay pretended to be struck with my person; but I have since been convinced the fortune my father possessed and of which I was supposed heiress, was the chief incentive to the passion he so ardently prosessed. Eleanor was plain in her person, but artful and insinuating in her manner. She constantly contrived parties of pleasure, in which I was included: and in return I supplied her with money to purchase any article of finery which her own narrow allowance would not afford.— In this manner we proceeded till I reached my sixteenth year, when on receiving a summons from my father to prepare to quit school entirely, Ramsay and his sister shewed such marks of affliction at our approaching separation, the former declaring his existence depended on my constancy and affection; that giddy, thoughtless, and easily persuaded, I consented to an elopement and accompanied these false friends to Scotland, where I sealed myself the most wretched of womankind, by uniting myself to an unprincipled wretch, in whose whole family there was not one atom of honour or generosity.—On our return we hastened to my father and humbly requested his pardon and blessing.— Alas! I had forfeited all claim to both. He spurned me from him, and declared he would never see my face again. Overwhelmed with afflicton, I had now no course to take, but to repair with my husband to London to his mother and sister, who, I thought, received me very coldly, considering how eagerly they had strove to promote the union. Even Ramsay himself was much altered in his manner and I began to perceive, that they considered me as a burthen. I wrote a most penetential letter to my father, requesting to be received, and offering to quit a man, whom I found my heart was by no means attached to; but the answer I received was, that as I had voluntarily quitted his protection for that of a husband, and taken the liberty to choose for myself, without consulting him on the propriety of my choice, I must take the consequence of my precipitancy: but, he feared, if I paid as little regard to the duties of a wife, as I had done to those of a daughter, my husband would soon have reason to repent our union. He enclosed me a note for two hundred pounds, declaring it was all I must ever expect, as he had made his will in favour of a sister's son then abroad in the navy. This money proved a seasonable relief, as Mrs. Ramsay's affairs were greatly deranged; but it was soon expended, and I was again reduced to bear the ill-nature of all the family; for Ramsay never entertained a thought of giving me even an apartment to myself, nor indeed was it in his power, as he had no employment by which we could hope to be supported. We had been married about a twelve-month, when he received an offer of accompanying a young gentleman abroad. This he eagerly accepted, and I was left with Mrs. Ramsay. My situation was as uncomfortable as you can possibly imagine, I had not money even for necessary expences, and I could not help perceiving, that even my food was grudged by my mother-in-law. I thought once more of making a personal application to my father, but to my great affliction, he at that time died suddenly, and all his property devolved to the relation I have already mentioned. Though Mrs. Ramsay's finances were very confined, she lived in an expensive manner, kept a good deal of company and went frequently into public. One night being with her at the play, we were accosted by an elderly gentleman, who sat in the box with us, shewed us many civilities during the evening, and when the entertainment was ended, insisted on setting us down at our own door in his carriage, I thought there was an impropriety in accepting these civilities from a perfect stranger; but as my mother and sister acquiesced, I knew it would only be deemed prudery in me to resist.—I, therefore, followed their example, and steped into the carriage. When we arrived at home, the gentleman asked permission to enquire after our health the ensuing morning, which was granted. On our entering the house I began to rally Eleanor on the conquest she had made, as I naturally imagined these civilities were intended for her, but Mrs. Ramsay cried with more good humour than I had heard her speak for some time.s “No, no! my dear, Eleanor has no right to the glory of the conquest, I fancy it is you, my pretty Clara, who have attracted the old gentleman's notice; Eleanor's person is not adapted for making conquests.—“I hope you are mistaken, madam,” I replied; “for I should greatly rejoice in any good fortune which may happen to my sister. For my own part, my lot is cast.” The next morning, Mr. Millar (for it was he, who had accosted us the night before) called, and after chatting some time on indifferent subjects, offered to take us that evening to Ranelagh. From this time an intimacy commenced, and I soon really understood, that my unfortunate person had been the object of his pursuit. It was in vain I remonstrated on the impropriety of a married woman listening to overtures of love. Mrs. Ramsay treated the remonstrance as folly and romance. What shall I say, my dear madam, ill treated at home, distressed in my circumstances, no friend near to whom I could apply for advice or assistance. I insensibly gave way to the delusions of splendor and affluence, and one evening at a masquerade consented to my ruin.—A few days after this fatal night, I went with Mr. Millar to Oxford, which was the place of his residence. Eleanor accompanied me and I assumed the name of Millar. As I had not received a line from my husband since his departure from England, I imagined he had totally forgot me and would be as happy to be released from the burthen of maintaining me, as he once pretended he should be in obtaining my hand. Mr. Millar was extremely fond of me, I endeavoured as much as was in my power to return this affection with gratitude; but alas! madam, I was far from happy. Conscious guilt had fixed her fangs in my bosom and knowing myself unworthy the attentions I daily received from the virtuous part of my sex. I began to envy a superiority, the consciousness of which had given me so much pain; but though I was far from happy I had not yet tasted the misery of loving one object, while I felt myself bound to another. That superlative excess of anguish was reserved for me, 'till accident introduced Mr. Millar to Mr. Rooksby. I will not repeat the steps I took, (tears of contrition bathe my cheeks while I write it) to deceive the worthy Mr. Millar, and indulge my tenderness for Rooksby. Suffice it to say I gave a loose to love, and experienced its effects with more violence, as it was the first time my heart had ever been sensible of the passion; and certain it is, when we have taken one step in guilt we never pause at a second or a third, when either interest or pleasure urges our pursuit. You have no doubt been informed of my leaving Mr. Millar and following Mr. Rocksby to town; I VOL. III. H shall therefore pass over every circumstance that ensued until my acquaintance with you, (then Miss Howard) at Mrs. La Cours, and your subsequent removal to Kensington. At that time I had relinquished the name of Millar; but as I had an invincible aversion to that of Ramsay, and Mr. Rooksby refused me his, I assumed my own maiden name of Moreton. While I resided at Kensington, I received Mr. Rooksby's visits very privately, as he was anxious for me to preserve my character, and I wished to appear to you in the light of an amiable woman. I saw you regarded me with esteem, and I knew your heart too well to suppose that esteem would be continued, if you knew I was a slave to guilty passion.—Believe me, dearest, best of womankind, I never entertained an idea to your disadvantage. I wished from my soul to promote your welfare, and have taught my heart to rejoice in your prosperity, though that prosperity has torn from my agonized heart every earthly good: but to proceed—The day before I called on you and bespoke the linen for my sister Eleanor, I had received a note from Mrs. Ramsay informing me that a particular relation was come to town, and as they were unacquainted with my connection with Mr. Millar, &amp;c. and still regarded me as the wife of her son, she wished me to come to town and make them a visit, taking the eldest child with me. On the morning preceding the day on which this visit was to be paid, Eleanor let my watch fall, and without acquainting me with the circumstance sent it to have the damage repaired. You know what followed. I went to town; but, alas! on my arrival at my mother's, who should I meet but my unworthy husband. I now too late discovered that my sister had been in the plot to betray me. He instantly claimed me, as his lawful wife, and insisted on my accompanying him abroad, from whence, he said, he had only returned to fetch me; as he had through the interest of his friend, obtained a very respectable place under the French government. It was in vain to remonstrate. I was was obliged to comply, and early the next morning we set off for Dover, leaving the children with Mrs. Ramsay. On our arrival in that place, it was too late to think of crossing the channel that night. We therefore bespoke a passage on board a packet, and as it was to sail by five o'clock the next morning, we retired early to bed. But judge, dear madam, if possible, my anguish and surprize, when awaking about seven o'clock, I found my husband and sister had left me, and taken with them my trunks containing all my clothes, jewels, money, &amp;c. leaving me nothing but about six guineas which I had in my pocket. I arose with a heavy heart, and ordered some breakfast. While I was taking my solitary meal, I thought I heard a voice that was familiar to my ears, and inquiring of the maid who attended what company was then in the house, I learnt that Mr. Rooksby was there on his way to France, and that the packet he had taken for himself and servants did not sail till the next ride. I then remembered his informing me at his last visit, that he should be obliged to visit the continent before he could see me again, and overjoyed to find him in the same house with me, considered the treatment I had suffered from my husband as a fortunate circumctance, as it would probably procure me the pleasure of accompanying my adored Rooksby abroad. Pardon, madam, these involuntary expressions of affection, I will strive to restrain my pen: but when the heart has once been strongly attached, it is hard to break it of its usual effusions of tenderness. I bid the servent shew me to the room where he was, and rushing into it, overcome with the various emotions, which agitated my bosom, I fainted in his arms. It will be needless to repeat our conversation. I must only remark, that as I had never informed him of my unfortunate marriage with Ramsay, and, as he had always supposed me the wife of Mr. Millar, I did not dare explain to him the real cause of my abrupt appearance at Dover. He attributed it solely to my affection to himself, and I blest the chance which had led me to him. On our return from the continent, I made many enquiries concerning my dear Miss Howard, for whom I had suffered many an anxious hour; but could not by any means learn where you had taken refuge after the inhuman treatment you had experienced at Kensington. I make no doubt, madam, but you are acquainted with every circumstance, preceding the time in which I had hoped to be united to Mr. Rooksby. I had previously wrote to Mrs. Ramsay, requesting, she would use her interest with her son to relinquish all claim to me as his wife, and indeed, I had been informed I could refute that claim by pleading infancy at the time of my imprudent elopement. To these letters I received the most satisfactory answers, signed by both Ramsay and his mother, declaring they were heartily weary of the connection and would gladly renounce it, on condition of my paying a stipulated sum of money, to which I readily agreed, and began H 2 to look forward with hope to days of future happiness, and let me add innocence, for I felt my heart so firmly attached to the generous Rooksby, as to render it impossible for me ever to injure him even in thought. But, ah! my dear madam, how soon were these bright prospects overclouded, how quickly was this charming hope snatched from me, and, my bosom left a chearless and desolate chaos, which peace or joy can never more enliven. When I endeavour to retrace this most heart rending period of my life: such agonizing feelings overpower me, that my tears flow in scalding torrents down my cheeks; and sighs of acute anguish rend my bosom. I cannot at present proceed in my recital.—Oh! heavens, that one who knows so well the just value of virtue, should be irresistibly impelled to actions from which her soul shrinks with horror. The innocent may pity, but they cannot have the remotest idea of my sufferings. IN CONTINUATION. My heart is more at ease, tears are a sweet relief to the unfortunate, and when I remembered the words of consolation which I had listened to from the lips of angelic purity, when the benevolent Mrs. Rooksby cheared me with her presence, a soothing reflection, something like hope, pervaded my bosom, and though tears still continued to fall, they fell without pain. I will now proceed in my narrative. On the evening preceding the day on which I flattered myself with becoming the happiest of my sex, I expected Mrs. Ramsay to receive the money which I had promised to pay her, and therefore, desired the servants to deny me, even to the chosen master of my affections. Unfortunate hour, of what scenes of misery wert thou the harbinger, but I will not complain, I acknowledge I deserved it all, for had I not deceived the best the worhiest of mankind, by daring to accept his honourable offers, when I knew myself already sacrificed(I will not say united) to a villain. But what will not a woman do, who loves, who doats to madness and fears to be separated forever from the object of her adoration, what errors will not the heart involuntarily commit when under the influence of hood-winked passion?— It was about nine o'clock as I was sitting in the nursery, with my two dear boys, that a servant informed me the person whom I expected was below, I kissed my sweet cherubs bade them good night and repaired to the parlour, which I had appointed to receive Mrs. Ramsay in; but how great was my astonishment on entering the room to see my inexorable tormenter and his sister Eleanor, with their mother. I gave a shriek and sunk trembling on the nearest chair. Ramsay approached me with feigned tenderness— “why these alarms, my dear Clara,” said he “why should you start thus to behold the man who adores you, and who though you have cruelly deserted and injured, is ready again to receive you to his arms, and willing to forget all that is past.”—“would to heaven” said I, “that every past action of my life could be buried in eternal oblivion, particularly that to which I was artfully led by you and your insinuating sister, of giving you my hand, when a moment's reflection would have convinced me you had no share in my heart.”— “It is well, madam,” said he, “you have made a frank confession; but know it is amply in my power to revenge the repeated insults and injuries I have received from you.—You flatter yourself it is in your power to annual a marriage contracted in your minority, but it is not; and unless you consent to make me master of all the money and jewels at present in your possession, and leaving this house accompany me wherever I choose to go, I will to-morrow follow you to the Church and in the face of the whole congregation expose your infamous conduct, and claim my prior right not only to your person, but to all the wealth your infatuated lover has heaped upon you.”—What were my sufferings at this horrid moment. Turn either way, infamy stared me in the face. I was unable to determine what plan to pursue. To remain in London was impossible, after what had past as I should undoubtedly have been the jest even of my own servants. At length I concluded, whatever might be my fate, the generous Rooksby should not be involved in the shame that would consequently ensue on a public exposure of my guilt, I therefore told Ramsay I was ready to accompany him wherever he pleased; but as to the presents I had received from Mr. Rooksby, I did not conceive I had any right to take them with me.— This was not what the wretch wanted Horrible menaces and threats were used to prevail on me to give him my cash and jewels, I was intirely in the power of these three wretches, nor did I dare even to call for the assistance of my servants, as they all declared my life should pay the forfeit of such an attempt: and when they had gained their point, and I attempted to go up stairs to fetch the jewels, both Mrs. Rainsay and Eleanor accompanied me. On returning to the parlour, they desired me to send for a Hackney Coach.—Then it was, dear madam that my innocent infants darted across my memory. “I must have my children,” said I.—“Indeed, said the unfeeling Ramsay, but you will not. The brats are none of mine; leave them then to him who has a right to maintain them.” To describe my anguish at this cruel speech is impossible.—You, madam, are a mother, and it is only a mother can conceive my sufferings. I knelt, I bathed his feet with tears, and embraced his knees, but in vain. Too much under the dominion of fear to exert myself to insist on their being taken with me, I suffered myself to be led more dead than alive to the coach; and that very night we all set out for Cornwall. What arts they made use of to deceive my servant, I know not; but before our departure from London my trunks were brought to Mrs. Ramsay's, and one small one containing every necessary for travelling was opened that I might dress myself in a proper manner for so long a journey. I never could learn how they had contrived this, but am rather led to imagine they had bribed my own woman to their interest.—During my comfortless journey, all my thoughts were occupied by my beloved children, who were left entirely to the humanity of a man, whom I had deceived and injured in the grossest manner, and who might avenge the mother's crimes by deserting her offspring. I was sensible Rooksby possessed a benevolent heart, but when I remembered the provocations I had given him—I trembled for the fate of my poor infants, whose only birth-rights were poverty, shame, and the contempt of the world. It is impossibe for any one, who has not been in the same situation to judge of my distress. The anxiety of my mind affected my health, and before we arrived at our journey's end I was in a high fever. We stopped at a village near Saltash, where my disorder increased to such a degree that it was dangerous to think of removing me. A delirium ensued and I raved (as I have been since informed) incessantly for Rooksby and my children. At length, youth and a good constitution combated the strength of my disorder; and after a profound sleep of many hours, I awoke to perfect reason; but Gracious Heaven! what were my feelings, to learn when I enquired for Ramsay and Eleanor, that they were gone, and with them all my property. The clergyman of the parish a humane sensible man had frequently visited me, during my illness, and now entered the room with an intent to see if I yet lived. It was to him I had been indebted for all the attentions that had been shewn me: and when he found me capable of reading, he put into my hands a letter which he said my brother had left for me. At the word brother I expressed some astonishment: but my curiosity and impatience to read the letter would not then permit an explanation. This was the letter TO MRS. MORETON. In your attempts to dupe others you have been effectually duped yourself. Vain, foolish woman, who thought your boasted beauty would insure you admirers in all who beheld you. Ramsay is not your husband. He was mine long before he saw you. From the first moment he beheld you, I saw you had supplanted me in his affections, and therefore determined on revenge. I have (thank my kind genius) amply effected it, and reduced you to the lowest abyss of infamy and shame. My mother exults in your debasement, and bids you go vaunt your fancied superiority, and see if it will regain the reputation you have lost. You have no right to the name of Ramsay, nor indeed, to any but that of Moreton, which you have shamefully disgraced. Ramsay, was my maiden name, and as my marriage was a private one, my husband when visiting me always chose to assume that, and pass for my brother. I enclose you ten pounds, if you live it will be of some service to you, if not, whoever opens this may make use of it for past expences. I sincerely, and from my soul, wish your recovery, as my triumph will not be complete, unless I know you have felt the misery, in which I glory to have involved you. ELEANOR. Before I had finished this inhuman letter, I fell into strong convulsions, which occasioned a relapse of my disorder, and I was again reduced to insanity. The humane clergyman had me removed to his own house, and by the kind attentions of himself and a daughter, I was in time restored to health and a keen sense of my deplorable situation. As my strength returned, my afflictions recurred to my mind with greater force— My dear deserted infants perishing for want, VOL. III. I or exposed to the harsh usage experienced by children left to the parish, were constantly before my eyes, and I resolved at all events to return to London and learn their fate. Ill as my benevolent host could afford it, he lent me three guineas to help me on my journey, and gave me a letter to a poor woman, a late parishioner of his, who was married and settled in London, requesting her to render me every service in her power. With this slender sum, I sat forward and after a wearisome journey, sometimes riding, sometimes walking, I arrived safe in town, and took up my abode with the person just mentioned. From the enquiries I made (for I had the temerity to venture to Mr. Rooksby's house) I learnt his happy marriage with the amiable Miss Howard, and inwardly rejoiced to think that in such a union, his future happiness must be secure. I also learnt, that my children were in Devonshire. The maternal heart will yearn to pour forth its affection. I had determined to walk to the environs of Oak-hall and endeavour to gain a sight of my beloved little ones, when a most untoward accident prevented my putting my designs in execution. This was my kind landlady falling ill, and as she kept a shop, her husband earnestly entreated me to remain with them till her recovery; to which as I was under many obligations to them, I could not but assent. Her illness was painful and lingering, and in the end terminated her life. Soon after her decease, I proposed removing from the house, when the very man, who had so earnestly entreated my stay, now demanded payment for my board and lodging. I had neither money nor friends. What could I do? I thought once of applying to Mr. Rooksby; but the fear of giving you pain prevented me. I submitted to my hard fate in silence and was conveyed to prison. Three months did I linger in this wretched place, huddled among the most abject and miserable of the human race; and barely existing on the scanty pittance allowed me, and the charity of the benevolent. At length, I was one day recognized by a tradesman, with whom I had dealt in my days of affluence. He commiserated my condition, generously paid the sum for which I had been confined, and gave me two guineas in my pocket. No sooner was I at liberty, than I resumed my wish of going to my children. I set forward and almost begged my way to this place; but alas! when here, what could I do for support, what door would open to receive a poor wretch like me? I wandered every day round the environs of the hall, and once had the extatic pleasure of catching a glance of my children: but I dared not speak to them, though I longed to fold them to my maternal heart. My little stock of money was soon exhausted, though I lived almost upon bread and water, and at night, rested my weary limbs on the damp ground. But conscience told me it was all right, and only a just punishment for my errors; so I bore it without complaint, and watered my cold pillow with tears of unfeigned repentance. One afternoon, as I was wandering in the adjacent fields, overcome by hunger and distress, I sat down beside a brook that ran along the woodside and after reflecting a few moments on the horrors of my situation, I conceived the impious idea of putting a period to my existence. I arose from my seat to put my design in execution, when hearing a rustling on the other side the hedge, I started; and in a moment saw Mr. Rooksby come across a stile into the field where I was. I gave a faint scream and sunk to the ground oppressed by undescribable emotions. Urged by humanity, he approached and raised me from the earth. I opened my eyes; but dared not look at him. “Poor soul,” said he, in the accent of benevolence, “you seem ill. Where shall I lead you, or what can I do to serve you.” “Leave me,” I replied, with a look and voice of destraction—“Leave me Rooksby to the fate I merit.”—“Gracious heaven!” said he, “is it possible, or do my senses deceive me?”—“Oh!” said I, clasping my hands, “pity the wretched Clara, and leave her to die in peace.” “Clara,” cried he, slackening the arm that had supported me, “poor infatuated woman, how came you thus reduced?”— I need not repeat what answer I made— suffice it to say, I saw the tear of compassion sparkle in his eye, and heard him declare, I should be permitted to see my children.— He gave me relief with a liberal hand, and at parting, desired I would let him know where to find me, that I might not be again reduced to such misery. Thus, madam, have I retraced a life of complicated guilt and sorrow. I am fully sensible of the benevolence and candor of your heart, and I trust my unfeigned penitence joined to my sufferings will expunge from your memory my faults. Teach me, dear madam, how to convince you of my gratitude for your great condescension in interesting yourself in the fate of so worthless a being as I am, and whatever plan your I 2 goodness shall strike out, I will invaribly pursue, in hopes that my future life will convince you, with what abhorrence I reflect on my past misconduct. I have the honour to be, &amp;c. &amp;c. CLARA MORETON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XLVII. MERIEL to CELIA. Oak-hall, June 29th, 1783. I WAS obliged to send away my last in such a hurry, I had no time to make the least remark on Clara's letter. I will confess the story it contained did not strike me as altogether consistent or probable; but I made great allowances for that self love, which urges us ever to extenuate as much as possible our errors; and endeavour to set our conduct in the fairest point of view. I also remembered, that whatever had been her errors, she was now penitent and in distress; and must, unless some friend stepped forward to save her, sink into an untimely grave. I did not hesitate in resolving to become that friend, though I determined to keep the whole affair concealed from Mrs. Rooksby and Miss Sidney, and, indeed, I inwardly wished that Rooksby might not desire to see Clara's confession, as by reading it he must discover that I had known her before, which would immediately bring on an explanation of her cruel behavior to me, which he would not be very ready to overlook or pardon.— Fortunately he never even expressed the slightest desire to know what she had said. I told him, she should never want a friend, while I had power to assist her; and he seemed perfectly satisfied of the sincerity of my assertion. Accordingly I wrote to her, informing her if she would mention any place where she would like to reside, I would undertake to pay her board and besides allow something handsome for other necessary expences; but recommended to her to fix her residence in the country, where there would be fewer allurements to draw her from the laudable resolutions she had formed of amendment. I received for answer, that the fondness of a mother impelled her to wish her residence might be in the neighborhood of Oak-hall, and that she was perfectly satisfied with the family, with whom she then was; but if I disapproved of her remaining there, she was ready to remove to any other place I might think more suitable. I am a mother myself, my dear Celia, and I found it was impossible to deny her request. She is now settled at the farm, and I have ordered the two boys to be taken twice a week to see her, though under this restriction, that she does not betray herself to them, as that would involve us all in confusion at the hall, as I am certain my mother and Miss Sidney would be greatly displeased with my taking any interest in her affairs, or suffering her to be so near our habitation; she continues the name of Moreton, and as she lives retired, and I would hope a truly penitent and virtuous life. She does not excite any enquiries that might lead to a discovery. IN CONTINUATION. August 3d. Last night Mr. Belger arrived. I cannot account for it, Celia, but the presence of this man always distresses and alarms me. I am never comfortable when he is in the family, though it is only for a visit of a few hours. How I shall support his company for six weeks or two months, I cannot tell. It is a long time since I have mentioned my sweet Clementina; believe me, were I to give inclination the reins; I should fill a whole sheet with accounts of the dear little cherub's daily improvement. But, though the theme would be delightful for a fond mother to expatiate upon, I am sensible it would be but insipid, when offered to the perusal of one who though interested in all my concerns, never felt a mother's tenderness, anxiety and solicitude. 10th. You will be surprized, my dear Celia, when I tell you, I am become the lady Bountiful of all our poor tenants and their families. I walk round every morning or evening; that the weather permits, and administer to the deseases of both body and mind. In the first I am assisted by a worthy apothecary, who having a large share of merit, Fortune thought he had sufficient, and was therefore extremely sparing of her favours; so that the poor man with a great deal of knowledge in his head, much benevolence in his heart, and a large family in his house, had but very little money in his purse. I heard of him by accident, and not being extremely well, sent for him, though his unpowdered wig and thread-bare coat would not have been a recommendation, had I consulted his appearance only; but I chatted with him half an hour several mornings successively, and found his company more efficacious than his medicines; for I was always better after his visits, the reason of which was, I thought the doctor himself seemed happier. So one afternoon, Amelia and I took a stroll across the park, and spent an hour or two with his wife and her six chubby, rosy cheeked children, and at parting, contrived it so that at the next visit the doctor came neither in an unpowdered wig or thread-bare coat; since which time he has constantly been our escorte in our visits to the sick. I find money and he finds physic, and I do assure you we are both very well pleased with our several departments. Besides you cannot think how the doctor is rising in reputation, since his appearance is so mended. He is now often seen coming out of the doors of the wealthy, which I hope presages he will one day become wealthy himself. 13th. I am extremely flurried and vexed, indeed I think my evil genius prevailed, when Rooksby first formed an acquaintance with Belger. The man is an unprincipled libertine, and Amelia was greatly mistaken, when she imagined any tie however sacred, would be restriction upon his licentious passion.— Rooksby had rode out last evening, Amelia was reading to Mrs. Rooksby, and I imagining Belger was with my husband, took a book in my hand and strolled out to indulge a contemplative mood, which at that time prevailed over my mind. I rambled farther than I at first intended, and before I was aware of it, the shades of night came on.—The evening was remarkably fine, the moon arose veiled in a fleecy cloud, which served only to increase the glory it could not hide; a gentle zephyr whispered through the trees, and I felt a sensation of gratitude, wonder and delight pervade my soul; whilst admiring, I beheld the beauty of the surrounding scene, at the top of a walk at no great distance from the house, but on a little eminence, there is a summerhouse greatly admired by all the family for the charming view it commands of an extensive well cultivated country. In this place I had been working in the morning, and in passing it, recollected I had left my work-bag there, in which was something I wanted. I therefore stepped in with a design of bringing it away. The moon shone through the windows full upon an organ which was placed there for me to entertain myself with, and as I am fond of solemn music, the stillness of the evening and the serenity of every surrounding object inspired me with a wish to touch the instrument. I therefore sat down, and following the impulse of my soul, began the following Hymn to Gratitude: Where'er I turn my ravish'd eyes, New scenes of beauty round me rise, My heart exulting glows; And While I view the wond'rous whole, To the Creative Power my soul, With gratitude o'erflows. You burning orbs, that round the pole, In solemn grand succession roll, Declare their Maker's power; Then while such glories deck the sky, Can such a weak frail worm as I But worship and adore. Father of all thou dost bestow On us poor reptiles here below, Each good we're taught to prize; And tho' sometimes we feel thy frown, The truly grateful heart must own Thy judgments just and wise. Hail, Gratitude, celestial guest, Come make thy mansion in my breast, Thou spark of love divine; Inspir'd by Thee, tho' troubles rise, My soul shall mount toward the skies, And heaven itself be mine. I had sung it over once, and was just repeating the last stanza with all the real fervour which at that moment warmed my soul, when hearing a footstep, I turned round and saw Mr. Belger enter the summer house. “So you are returned,” said I, rising from my seat; “but pray where is Rooksby.” “I have not been with him,” replied Belger, “nor do I think he is returned. I have been enjoying a far greater pleasure, than any he can meet with abroad. I have been listening to your charming voice, which with such enthusiastic fervour, has been pouring forth the grateful emotions of your soul.” “I have been here some time,” said I carelessly, “and I believe it is getting late. vol. iii. K Pray do not let me interrupt your intended ramble; but I am afraid of taking cold should I remain here any longer.” “You must not go, dearest, loveliest of women, I cannot lose this only opportunity which I have had of speaking to you without observation. Hear me, pity me! From the first moment, that I beheld you, my heart has known neither joy nor peace. In every place, in every hour, sleeping or waking, your image still pursues me. I love, I doat to madness and yet have only the hope of exciting your compassion.” “My contempt sir, you certainly excite, by this unparalled effrontery. I thought Mr. Belger had received my answer on this subject some years since, and am surprized however, he then dared to insult an unprotected girl, that he should suppose he might with impunity now repeat those insults to the wife of his friend.” He listened not to what I was saying, but placing himself between me and the door, forcibly seized my hands, and was proceeding to the most romantic professions of platonic love, when I saw Mr. Rooksby coming up the walk. Agitated and distressed beyond measure, I cried “cruel, persecuting Belger, you have exeposed me to the suspicions of my husband, who must suppose a guilty assignation has been the cause of our being alone here at this late hour.” I had not time to say more. Mr. Rooksby entered. “why, my dear Meriel” said he, “do you stay out thus late exposing yoursef to the dews of the evening,” then perceiving Belger, he added, “but you have company with you, and, perhaps, I intrude on an agreeable tete-a-tete.” I endeavoured to compose my agitated spirits, and answer him in a style of raillery; but it was impossible. I discovered by the manner in which he spoke, that the unhappy jealousy of his temper was awakened, and that it would not be an easy matter to convince him, his suspicions were without foundation, I trembled, as I took hold of his arm; and we proceeded in silence to the house. When we entered, my mother tenderly expressed her anxiety and fears of my having taken cold, Amelia too gently chid me for playing truant as she called it. I do not know how I looked, but I am sure I felt very disagreeably. Indeed, the raillery of Amelia, the cold reserve of Rooksby, and the humiliating glances of Belger so powerfully affected my feelings; that I pleaded indisposition and retired to my apartment, where I have given vent to my tears, and in some measure eased my heart, by relating the cause of my uneasiness to my friendly Celia. I fear, it will be long before Rooksby will again look on me with tenderness; and when I recollect, the manner of my leaving Mrs. Rooksby and Amelia, the length of time I was absent, and my being found at so late an hour in the summer house with Belger, who no doubt had also been rambling about for some time, though we had but that moment met. All these circumstances must tend to make me appear guilty of impropriety, if not imprudence. Again and again I repeat it. Belger seems doomed to be the bane of my happiness. Amelia has just been with me. I informed her of the cause I had for uneasiness. She blamed me for retiring so early, saying it gave me an appearance of conscious guilt, though she was fully sensible that every thought of my heart was purity itself; she bade me assume an air of cheerfulness, as she was afraid that the timid embarrassment that modesty and real innocence ever discovers, when glanced on by the eye of suspicion, would only tend to encrease the doubts Rooksby already harboured. But I hear him coming. I must quit my pen and retire to bed, though greatly I fear, not to rest. 14th. When Rooksby entered the apartment, a mixture of sorrow, anger and distress sat on his countenance.—“I thought, madam,” said he, “you were indisposed, as you retired so early; but I see you are not in bed yet; but agreeable meditation is certainly more pleasing, than the company of those we dislike. Pray do not let me disturb your reverie.”—“You speak in riddles, Mr. Rooksby. Whose company did you suppose I fled from, when I left the parlour. Solitude, indeed, was more agreeable than to be in company, and witness the frown of displeasure that sat on your countenance. It was not the headach impelled me to retire; it was a pain more acute.”—I could not proceed, but laying my hand on my bosom, the involuntary tear choaked my utterance. “My beloved Meriel, “said he, sitting down by me, and speaking in a softened accent, “do not weep. Those precious tears would melt a heart of adamant: think then, how much they must distress one who glows with unutterable tenderness toward you.” “Ah Rooksby, why, if you really experience such tender emotions in my favour, why have you wounded my heart, by uttering such unkind, I may say, cruel suspicions.” “Meriel”, said he, looking at me intently, “did you not confess you knew Belger some time since at Kensington.” “Most assuredly, I did.” “And during the time of your acquaintance there, did he never express his admiration—his esteem—his love to you.” “How can you ask such a question? He was at that time”— “Married, you would say,” cried he, interrupting me, “but I know he was not, and I remember hearing him once speak of a beautiful creature, he knew at that place, who had more power over his heart than all the rest of the sex put together.” “And therefore, it follows,” said I, “that I must be the person he meant (attempting a smile.) My dear Rooksby, if you have such an opinion of your Meriel's attractions, she has a far more humble one of herself.” “But you had certainly been indulging him, this evening, with a long tete-a-tete.” “You are mistaken, He had not been in the summer house above three minutes before you joined us.” “There is such an ingenuous frankness in your manner, dear girl, that it would be almost a crime to doubt of your sincerity. Yet when I reflect”— In saying this, he started up and striking his forehead with his hand, he cried, “these doubts will unsettle my reason”—I was terrified, and rising from my seat endeavoured to sooth him. He took my hand and pressing it to his lips, said, “I cannot credit aught to your disadvantage. Your countenance is so expressive of innocence, that it is impossible to believe you otherwise. Forgive my ungenerous conduct. It is the fault of my nature. Forget it, and I will be careful how I offend again.” You may be sure, I was not backward in promising a total forgetfulness of this painful event: but I am sensible, my dear Celia, it is impossible to keep my promise, for though we all met this morning in the same social manner as usual, I felt such a restraint upon myself whenever Belger addressed me, and answered the most trifling questions with such evident imbarassment, that to even an indifferent spectator I must have appeared strangely agitated. Indeed, my friend, I began to wish I had not concealed from Mr. Rooksby any thing, that passed during my residence at Kensington. If I had informed him of Belger's unprincipled behaviour to me at that place he might not have renewed his intimacy, but I always have an objection to relating any tale whereof I am myself the heroine, and in this point I avoided it, fearing to incur the imputation of vanity, and in so doing, I have incurred that of guilt.—To mention these circumstances now would be impossible, as it would only tend to confirm Rooksby's suspicions, perhaps engage him in a quarrel with Belger and by making it a public affair, cast a blemish on my reputation, which no future conduct will ever wipe off. But I think through the whole course of my life I have been particularly unfortunate in having my most innocent actions misconstrued, and though my own bosom conceals not a wish which does not tend to the universal happiness of mankind in general. I have never wanted enemies, who are ever ready to catch at the errors, to which frail mortality is liable; and magnify them into crimes.—I have however a sweet consolation Celia. My heart is conscious of its own integrity and relies on that Power, who knows its innocence to support it through every trial, which in His wisdom He may see proper to lay upon it. This is a consolation of which no afflicton, however severe, can rob me. Mrs. Rooksby is I fear, in a declining state of health. Age and its attendant infirmities bend her frame to the earth; but her mind is still in full vigour. She is the same pious, resigned chearful christian, as ever: and her company is equally sought by the young as well as by those more nearly of her own years. A journey to the south of France is judged necessary for her the ensuing winter. Mr. Rooksby does not wish to leave England; so I have not hinted my desire of accompanying her. Indeed, my present situation would render travelling dangerous, Amelia goes with her, and I mean to invite Susan Mossop to spend the winter with me in town, not that I expect to reap much pleasure from her society; but I think a residence in my family may be of service to her; and should any proper match offer, the want of a fortune shall not be an obstacle, Adieu my friend, your's ever. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XLVIII. MERIEL to CELIA. Oak-hall, October 9th, 1783. Surely, surely, my friend, I was born to be the sport of fortune; for truly can I say with the Poet, That e'er the cup of joy could reach my lips, 'Twas dash'd with gall.— I had but just began to taste the supreme felicity of domestic happiness, had began to look forward to rising years of peace and comfort, when this Belger, like a demon of cruelty appears, and all my pleasing prospects vanish— Like some poor traveller, whom Merlin leads Thro' fragrant bowers and delicious meads; And while his feet the magic paths pursue, And while he thinks the fair illusion true— The baseless vision melts in fluid air, And woods and wilds and thorny ways appear. Yes, my beloved friend, the sweet enchanting scenes of happiness now sade upon my fight, and like the delusive vision of a disordered imagination, serves only to make the surrounding desolate prospect, the more dark and gloomy. From the time of my last letter, Mrs. Rooksby's health has evidently become worse and worse every day; so that we were obliged to hasten her departure for the continent, as the physicians feared the cold autumnal blasts would be too much for her enervated frame to bear. We were busy in preparing for her departure, when one evening just as the sun was set, a little girl came and informed me a poor tenant of our's was taken suddenly ill, and wished very much to see me.—As Amelia was busy in her own apartment, I would not interrupt her to request her company; but taking some cordials with me and bidding Thomas follow, I took hold of the little girl and bid her lead me to the cottage. When I arrived the poor woman told me she had been seized with a sudden fit, and imagining herself dying—she had sent for me to recommend her children to my care; but as she now found herself much better, she humbly hoped I would pardon the trouble she had given me. As I had walked very quick, I found myself somewhat fatigued and sat down for a few moments to rest. Whilst I sat, I busied myself in making enquiries concerning the poor woman's family, and learnt that she had seven children and a very bad husband.—“I have been in a deal of trouble, madam,” said she, “Robin has been very idle this summer and had gotten himself in debt; but we were relieved from our necessities by a gentleman, who is I believe, at the Hall; for the children say they have seen him there. Oh! madam, he has been the preserver of me and mine, and I am bound to pray for his prosperity.” She was eagerly proceeding, when casting my eye toward the window, I saw Belger open the wicket, which served for a gate, and come in.—“Here is your benefactor coming good woman” said I, and slipping two guineas into her hand, went toward the door, but was not quick enough to escape, before Belger entered.—“Bless me my fair hostess,” said he, in an accent of surprise; “who could have thought of seeing you here; not that it is surprising to see Mrs. Rooksby in the cottage of poverty sweetly alleviating its attendant evils, but the lateness of the hour and to see her without Miss Sidney.” “Amelia was engaged,” said I endeavouring to pass him, “and indeed, I did not observe how late it was.”— “You will permit me to see you home?” “By no means Mr. Belger. I have my servant with me.” “Do not, dearest madam, deny me the selicity of walking by your side and enjoying a few moments uninterrupted conversation, a blessing I cannot obtain at the hall.” “Nor can I think, sir, you have any thing to say to me, to which the whole world might not be a witness, I desire you will suffer me to go home alone. I have particular reasons.” “I know your reasons, most lovely, most injured of women. Rooksby is jealous, weary of the possession of the most inestimable treasure, he seeks by accusing your spotless purity to excuse his own errors.”— “Stop, Belger, I will listen no longer, Rooksby is too just to suspect the integrity of a heart, with whose very emotion he is acquainted. As to errors I neither suspect him capable of any; derogatory to his own honour or prejudicial to our mutual happiness; and know, sir, the person who would endeavour to awaken suspicion in my bosom, will be ever held as an object of contempt and detestation.” VOL. III. L I then darted at him a look expressive of my honest indignation, and endeavoured to quit the house: but he threw himself on his knees before me, and forcibly taking my hand earnestly requested to be heard for only one moment. From the instant Belger first entered, the woman had from a motive of respect left the room, and my servant was without side the gate, waiting for my coming out. I was hesitating for an answer, by which I might hope to make him relinquish his design; when I heard my husband's voice enquiring of the servant, “whom he was waiting for?” “My miseress, sir,” replied the man. “Your mistress is here then—and who is with her?” “Mr. Belger went in a few moments since.” “Damnation!” exclaimed he, and pushing by the man with violence instantly rushed into the house. How I looked, or what I said, I cannot pretend to determine, but of this I am certain my feelings were undescribable. “It is well, madam,” said he, “I have at length discovered the true cause of your frequent rambles toward this cottage, and by heavens.”—Rage choaked him, I summoned all my resolution and endeavoured to calm his agitated spirits. “Frequent rambles, Mr. Rooksby, I do not understand you; I never was at this cottage before, nor should have come now had I not been sent for.” “I know you were sent for. That is the very thing that drives me to madness. Oh! Meriel, to think on the very last evening before my mother and Miss Sidney leaves England, you could quit them and taking advantage of my absence fly on the wings of love to meet your abandoned seducer. But, this is no time for argument; tell me, thou vile reptile, who under the mask of friendship hast dishonoured me, what reparation can you make for the peace you have destroyed, for the purity you have fullied?— “Dear Rooksby,” (said Belger in a tone of dissembling gentleness,) “you are carried away by a wild ungovernable passion, I give you my honour I had not been in the house ten minutes when you entered; nor had I the most distant idea of meeting Mrs. Rooksby here, you iujure her by these unjust suspicions, and what ought to be at this time a material consideration, you agitate her spirits, impair her health and endanger her valuable life.”— “Belger” said my husband, with a voice that made me tremble, “you are both a coward and a villain.” “You cannot mean what you say.” “I do,” reiterated Rooksby, fiercely. “Then, sir, to-morrow between five and six o'clock, I shall expect to see you in a proper place to settle this difference. But remember Rooksby, I warn you of the remorse that will seize you, when you discover how injuriously you have treated both your wife and friend. “Belger,” said I exerting all the firmness I was mistress of, and laying my hand on his arm, as I spoke.—“If you are not callous to the voice of humanity, explain this horrid mystery, for I am certain the accidents of this night have been concerted to ruin me in the opinion of my husband. You call yourself his friend. How well you deserve that title your own conscience can best inform you, that and the all-seeing eye of a just providence knows my innocence, and I trust, it will hereafter, be made appear clear as the noon day sun. In the mean time, dare not as you value your eternal welfare, to lift your impious hand against the life of Rooksby; or, by throwing yourself in the way of danger, run the hazard of rushing unprepared into the presence of your offended Maker, for let honour give it what false gloss it will, the man, who wantonly throws away his life is as much guilty of suicide, as the wretch who ends his existence with a loaded pistol. And in the case of duelling vanquish or be vanquished, you are equally a murderer. Go, leave us, would to heaven, I could say to that peace which was uninterrupted, till your arrival here.—Return to London, or go any where; so as I may not have the weight of bloodshed to drag my almost broken spirit to the earth. Rooksby started up with fury and snatching my hand from off Belger's arm, cried— “by heavens you tremble only for him. So as he is safe you care not what becomes of me. But come, madam, let us return, it is almost dark.” As he said this, he pulled me redely from my seat. I attempted to walk; but terror had unnerved my limbs. I sunk down again on the chair, and had L2 not a flood of tears relieved me, I must have fainted. He was alarmed and called the woman to bring some water, and saying he would send the carriage to fetch me as I was unable to walk,—he went out, followed by Belger in sullen silence. When he was gone, my agitation became so great, it threw me almost into hysterics. I was not sufficiently mistress of my recollection to ask the woman any questions, but gave vent to my overcharged heart in a torrent of unrestrained affliction, and when the carriage arrived, threw myself into it almast distracted with the violence of my emotions, where, to my great comfort, I found my kind soothing friend Amelia. I related to her what had just happened; she comforted me all that lay in her power, and told me Belger had retired to his apartment immediately on entering the house, and that Rooksby went to the library, where he was busy writing. She said she would endeavour to see the former before she went to rest, and persuade him to set off for London, entreated me to hide my uneasiness from Mrs. Rooksby, as her weak state of health would but ill support the shock of such intelligence, when she supposed us the happiest of the hymenial votaries, and lamented her being obliged to leave me in so disagreeable a situation. I thanked the dear friendly girl; but entreated her not to be uneasy; said she could not perform to me a more acceptable service than by attending to the welfare of my mother, promised to be guided by her advice and bear my afflictions with patience. And so I will, my dear Celia; for have I not conscious innocence for my support, and is it not my duty to submit without repining, to the will of Him, who never lays on his creatures the rod of affliction but for some wife purpose. He can humble the frail body to the dust the more to exalt the soul. He can cause the bones that he has broken to rejoice, and heal the broken heart. I feel his mercies at this moment abound in the comforts of an approving conscience. I acknowledge his judgments just, and pray only for meekness and resignation to bear his dispensations as I ought. Celia, I must break off, I am ill; when able I will again continue my narrative, beaven bless you. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XLIX. MERIEL to CELIA. London, Nov. 29th, 1783. I have been extremely ill since I last addressed my dear Celia, occasioned by the violent agitation my spirits had undergone. The morning after the disagreeable rencounter mentioned in my last, I found myself much indisposed; but as it was the day intended for Mrs. Rooksby's departure, I arose at the usual time and endeavoured to appear as chearful as possible, that the dear old lady might not perceive the distress of my mind. Rooksby seemed inspired with the same wish and though he had not spoken to me during the whole night, yet at breakfast assumed his usual tenderness of manner. It was with infinite pleasure I learnt that Belger had set out for town long before any of the family were stirring, leaving only a card to my mother pleading urgent business as his excuse for so precipitate a departure, and wishing her intended journey might have the desired effect and restore her to perfect health. At twelve o'clock the chariot drew up to the door—I felt my spirits sink. I looked first at my dear Amelia, then at my mother, and taking a hand from each, pressed them to my heart and burst into tears. It was in vain any longer to hide my sorrows—I saw these invaluable friends departing from me at the very moment when I most wanted their soothing attentions. I looked on my generous benefactress, perhaps, for the last time. Her wan cheek and emaciated frame, too plainly announced her approaching dissolution. I threw my arms round her—I endeavoured to articulate an adieu—but words were denied me.—“God bless you, my dear child,” said she. “Clement, be tender of her—comfort her—study her felicity—and may Heaven shower its choicest blessings on you both.” She then took up my little Clementina, and letting fall a tear as she pressed the smiling Cherub to her bosom, cried emphatically, “Oh thou sweet angel! Heaven grant that you may live to be an honour to your father and a blessing to your mother—mayest thou be endowed with all her virtues without any of his faults.” She then once more embraced me and went to the carriage. Amelia stayed behind a moment to comfort and re-assure me. She bid me keep up my spirits and trust in that Power for support, who never yet forsook the innocent. Rooksby accompanied them some miles on horse back. I followed the chariot with my eyes as long as I could, and then retiring to my chamber, threw myself on the bed, and gave a loose to unutterable sorrow. However the spirit may be afflicted, nature exhausted by various conflicts will insensibly sink under the balmy influence of sleep.— This was my case: I slept about two hours, but awoke unrefreshed, and in acute pain. My head ached, my tongue was parched, and I had every symptom of an approaching fever. However I endeavoured to rise and dress, to be ready to receive Rooksby, as he proposed returning to dinner: but to this task I was unequal. My head was giddy and my limbs trembled. Hester, my woman, was alarmed. She rang for the house-maid, who just came in time to help to support me; for in attempting to go from my bedchamber to the dressing-room, I had fainted. On recovering, I found much worse consequences were to be apprechended, than I had at first imagined. I sent immediately for medical assistance and about four o'clock the next morning, I was delivered of a dead child. For some hours I was totally insenble, and for more than a week my life was despaired of. Rooksby was frequent in his enquiries after my health; but I could plainly perceive, he thought more of the loss of his son than my evidently dangerous situation. However it pleased Heaven to restore me, though by slow degrees, and the moment the physicians pronounced me able to bear the fatigue of travelling, I set off for London, vainly hoping that variety of scenes, company and public amusements would restore in some measure my lost chearfulness; at least I thought it would banish those corroding reflections which gnawed and goaded my poor lacerated heart. Oh! my beloved Celia, Rooksby no longer retains the smallest degree of affection for me. In company he is polite, but distant; when by ourselves (which is indeed but seldom) he is cold, unkind, and my Celia will hardly believe it, he once on my gently remonstrating on this painful change, struck me, nay cursed me, and called me by a name, my soul shudders to think on. That he hates and despises the woman he once doated on is now become too evident to be doubted; for he has never returned to my apartment since my illness, but occupies one in another part of the house. Susan Mossop is with me. She is possessed of more tenderness and goodness of heart than I at first suspected. She labours incesantly to amuse me, and though I cannot partake of her chearfulness, I am grateful for her attention. Hester is married to a man of genteel fortune, but from what I can judge of the character of both, I think they will pass that kind of insipid life so well described by Prior in his epitaph on sauntering Jack and idle Joan. Nor wished, nor cared, nor laughed nor cried, And so they lived, and so they died. I am just returned from an airing in Hyde Park, and have been greatly astonished to see Clara there, whom I left in Devonshire. She was on horse-back, elegantly mounted and attended by a servant in livery. A confused idea ran through my mind, when I first saw her, yet surely she can never add ingratitude to infamy, by seducing the affections of the husband, when she has been rescued from want and misery by the wife, yet, what can have brought her to town, or how is it possible she can afford to appear in the manner just described.— I am satisfied Rooksby must still hold some intercourse with Clara. We have just had a tete-a-tete in which he accused me of deceiving him, of giving him my hand when my heart was devoted to another; and of having been long acquainted with Belger, with whom it was well known, I had an illicit intercourse. Dearest Celia, imagine the agonizing feelings of my heart on being subject to such unjust, such cruel suspicions. It was in vain I attempted to assert my innocence; he was well informed, he said, of every incident that had passed during my residence at Kensington; that I had been the intimate acquaintance of women of light characters; that my own conduct in regard to Belger was notoriously infamous, and that I was in reality the exact reverse of what I had speciously appeared to his mother, or she never would so strenuously have pressed our union. Oh! my friend, would to heaven, I had trusted to the dictates of my own judgment, had been guided by the impulse of my heart which strongly urged me to reject this man; but compassion, gratitude, and the combined wishes of those whom I most loved and respected, operated so powerfully on my feelings, that I was unable to withstand their solicitations; and Heaven be my witness, I have not in one instance since I have been united to Rooksby infringed the smallest duty incumbent on the sacred character of wife. A letter—it is from Amelia, Heaven grant no ill news.—Read it Celia, I inclose it for your perusal, and wonder not that vol. iii. M my fast salling tears oblige me to bid you adieu!— MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER L. AMELIA to MERIEL. Aix-la-Chapelle, Nov. 9th, 1783. It is with infinite regret, I take up my pen to inform my dear friend, that the flattering appearance of Mrs. Rooksby's returning health, which had so elated my spirits are entirely vanished, and an encreasing debility of frame, baffles all the skill of the physicians and alarms us to an imminent degree. My mind is in such a state of painful anxiety, that I hardly know what I write. When I am present with the dear invalid, I endeavour to command my feelings and appear chearful, but the effort is vain, and when I contemplate her pale, yet placid countenance, the tears will involuntarily burst from my eyes. She, this morning, observing my emotions, called me to the bedside, (from which she is now scarcely able to rise, even while it is making) and taking my hand, “my dear Miss Sidney,” said she, “do not let my approaching dissolution give you pain.—I see it draw near with no other apprehension than what frail mortality must feel, when called from a temporal to an eternal state, into the immediate presence of the Creator of the Universe!—I have had my span lengthened out far beyond what I had ever expected.—I feel no regret at leaving this transitory life;—for my only care was centered in the happiness of my son, and him I shall leave happy in the affection of the best, the worthiest of her sex. I know my beloved Meriel will feel my loss: But time will mitigate her affliction and she will bear it with the fortitude of a christian. I have one thing to mention, which nearly concerns your happiness. I have a nephew here whom you have seen—Captain Onslow is a man every way worthy the esteem of a woman of sense. He is not insensible to the merit of Miss Sidney, and has requested me to plead his cause. I flatter myself you will not refuse his suit.”—She paused. I was silent. I had frequently seen and admired Captain Onslow: he is in the East-India service; for though a man of fortune, he prefers a life of activity to one of supine indolence. An indifferent state of health, brought him to Aix-la-Chapelle; but being now perfectly recovered, he proposed rejoining his regiment, which it is expected will be ordered to Bengal the ensuing season. I should not be thus particular, but knowing from some disagreement between Mr. Rooksby and the Captain, you were totally ignorant that you had such a relation, and therefore might wish some information. I had without vanity reason to suspect the Captainss partiality; nor can I with truth assert, that my bosom felt that indifference toward him, which it had ever maintained toward the rest of his sex. Yet Mrs. Rooksby taking me at a moment so unprepared, I hesitated, and knew not what to answer. She saw my confusion and then continued, “I have in my will left you a small token of my regard, which if you listen to Onslow's suit, I shall insist on seeing settled on yourself, if it is not painful, my dear Amelia, I could wish to hear your candid sentiments on this subject, and it would give me infinite satisfaction to see you united to so worthy a man before I breathe my last; as the welfare of every one dear to my charming daughter-in-law must ever interest my fondest solicitude.” I thanked the generous woman in terms of heartfelt gratitude, assured her I was perfectly happy in my present situation, but that if it was my fate to change, I knew of no person I should prefer to Captain Onslow. My only objection would be the difference subsisting between him and Mr. Rooksby, as I feared it would prevent that social intercourse that I must ever wish to continue uninterrupted between Mrs. Rooksby and myself. “I will obviate that objection my dear,” said she, “for it shall be my last request to Clement that all animosity be laid aside, as he values my blessing. And now,” continued she, with a faint smile, “there remains nothing to be done but for you to take your pen and bid my son and his amiable wife to your nuptials. The jaunt will be of service to Meriel after her late illness, and she will have the double pleasure of seeing her beloved friend enter into an honourable and happy marriage, and me into a state of everlasting bliss; and tell her from me she should celebrate the two events as equally joyful.” “Oh! my dear madam, said I,” in an agony of grief, “do not talk thus, I hope you will recover.”— “Impossible,” said she, waving her hand with a solemn yet benignant look, “I have M 2 enquired of the physicians how long they suppose I can remain. They informed me, yesterday, I may possibly continue three weeks or a month longer; but that is the utmost; therefore my dear Amelia, lose no time. I could wish to see my dear children once more, and I am certain the bare mention of that wish will be sufficient to bring them eagerly to me.” Thus, my dear Meriel, have I executed the desire of my almost expiring benefactress; hasten to me my friend that we may pour our affliction into each others bosom, and by participation lighten the burthen that will press so heavy on our hearts. I flatter myself the death-bed of an amiable and respected parent will have a good effect on the mind of your unkind truant, and bring him back to a sense of the happiness he is wantonly trifling away. I trust you will use all possible expedition. I have agreable to Mrs. Rooksby's desire wrote to her son requesting his immediate acquiescence with her wish. Oh! my dear Meriel, my mind is sorely oppressed, I shrink from the thought of uniting myself to Captain Onslow at the very moment, when tears of real sorrow will dim the lustre of the hymenial torch: but your better judgment shall in this and every particular direct that of your AMELIA SIDNEY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LI. MERIEL to CELIA. Paris, January 29th, 1784. From this great theatre of dissipation and folly does Meriel once more address her friend —but why am I not permitted to see you? why in the same kingdom does indispensible duties keep me from flying to you, and in your peaceful cloister burying myself at once from the world and all its sorrows? Alas I too plainly feel that even there I could not now be at peace: for thither should I carry corroding thought, the pangs of disappointed love, the remembrance of abused confidence, ingratitude and ill requited friendship.— Strange scenes have passed, my friend, since I wrote you last; I have hovered on the brink of eternity, from whence I was only snatched to be the victim of future misery; but let me pursue some method in my narrative and carry you back to the time when the receipt of Amelia's letter hurried us to proceed as expeditiously as possible to Aix to catch the parting sigh and receive the dying blessing of my last dear parent, my more than mother. Every preparation necessary for our departure was soon made, when the evening previous to the day on which we were to set out, Rooksby came into my dressing room, where I was busy in making some necessary arrangements with the housekeeper, and bidding her quit the room sat down beside me, and looking with more complacency than he had lately done, when addressing me, said, “I have unknown to you Meriel made a little addition to our party to the continent, and flatter myself it will not be disagreeable.”—I believe I looked surprized when I replied, “had our journey been one of pleasure I could certainly have no objection to any person, whom he should think proper to join us, but on so mournful an occasion I must suppose the presence of a stranger”— “It is not a stranger,” said he (interrupting me eagerly,) “it is poor Clara.” “Clara, sir?” in a tone of angry surprize. “Yes, my dear,” he answered hesitatingly, “She is in a bad state of health; I met her lately by accident. She cannot well afford so long a journey; and it is a good opportunity.” “Rooksby said I,” fixing my eyes upon his face: I think you know me well enough to be certain that if Clara is really ill and in want, she has a claim to every tender office of humanity from me as a fellow-creature, but”— “Nay, Meriel, no buts: surely (affecting a smile) “you are not jealous?”—“No, sir, you may rest quite easy on that head. I cannot think so meanly of you as to suppose after what had passed you would again be the dupe of an artful woman; for however my compassion may have been awakened toward Clara, I cannot help thinking her a woman capable of the basest duplicity.” “She is going to be married to Belger,” said he, endeavoring to hide his evident embarrassment under the mask of carelessness. “But I hope, sir, he is not to join us!” said I, reddening with indignation at the remembrance of past injuries, which I could now trace to their right source. “No, he will follow Clara to Aix, and if my mother dies, we shall all spend the winter in Paris.” The evident composure with which he mentioned such an afflicting circumstance, cut me to the soul.—“You speak of your mother with great indifference,” said I, and the tears gushed from my eyes. “Indifference, no, indeed I am extremely sorry; but you know, my dear, she is an old woman, and we must expect it, and that you know prepares us for the stroke, and prevents the shock we should otherwise feel. I have been thinking,” continued he after a little pause, “that I shall have the Hall pulled down next summer and built in a more modern stile.” I turned from him with silent contempt and resting my cheek upon my hand gave a loose to melancholy reflections. Celia I have been deceived in this man. He has no heart, no sensibility; every feeling of his soul is absorbed in self. Why, why was my fate united to such a man. I was roused from my reverie by a loud knock at the door.— “That is Clara,” said he, starting up. “I desired she would sleep here, that we might be ready to set off together in the morning.” I felt a faint chillness seize me as he spoke. I believe my voice faultered as I said, go down then and receive her; I will just take one more look at my dear little girl and join you immediately.” When he had left the room I sunk motionless the sopha. “Good heaven,” said I, “and is it come to this. Can it be possible, that the man whom I have promised to love and honour should thus forget what is due to me, to his child and to himself? But I will not judge too rashly, continued I, rising and drying my eyes. Perhaps they may not be guilty. Jealousy magnifies every object, and construes even laudable actions into crimes.” I then visited the nursery and having passed a few minutes in caressing my little Clementina, I descended to the drawing room where I found Clara negligently seated on a sopha by Rooksby, and Susan Mossop playing on the Piano Forte. Clara rose from her seat, coloured and hesitatingly said something about intrusion. I confess I was not less embarrassed myself; however I paid her the civilities necessary as being my guest and we immediately went to supper, soon after which I retired on pretence of making some further preparations, and having given orders about an apartment for Clara, I sat down and wrote a few lines to Susan requesting, as she intended staying in town, till she heared from us the result of our voyage and whether we returned or past the winter on the continent, that she would be particularly attentive to the child, and in case of her father's sending for her begged she would accompany her to Paris. This I did by letter, being sensible I should have no time to speak to her in the morning; and I did not think proper to send for her up stairs at that time. Early in the morning our post coach was at the door, and by six o'clock Mr. Rooksby, Clara, myself and Lester my woman were seated in it; and we proceeded with all imaginable speed to Dover. Rooksby immediately on our arrival sent to speak to the master of a Packet. We found it was impossible to think of embarking till the next morning, and were informed by the man that a gentleman and lady just arrived from town had taken their passage on board his vessel. While we continued talking, a gentle tap at the door interrupted us, and on its being opened who should enter but Mrs. Kingly. It was a most agreeable surprize to me, though I believe not so to Rooksby. “Well met my dear cousin,” said she, affectionately saluting me, “it is fortunate that we should both be travelling the same way. I saw your livery in the yard and immediately made my enquiries.” Kingly is gone out, so you see I took the opportunity and eloped to you; but when he returns I am sure he will be as happy as myself to pay you his respects.” While she was speaking she did not notice who was in the room, and, indeed, Clara sat in an obscure corner by the fire, but as she finished the last sentence, turning hastily round she saw her; but not recognizing her immediately cried, “I fear I am guilty of rudeness, you have company.” —“No one particular,” said I. It is only Mrs. Moreton.” Clara was now under the necessity of rising; Mrs. Kingly started and curtsying formally, while she gave Rooksby a most expressive look, said she could not have expected to see Mrs. Moreton in this party, not knowing we were acquainted. I really felt for Clara; her colour varied from red to pale and from pale to red, till I thought she would have sunk. Rooksby looked mortified, and I only slightly said, that Mrs. Moreton having but indifferent health wished to try the air and weather of Aix, and we having an empty seat in the coach I had offered it to her. —Mrs. Kingly looked inquisitive, as much as to say, “do you know who she is.” But she repressed the impulse of curiosity and made enquiries after my dear mother, whom she did not know till then, was in so dangerous a state. In about an hour Kingly came in, when after the first salutations were past, he began to recognize Clara, I think it would be impossible to give you an adequate idea of the anger and contempt that agitated his expressive countenance, her presence was a restraint upon us all, it checked conversation, we were for some moments silent and embarrassed—she saw it and guessing the vol. iii. N cause, complained of weakness and fatigue and ringing for a light retired to her chamber. She was no sooner gone than Kingly cried “why Mrs. Rooksby, how long have you been acquainted with that woman.” “Some time,” I replied affecting as much ease as possible. “Had you any knowledge of her before you were married?” “O yes, I knew her very well; come I know what you would say, but I shall stop you at once; her former errors are nothing to me; at present she is in distress. It was in my power to render her a trifling service, and I only followed the dictates of humanity.” “Neglecting those of common prudence,” interrupted he tartly. “Pshaw! nonsense,” I replied laughing, “do not let us talk any more about her.” “You are the most unaccountable woman,” said he, “that ever existed, I declare if almost half your life is not an inexplicable riddle.” “My dear,” said Mrs. Kingly, to turn the conversation, “my cousins have taken their passage in the same packet with us; so we shall cross the channel together.” This had the desired effect; we insensibly fell into mutual enquiries concerning the motives of our intended voyage: the conversation became by degrees cheerful, and Clara was for the moment forgot. I found that Mr. and Mrs. Kingly were merely on a jaunt of pleasure, and that we should have their company no farther than Calais, as they intended to proceed to Brussels. But, my dear Celia, vain are the appointments of man; we look forward to many coming years, we mark out plans of future pleasure and enjoyment: and cry, Thus we will do, and thus. When suddenly the unexpected blasts of adversity pass over us, the beauteous vision fades before our sight, while darkness clouds and tempest shut the expected joys forever from our view, and hurl them far beyond our reach. Like some poor hind, who during the fatigues of the day, had looked often wishfully toward a distant shady grove, where he might repose from the scorching noon-day sun.— “When my daily task is ended,” says he, “I will retire there, and as I rest my weary limbs, enjoy the cool refreshing breezes as they pass over the banks of flowers.” These reflections sweeten his toil, and he tastes a thousand times by anticipation the pleasures he expects to enjoy. At length the hour arrives, he quits his labour and hastily flies to the scene of fancy, promised bliss. “How delightful is the cooling shade,” he cries, as he draws near the grove; “how charming the gurgling of the clear stream that glides over the pebbles and falls into a bason formed by nature; how delicious the fruit that hangs from the trees and courts the hand to gather them. Oh! I could live and die in so sweet a place. How happy I shall be, when I reach it, and stretch my weary limbs on the soft grassy turf.”—Alas! poor swain, dost thou not see the sun is sunk beneath the hills, the gloom of evening comes on apace, and e'er thou canst reach thy desired haven, the clouds of night will obscure its beauties from thy view, and the chilly dews prevent your taking the repose you so ardently wish for. My dear Celia, I am at present unable to proceed; when I recover my spirits, I will again resume my pen, till then farewel. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LII. MERIEL to CELIA. IN CONTINUATION. Paris, January 30, 1784. We passed the night as proposed at Dover, and at an early hour were called to go on board the packet, the wind and tide both favouring us. We embarked before it was well light, and the wind freshening as we proceeded we were soon obliged to retire to our cabins, being seized with the sickness incident to those, who are unused to the boisterous element.—For some time we were too ill to pay much attention to the motion of the vessel, but at length I thought it was very violent, and enquired of Kingly, if it was usual to be so much tossed about in crossing the channel; his reply alarmed me; “the wind is changed,” said he, “and the clouds threathen a boisterous day; we shall make good sailors of you all, for I do not N 2 think you will reach Calais to-day, at least not till late in the evening.” Soon after this the wind increased to a tremendous degree, and I saw by Kingly's countenance that he was uneasy. He went frequently upon deck; then returned to the cabin, endeavoured to chear us, and said he had advised the Master to turn back as the wind was so much against us, and we should not feel the surges so much, when we went before it. Happy would it have been for us all, if this advice had been taken while day-light remained; but the man was obstinate, and continued beating about till nearly the close of day; then finding it impossible to make his intended port, attempted to return to Dover. As night came on, the storm increased, and though so late in the season was attended with the most vivid lightning and heavy claps of thunder; the sea was unusually agitated, the wind varying almost every instant and resting at no settled point. It is impossible, my dear Celia, to give you an adequate idea of the horrors of our situation in so small a vessel, driving about at the mercy of the waves and wind in a night, the pitchy darkness of which was only alleviated by lightning, which served to give us momentary views of the surrounding dangers. And how shall I tell my dear Celia, that in the midst of this distress and terror, I had one pang to encounter more acute by far than the near approach of expected death. Rooksby attached himself entirely to Clara. All his care, all his anxious solicitude was expressed for her. We had all risen from our beds, Kingly supported his wife in his arms. “My dear boys,” said she, “Heaven protect them.”—“Heaven will protect us all, I hope my love,” said he, passing his hand across his eyes. Rooksby sat in a distant corner of the cabin beside Clara, who rested her head upon his shoulder. Sad and solitary, I supported myself against a table, that was fastened to the cabin floor, and resigning myself to that Power, who could in an instant either rescue us from impending death, or plunge us at once into eternity—thus gave the reigns to reflection. Through every scene of my past life, how large has been my portion of misery, and how small comparatively, my allotment of joy: then why, coward soul, dost thou shrink from the friendly stroke, that will set thee free from the heavy clog of mortality, and lift thee above these regions of transitory, fading joys, to one where pleasure will be immutable, unchangeable and can never end!—Oh! Almighty Father of the Universe, weary as my pilgrimage has been, I acknowledge thy mercies have been ever beyond my deserts; to thee then do I commit myself—do with me as thou wilt—only; Oh! benignant Creator, grant me a portion of meekness and resignation equal to my afflictions. Thou art the Father of the fatherless; under thy protecting care my child will ever be secure. Do thou never forsake her in the hour of trial, and of thy mercy, grant she may never forget thee. Forgive my manifold offences, as from my soul I pardon every offence I may have received from my fellow-creatures. As these reflections passed through my mind, I felt a calm serenity take possession of my soul. I looked with an eye of complacency on Clara and Rooksby, whose horrors were depicted on their pale countenances, I even wished them peace of mind and fortitude to meet the impending danger as they ought. This world seemed fleeting from before my eyes, and I looked forward with humble hope, to that which was to come. “Chearily! chearily! my dear cousin,” said Kingly, taking my hand, which hung motionless by my side, “come, come, we are worth half a dozen dead folks yet.— 'Tis a tight little vessel—my life for it, we weather the storm, and this will be a seasoning for you. You will not be easily frightened after this.” “My dear Mrs. Rooksby,” said Mrs. Kingly, laying her hand on that of mine, which her husband held, “how much reason you have, to hate me, and all my family.” “Hush,” said I, (frightened, least she was going to reveal my secret) believe me, I love and respect all of your family, whom I have ever known.” “Do not say so, thou much injured woman, look there, (pointing to Rooksby) You cannot esteem that wretch, and yet you are linked to him for life, while the only man capable of rewarding virtue like yours: but no matter, 'tis I have done it all, and I deserve to be unhappy.” I was greatly distressed to hear her talk in this manner. But before I could interrupt her, she thus continued. “We are now, my dear cousin, hovering on the brink of eternity. Which of us, or whether any may escape the horrors of this awful night, heaven alone can tell; but we have both children. Promise me then my friend, should you survive, to be a mother to my poor babes, while they shall require a mother's tender care: and should it be my fate to escape and yours to perish; here in my Maker's sight, I swear to consider your Clementina as my own child.” She had hardly spoke, when a severe shock which the vessel received convinced us we had struck on some rocks, and immediately from the deck issued a confused noise of “lost! gone! all is over!” Rooksby started from his seat and clasping Clara in his arms, rushed upon the deck: Kingly did the same by his wife. The love of life still prevailed over the sense of misery and I followed them as well as I was able, crawling on my hands and knees up the steps. Kingly met me just as I had reached the top and taking me in his arms carried me to his wife. Here a new scene of horror discovered itself; the day had begun to dawn just enough to shew us that we were on a reef of rocks which ran a considerable distance from the shore, and that the rage of the breakers, while the wind continued so violent would prevent any boat from coming to our assistance. “See,” cried Mrs. Kingly, “there is no hope.” I could not answer.—We sunk upon the deck folded in each others arms, Kingly knelt beside and endeavoured to support us, and thus in silent agony, we waited the expected shock when our vessel would fall to pieces. But it was near two hours before this event took place. At length unable to withstand the repeated shocks, she parted and I saw Rooksby and Clara plunged into the waves. My terrors and grief here became too great for human nature to support and I lost all sense of my sufferings. How long I remained insensible I cannot tell, but on recovering my recollection, I found myself alone on the wreck, slightly fastened to it by a small cord, that was passed round my waist and tied to a ring on the remaining part of the deck. The terrors which at that moment took possession of my mind, are still too fresh in my memory to suffer me to proceed. Adieu, MERIEL. END OF THE THIRD VOLUME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LIII. MERIEL to CELIA. IN CONTINUATION. Paris, Feb. 2d. 1784. I continued in this situation but a few moments—when I heard a faint voice call “Meriel,” I turned my head and saw Kingly emerging from the sea and holding by part of the wreck—“Oh, Heavens!” said I, “are you alive then, and is there any chance of escaping?”—“Some little chance,” said he, coming near me and beginning to nutie the cord that was round me. “But where is Mrs. Kingly?”—“Safe, I hope,” he replied, “I have conveyed her on board a coasting vessel, which you may see at no great distance from us; but which cannot come nearer on account of the wind blowing strong in shore, and the sea running so high a boat could not live in it. Come, my dear Meriel, throw off the most cumbrous part of your dress, the chance of saving you is but very small; yet, should I be so happy, I shall esteem myself blest beyond expression, and should I fail, I shall at least have the satisfaction of dying with the only woman I ever loved with ardency and sincerity.” “No, Kingly,” said I, “if my life can only be preserved at the hazard of your's, leave me, I beseech you, to my fate. I am a poor forlorn creature of no consequence to any one:—here let me lay down the burthen of painful existence!—Do you return to your amiable wife. You may alone survive the fury of the waves; but encumbered with me, it will be impossible. Go, my kind, my dear friend, be a father to my child, and sometimes think on her unhappy mother.” “Cease, dear Meriel, cease, thus to wound my heart, and trifle with the precious moments in which I may snatch you A 2 from impending death. I once had fondly hoped to live only to render you happy;— but since fate has ordered it otherwise, I will preserve your life or perish in the attempt.” “Oh Kingly,” I replied, “leave me, let me die while I am innocent. This generous conduct awakens all the softness of my soul, and should I live, I shall live only to endure the tortures of hopeless love, rendered doubly agonizing by the pang of conscious guilt.” “Dearest, best of women,” said he, “let me but preserve you, and certain I am that the rectitude of the heart that can harbour such fears will ever preserve you from the guilt it dreads.” The wind now seemed a little to abate. I plainly saw the vessel coming nearer— “Now is the time,” said he, almost forcibly tearing off my upper garments, and binding a long shawl tight round my waist, he fastened it to his arm, and catching me up plunged into the water. I now became once more insensible, nor do I remember the least circumstance that followed, till I awoke, as it were, from a profound sleep, and found myself in a bed on board a small dirty vessel. I raised my head from the pillow and the first object which met my eyes, was Kingly on the opposite side of the cabin, apparently dead.—Mrs. Kingly with a pale haggard countenance hanging over him; and stretched on a mattress, which was spread on the cabin floor, lay Clara and Rooksby just recovering from a state of insensibility. Weak as I was I desired to be lifted from the bed and crawling to that on which my preserver lay, I began to enquire what means had been used for his recovery. I found every proper, every probable method had been tried without effect; they also informed me, that he was alive, when they took us up, but immediately on his getting on board, nature exhausted with the exertions he had made to save me, had given way at once, and he sunk lifeless on the deck. Tortured almost to madness by this account, I entreated them to renew their applications—nay, weak and exhausted as we were, both Mrs. Kingly and myself joined our endeavours, while Rooksby and Clara drank a little brandy and water, and being covered up warm, fell into a profound sleep. For more than two hours we continued our applications without the least appearance of success; at length I was convinced I felt a faint palpitation of the heart. I mentioned my hopes to his wife, who thought the same. This gave us fresh courage, and in less than another hour we had the superlative felicity of seeing him open his eyes. The rapturous expressions of joy that burst from Mrs. Kingly on this token of returning animation are better imagined than described, nor was mine far short of what she expressed.— No sooner were we ascertained of perfect success by his gently pressing our hands and faintly articulating, “God bless you both,” than bursting into tears of the most exulting rapture, we sunk on our knees, and as we wept on each others bosom, poured forth our thanks to that benignant Power, who had crowned our humble exertions with success. Never Celia! no never! till that moment did I fully comprehend what real joy was: the tide of delight that rushed upon my heart when I heard him articulate the words “God bless you,” more than compensated for all the anguish I had ever endured. The vessel which had taken us up, was bound to Calais, whither it now bent its course; the elements growing much calmer, and the wind becoming more favourable, and we were once more safe on Terra Firma by three o'clock the next day. I find the place, on which we were wrecked is a dangerous reef on the Suffex coast, fortunately, only one life was lost and that was poor Lester, as the vessel which preserved us seeing our distress came as near as they possibly could in hopes of rendering us some assistance; Rooksby is an expert swimmer and Clara a woman of intrepid spirit. We resolved on staying a day or two at Calais to recruit our spirits. Indeed we all found ourselves astonishingly recovered after a good nights rest, except Mrs. Kingly, who appeared weak and languid, was unable to sit up and in the course of the day was seized with alarming faintings. Medical assistance was called in, but they declared her frame had received so severe a shock that in all human probability she would fall into a rapid decline; however change of scene, chearful company, and invigorating medicines might prove great restoratives.—This was a heavy stroke to poor Kingly. We were unable to stay any longer than the next day with him and it was evident that his Margaret would not be able to travel so early. But there was no alternative; my mother's danger pressed us to pursue our journey, and accordingly the next morning we took leave of the drooping patient angel, and her afflicted husband, and set forward for Aix, flattering ourselves that a few days would bring them to join us. On our arrival at Aix, Clara left us, and we proceeded to my mother's. Amelia met us at the door. “Is she yet alive?” said I eagerly pressing forward. “She is,” replied Amelia, but greatly distressed. “We heard a packet was lost and feared it was the one in which you had embarked.”—Before I could answer I found myself in Mrs. Rooksby's chamber. The dear woman held out her hand to me as I entered; but was unable to speak. Rooksby approached her bed-side, took her other hand, and pressed it to his lips with reverence; but we all remained silent, I was pleased to see he still retained sensibility enough to be shocked at his mother's altered appearance. When she was a little recovered, “my dear children,” said she, pressing our hands, “it diffuses a transient gleam of pleasure over my heart to see you once more, and to see you safe and happy; how have you left my sweet Clementina, was she well? does she remember her grandmother?”—I assured her she was in health, and if any thing could remain on her infant mind, it must be the sense of her grandmother's kindness and affection.—She smiled approbation, then turning to Rooksby— “Clement,” said she, “you are arrived in good time to close my eyes and to smooth my passage to the grave, by passing an act of amnesty with your amiable relation Captain Onslow. Come, promise me that the trifling cause of your dispute shall be no more remembered, and that you will rank him among the choicest of your friends. I know he longs to convince you, that his affection toward you is unaltered.” “Your wish, my dear madam,” he replied, “must be to me a law. All our former differences are from this moment forgotten.” —“'Tis well,” said she; “then to-morrow I hope to see my dear Miss Sidney exchange the name of virgin for that of wife. I shall then have nothing more to wish in this world. Amelia made no affected objections to this proposal, and that evening Captain Onslow took his tea with us. When the articles were signed, in which he settles on my dear Amelia, five thousand pounds, which was the bequest Mrs. Rooksby mentioned to have made in her will; he also presented her with a very handsome watch, a pair of bracelets sat with brilliants and a pair of diamond earings. The next morning she accepted his hand at the altar with that modest reserve, free from every prudish affectation of bashfulness, which ever distinguishes the real woman of sense. From that time no material occurrence took place for three or four days; only that I observed my mother seemed more chearful, and I flattered myself that our united attentions might contribute to her restoration, I carefully concealed not only from her, but even from Amelia, the cause I had for sorrow, as I knew it would pain their friendly hearts, without in the least relieving the anguish of my own; though I knew by the frequent and long absences of Rooksky, that the chief part of his time was devoted to Clara. But why, thought I, should I give my dear Amelia a bad opinion of a state, into which she had just entered, by revealing to her the art, the duplicity cruelty and perfidy of which man is capable. Will it not lead her to fear a future change in the husband, who is now so fondly attached to her. Was not Rooksby once as fond of me, Oh! had he been like Kingly, hither tended all my reflections on the subject, I was terrified to find myself making these comparisons and strenuously endeavoured to chase from my mind the only object on which it could dwell with delight and grateful tenderness. But these ideas were soon interrupted by the intrusion of some still more painful. My dear Mother was one morning seized with a fit of coughing and expired before I could reach her apartment, though I was called the instant the attendants perceived her danger, though her death was hourly expected by those about her, I had vainly slattered myself she might recover; I therefore felt her sudden departure the more severely, and as if my heart was not already overcharged with affliction on the second day after her decease, Amelia entered my apartment with a letter open in her hand. There was an air of melancholy and surprise about her countenance, which awakened my curiosity. My thoughts instantly reverted to England and my child. “Is Clementina ill”—cried I, eagerly, snatching at the letter.—“No!” she replied, folding it up and putting it in her pocket, while she calmly seated herself beside me, “the letter is not from England.”— “Are you sure of that Amelia,” said I, looking at her with a scrutinizing eye. “Perfectly so, my dear Meriel, but have you no other friends, in whose welfare you are interested beside those you left in England.” “Perhaps it is from Kingly?”—“You are right,” she replied, “and the contents are so much less dreadful than your mind forboded, that I think I may commit it to your perusal.” “Poor Margaret is worse, I fear,” said I, as I took the letter. She made me no answer, and I read it with a composure at which I have since been astonished. I send VOL. IV. B you a copy, and believe me, Celia, every line as I retraced it, has been wet with my tears. Farewell, my dear girl, methinks you must be weary of a correspondent who writes only on melancholy themes.—Ah! my Celia, the miserable know no luxury equal to that of dwelling on their sorrows, and weeping over their source. In this you have ever indulged me, and it is a privilege I shall not easily forego.—Adieu! God bless you. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LIV. MR. KINGLY to MISS SIDNEY.[1] [1] He did not know of her marriage with Captain Onslow. Calais, Jan. 13th, 1784. Miss sidney is the friend of Meriel Howard (for I will not call that dear woman by the name of her unworthy husband;) to her then I may address myself and pour forth the sorrows that lie heavy at my heart. Oh, Amelia! unless you could for a moment place yourself in my situation, you can have no idea of my wretchedness. My wife! my friend! my lovely! and beloved! Margaret is no more. I have taken up my pen to inform you of her placid, her heavenly end:—but I feel I am unequal to the task.—I must pause.—My tears will flow.— in such a cause the bravest need not blush to indulge their sensibility. I am more composed—I have gazed on the serene countenance of my departed angel, and gathered fortitude from the remembrance of her virtues; from that blessed assurance, that the stroke which pierces my heart has secured to her felicity which will never end. The disorder which alarmed us so much, by its appearance, before Rooksby left Calais, terminated in an inflammation on the lungs and a putrid sore throat occasioned by the cold the dear creature had taken and the agitation her spirits had undergone. It made rapid advances. She knew her own danger, and seemed resigned to quit the world, only that her heart yearned for her children: but even when she thought of them, her pious soul extracted consolation from the reliance she placed on a divine guardian and protector to whom she solemnly recommended them. Just before the last awful scene was closed, she called me to her bed side, “Kingly,” said she, “I am going.—Four years of superlative felicity is as much as humanity can expect. I am resigned to my fate, and humbly thank my bountiful Creator that I have not lived to know the privation of your affection. That, my dear Frederic, I fear would have been a trial to which my fortitude would have proved unequal. I need not recommend my children to your care. I am satisfied you will never forget you are a father.” I assured her of my constant attention and undeviating affection to those dear pledges of our love, and begged she would not too much exhaust herself by talking. “I must speak, my love,” said she, “Alas! in a few hours that power will be denied me. I have something of importance to say. You have been vilely deceived. Mrs. Rooksby ever loved you.—She is truth and purity itself.”— She was proceeding, when a kind of convulsion seized her—and she recovered only to speak in incoherent sentences—“Be the unalterable friend—She is worthy —In my cabinet you will”—She endeavoured to finish the sentence, but in vain—her eyes closed—her gentle spirit sled forever!— The anguish of my heart is better imagined than described. Though I ever endeavoured B 2 to promote the happiness of my Margaret; yet, when I reflect that I did undoubtedly love another, and that however, by the most grateful attention, I endeavoured to veil my feelings from her, yet she knew the situation of my heart, and knew the worth of the object. I cannot but fear it hurt her sensibility and preyed upon her spirits. I shall immediately return to England to attend her remains to their last dreary mansion, settle my children, dismiss my servants and solicit immediate employment; for idleness will only be the nurse of affliction, and it is my duty to live and endeavour to recover my spirits that I may attend to the dear bequests of my Margaret, be father! mother! every dear relation to her children, and the firm friend of—I need not write her name. I have sometimes thought her capricious and inconsistent, but the words “you have been viley deceived,” have awakened sentiments in my bosom, which it is improper to indulge, tell her, my dear madam that while I live, I shall consider myself as bound to support! honour! and protect her! Alas! what right have I to protect her? is she not the wife of another?—Yes she is,— but that other is a villain, as such every man of honour and sensibility has a right to step forward in her defence. “She is purity itself”—true but that purity cannot excel the pure the friendly affection that glows in my breast. A person who looks not beyond the surface of things, may think that these expressions are an insult, a sure mark of disrespect, to the memory of my departed Margaret, but you my dear madam will consider them as they are meant a proof of my considence in her veracity, a wish to fulfil her last desire. Meriel is the wife of Rooksby.—My soul ever abhorred seduction of any kind; but to seduce a wife! a mother! horror! infamy!—the wealth of Indus, the joys of paradise would not tempt me to such a measure. No, Margaret no! my beloved partner. Meriel may be the adopted mother of your children, may implant in their minds those virtues which have supported her under all her afflictons, but for me, I will seek employment abroad, and fly from trials, which might be too powerful for me. I have just received Rooksby's letter informing me of the death of his mother, and your union with Captain Onslow. May heaven shower its choicest blessings on you; may costancy love and peace crown your nuptials, and may you never know the pangs which at this moment rends the heart of FREDERIC KINGLY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LV. MERIEL to CELIA. Paris, February 7th, 1784. My dear Celia may perhaps be surprized that we did not attend the remains of our revered mother to England: but the obstinacy of Rooksby was not to be overcome, and I was afraid to leave him lest by my absence I should appear to give a sanction to a connection which though I could not entirely prevent, I was determined as much as possible to interrupt. My friendly Amelia and her husband were returning to England, and proposed seeing the last duties fulfilled to my beloved parent, while I heavily and unwillingly attended Rooksby to Paris, where we were soon joined by Clara and Belger, the former of whom has now thrown aside all restraint, appearing publicly as the mistress of Rooksby. Her house and establishment are elegant; she gives splendid entertainments, and though her infamy is well known, she is courted, followed and caressed by the fashionable world; while I am left a poor solitary creature, in the midst of a busy multitude, without friend or comforter. The parting with Amelia was like severing soul and body. I felt as if in losing her, I lost all support, for though I am sensible, that you, my dear Celia, compassionate all my sufferings, yet secluded as you are from the world, you cannot participate the sorrows of which you have no idea. I remember, once in the moment of exulting happiness, I condemned the torpid gloom of a monastic life. Alas! have I not since had sufficient cause to wish, that torpor, that insensibility had been mine. Yet why should I repine? why utter so ungrateful a wish, since had I never mingled in the active scenes of life though I might have escaped the knowledge of a Clara, Belger, or Rooksby, I should also never have known the transcendent worth of Amelia Sidney and Frederic Rainsforth. Rooksby proposes remaining here till June, I could almost wish time would double the rapidity of his motion and hasten the hour when I shall again embrace my Clementina. Heaven protect my child, and shield her from the afflictions that have almost bowed to the earth her unhappy mother. Oh! my friend, hard as the task would be, I would sooner resign her to him who gave her being, than see her live to be a prey to sorrows, which, though sympathy may soften, nothing but death can relieve. Adieu, MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LVI. MERIEL to CELIA. Paris, March 19th, 1784. I fear my dear friend that Rooksby is in the high road to ruin, Clara sets no bounds to her extravagance. She gives splendid balls, concerts composed of the first performers, and pretends to countenance all the literati of the age; besides she is an amateur in painting, and it is almost incredible what sums she squanders, in these pursuits. My dear little girl has now been with me three weeks. Susan Mossop came over with her, Susan is a lively girl and immediately attracted the notice of Belger. It gave me pain to see it, as I was too well acquainted with the principles of the man to think he meant an honourable attachment, and in a friendly manner warned her to beware. Would you believe it? my attention to her happiness was construed into jealousy, and from that moment she has treated me with contempt and insolence. I am just informed a gentleman desires to speak with me. It is something unusual for me to have a visitor especially a male one. It may be some English acquaintance I must leave you my Celia for a short time. Oh heavens! how hard are my trials: when will the throbbings of my bosom cease! When I left my pen and descended into the drawing room, the door of which stood partly open, I saw sitting with his back toward me, a gentleman in deep mourning. He arose as I entered. Conceive my surprize.—It was Kingly. “Mr Kingly,” said I, endeavouring at a look of composure, while my pale countenance and tremulous voice betrayed my emotions.—He took my hand, led me to a sopha and seating himself beside me endeavoured in vain to restrain the tears that trembled in his expressive eyes. “I have obtained an appointment, my dear Cousin” said he recovering himself “and in a few months shall sail on a three years station to America: but I could not leave Europe, without taking a personal leave of the best of women and recommending to her care my dear boys, Heaven only knows what may be the fate of their father. Say, should I never return, will you be their mother, their counsellor, their friend? “Surely Kingly,” said I eagerly, “you cannot doubt my readiness to render them every service, within the narrow compass of my power. The friendship I bore their departed mother,s” “And is there nothing due to the affection with which you once honoured their unhappy father. Ah Meriel! your laudable deception is now of no avail: in my dear Margaret's cabinet I found a letter written by her own hand and addressed to me, in which she explains every part of your conduct, which had before appeared so mysterious. Yes my constant, my adored Meriel, I am now satisfied, that you must have thought me the basest of mankind, as I at one time believed you the most capricious of women: but I can easily trace the black mischief to the fountain head. Hester Mossop, had frequently made me advances, which it was impossible to mistake.s Need I tell you I slighted her. Ah! my vol. iv. C beloved Meriel, how amply has her arts revenged her slighted beauty.” He caught my hands, while I in vain endeavoured to suppress my tears; but unable to command my voice sufficiently to answer him, I continued silent and he proceeded. “My own disappointment, my own sufferings I have learned to bear without complaining; but your's, dear Meriel, torture me beyond imagination. I see you married to a man, who ungratefully throws from him a gem, which might add splendor to a diadem. I see you unhappy; and feel I have not the power to alleviate your sorrows. “Your friendly anxiety,” said I “does me honour; and while I possess the esteem of my friends I can never think myself totally unhappy. But you mistake, in thinking Mr. Rooksby”— “Pardon me Meriel, I know you would endeavour to draw a veil over his vices; but they are too glaring. All the world must see how you are injured!—Would to Heaven, Rooksby was not your husband, or that there was any way to oblige him to do you justice without iujuring your fame, which I would die to preserve unspotted.” “Ah, Kingly!” said I, “your life is too precious to be lightly thrown away. Consider your children—for their sake, for the sake of your friends, preserve it.” “And may I rank Mrs. Rooksby among those friends, who are interested in my safety?” “Do you doubt it Kingly? who is there on earth so dear?”—I paused—I recollected I was a wife—I was a mother!— The glow of self-reproach, crimsoned my face. He sunk on his knees before me. “Oh! most adored of womankind! am I still dear to thy heart?—Speak! finish the blessed sentence! say you still love me!— and I will live in the sweet hope that some happy moment may arrive, when every barrier will be removed!”—He pressed my hands to his bosom: my head sunk upon his shoulder and my tears flowed without restraint. Oh, my Celia! let the prude, the rigidly virtuous blame me: the affection of my heart at that moment triumphed! I looked back to the time when to love him was no crime! the felicity I might, have enjoyed in his society arose to my view! I felt, that spite of all resistance, I still loved him, and was still ardently beloved—but at the same moment, I remembered I could never be his.— “Believe me,” said I, “my heart has never wandered.” “Ten thousand thanks!” cried he, wildly kissing my hands. At that moment the door opened and Rooksby entered. To describe the scene that ensued would be impossible. I felt I had been to blame—I dared not assert my innocence, though I had forgotten myself but for a moment.—“Detested villian,” said he,” darting a fierce look at Kingly; “and you prevaricating wretch, where now is your boasted virtue?”—He at the same time seized me rudely by the arm: Kingly interposeds“Dare not to treat your wife injuriously—she is an angel.” “An angel of darkness, I believe,” said he, contemptuously, “but I shall expect to settle this matter in another place.” “Rooksby,” said Kingly, with an air of dignity, “you are the husband of Meriel Howard. I believe you do not doubt my courage: but worlds should not tempt me to lift my hand against your life.” “Base subterfuge—cowardly villain!”— cried the enraged Rooksby, and struck him. I saw no more. Sense forsook me and when I recovered, I found they had left the house together. I am dreadfully agitated: Six hours have I past in the most agonizing suspence; during which time, I have at intervals endeavoured to compose my perturbed spirits by writing:—But, alas! I can no longer proceed. Interested in the fate of both, should they fight, I am destined to be unhappy. Rooksby is returned—Kingly is dangerously wounded, and in a few hours my husband sets off for Italy. I return to England with my child; but Susan Mossop forsakes me in my distress and goes to Clara, where ruin and infamy, I fear, will soon overtake her. I shall write no more on this side the channel. Heaven grant that Kingly may recover, and Rooksby awaken to a sense of his errors. Then may the pale messenger of peace beckon me from this vale of sorrow to that blessed mansion, where the tear shall cease to slow, and the heart be eased of its anguish. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">C 2 LETTER LVII. MERIEL to CELIA. Glamorganshire, August 27th, 1784. The hasty scrawl I wrote on my first arrival in England,[2] [2] Does not appear. informed you of my safety; but there are many other things you no doubt wish to know, as you must have been surprized at my long silence. A variety of incidents have contributed to make me appear neglectful of my friend; but they are now all past, and I am settled in a little neat retreat far from the busy scenes of life, where my chief occupation is the care of my sweet girl. I think my Celia, after buffeting as I have done the wayes of adversity, the calm serenity of my little dwelling diffuses a degree of comfort over my heart, to which it has long been a stranger. On my arrival in England, I went immediately to our house in Harley-Street, where I spent a week in the most torturing suspence expecting every day to hear of Kingly's death, as I had desired a gentleman in Paris to inform me of that event immediately, if it should happen, or in case of his recovery, to let me know when he was out of danger. My dear Amelia came to me the day after my arrival and every tender attention, which friendship could bestow, I experienced from her and Captain Onslow. At length the long expected letter arrived and I read, to my surprize and joy, that Kingly was in a fair way of recovery. This was an infinite relief to my mind, and I began to regain some degree of composure, which was only interrupted by the idea of parting with my friend Mrs. Onslow, who was on the point of accompanying her husband to India; but the privation of her society was an event I was prepared to expect from the day of her marriage; I lamented it in silence, and only congratulated the dear woman on the felicitous prospects that seemed to await her, without damping her spirits by a mention of my sorrows of which her departure from England was not the least. She had not been gone above a month, when I was alarmed and terrified by an execution coming into the house, and on enquiring into my husband's affairs, learned that his folly and Clara's profligacy had involved him in irretrievable embarrassments; that he had mortgaged or sold almost all his property and could not command a thousand pounds clear in the world, except the estates which had been settled on me at my marriage and the small one in Glamorganshire, which he had presented to me previous to our union. I consulted with Mr. le Sage, a particular friend of Rooksby's whether any thing could be done to relieve him, and offered to cancel my marriage settlement; but of this he would not hear. However I determined to retrench every superfluous expense in my house-keeping, to discharge my servants and lay down my carriage. Having made this resolution, I instantly set about the execution of it, called in all my accounts and paid to the utmost of my power every thing due, I then told Mr. le Sage that I should leave London and did not wish my place of residence to be known to many of my acquaintance; but that I should esteem it a favour if he would inform me, whenever he heard of Rooksby, and forward to me any letters that might come from the continent. I then with only two servants set forward for Glamorganshire. I found the journey very fatiguing especially when I drew near its conclusion. My income was now very confined yet I thought two hundred a year would be a sufficient support for myself and child with economy, and would be a certain refuge for her, whenever I should be no more. As to my marriage settlement I did not consider it as my own, but held it merely with a view of being serviceable to my husband in any future emergency. Do not think, my dear Celia, I mean to insinuate that affection for Rooksby led me to act thus. No, that had long been extinct, gratitude had at one time awakened in my bosom an affection pure and tender, if not ardent, but his conduct since has entirely extinguished it, and whatever I do now proceeds from a motive of duty, and a consciousness of right. He is the father of my child. He is the man I have solemnly promised to prefer to all his sex. Oh! Celia! what an awful state is marriage and yet how thoughtlessly do many rush into it. How ought we to reflect before we take a promise it may not be in our power to keep. While I live I hope my actions will ever be the result of principle, and that principle rectitude. Let me perform my duty chearfully, and leave the event to heaven. But I am wandering. When I drew near the house which stands on my little farm, I was shocked to see how very desolate it appeared, it had been untenanted two years and only a young man and his mother lived in one part of it; the one looked after the farm; and the other milked the cows, made the butter and sent it to market. Part of the garden was cultivated but the largest half was over-run with weeds. Rooksby had not seen it for seven years past, and in that time it had been sadly neglected, so that though its original value had been two hundred pounds per year, it did not now produce half that sum. A cold chillness sezied my spirits as we drove up to the gate; the woman had been taught to expect me for I wrote to the young man, that a couple of bed-rooms might be prepared and well aired; the coach stopped, the door was opened and from the house come—judge who, my dear Celia. Why no other than my dear old nurse, Deborah Ellis. I do really believe, I screamed with joy when I saw her. She, poor old soul, had no remembrance of me; but stood curtsying, and fearing my ladyship was very much fatigued. I followed her into the house—a small parlour wore the appearance of comfort; a table was covered with a clean coarse cloth, and in a few moments Deborah brought in a couple of boiled chickens, a bottle of current wine, and every other appurtenance for dinner. I could not now withhold from discovering myself: but stopping her as she was about to leave the room, “Deborah,” said I,” have you forgot me Deborah.” A silent look of enquiry and surprize was her only reply. “Surely,” said I, “you must remember your poor little Meriel.—“Meriel madam! what my dear Miss Meriel Howard?”—“Yes Deborah, your own Meriel, pray speak to me, I am Meriel Howard.”—She laid her hand on my arm and looking earnestly in my face the large drops of joy chased each other down her aged countenance.— “I think you are like her,” said she, “but you are altered, you did not used to be so thin nor so pale.” Then clasping me in her arms she continued, “I know you now, for well I remember you was the child of affliction.— I then told her in as concise a manner as possible every occurrence that had passed since my removal to London, still carefully concealing every thing that might lead to the subject of my leaving so abruptly Woodbine cott, and the unhappy consequences that preceded it. But I can plainly discover she too well guesses the cause of that elopement.— She comforted and consoled me under my present circumstances, and declared she would never again be seperated from me. I learnt from her, that the mother of the young man who managed the farm, was her sister, that she was lately dead, and that she herself had come by her nephew's desire to get the rooms ready for his lady's coming; but she had, no thought of finding in that lady the dear little girl, whom she had nursed, and loved like a child of her own. You will readily imagine, my dear Celia, that the presence of Deborah greatly contributed to my comfort. I soon got settled, discharged my man servant, whom I had only engaged to accompany me on my journey, and with Deborah and Lucy, a young woman whom I had engaged to wait on myself and attend Clementina, I entered on an entire new way of life; and believe me, when I say, it is by far the most comfortable I have experienced for many years. Colin, Deborah's nephew, superintends the farm, which I flatter myself, will soon be in a flourishing state. My old fashioned casements are overun with jesmine and honey-suckle, and before my door, are a variety of roses, pinks, sweet-williams, and other flowers, which, though common are not less sweet, than the rare and expensive exotics that flourish in the green-houses of the first noblemen in England. My parlour and dining room are ormamented with pots of myrtle, geranium, mignionet, and balm of giliad; the furniture consisting only of plain oak tables and neat matted chairs. My bed chamber and that of my child, is furnished with white dimity, but made as plain as possible. Before I left London, I went to see Kingly's two children. They are in perfect health, and placed where I think they will meet with every tenderness and attention. I engaged the lady under whose care they are placed, to write frequently and inform me of their welfare; for should illness attack them, I should not hesitate a moment to fly to their assistance. The world might perhaps, blame me, yet surely, my Celia, the world must be more unfeeling than I have even yet found it, should the conduct of a woman incur its censure, who having a child of her own, loves and compassionates those who are deprived of a mother's tenderness. In this retreat then, my friend, I hope to pass some few years in tranquillity. Even if Rooksby returns to England, he will be accompanied by Clara and I should be only thought a troublesome intruder; therefore, unless he requires it, I will not leave my retirement. Could I be of any service to ward off any impending misfortune, or comfort him under affliction; should a declining state of health require the kind attention of a nurse, then will I fly on the wings of duty, and prove myself a wife and friend. But alas! I fear he may perhaps even quit the world without my either seeing him or knowing VOL. IV. D where he is; for he has not wrote to me since we parted at Paris, and knowing as I do his impetuous temper, I am sensible, especially connected as he is with such a woman as Clara, he may be drawn into dangerous quarrels. But I grow tedious on this subject, which is ever uppermost in my thoughts, and cruel as he has behaved to me, I daily offer up a prayer for his safety. Nay, sometimes I fear, least I have not loved him as I ought. Perhaps love so ardent as his, was quick sighted and could discover the difference between passion and friendship: yet, from the first of our acquaintance, I never attempted to deceive him or feign a tenderness I could not feel. Clara, I am certain has been the chief and only cause of alienating his affection from me.— I remember when I first knew her as Mrs. Moreton at Kensington, I told her in the unsuspected openness of my heart every circumstance of my my life, my sincere attachment to Rainsforth, my misfortunes, my rash and imprudent step to relieve my mother. These, perhaps, with aggravated circumstances have been repeated to Rooksby, and he has imputed my union with him to interested motives. Nay, he might even think the reluctance I shewed to it at first was the effect of art.— These reflections often lead me to think more favourably of his conduct than perhaps others will say it deserves. While I ever behaved to him in one uniform manner, tender, attentive, but calm and serene. Clara has no doubt affected the most impetuous passion and by this means has gained that ascendency over him which I greatly fear will end but in his total ruin or death. August 29th. I have just received a letter from Kingly. He is going on a three years station to America. May the God of Battles defend him. He had heard of Rooksby's misfortunes and sent me a letter of credit on his banker; but of this no necessity whatever, should tempt me to avail myself. No, Celia, I feel my heart too much oppressed already with the weight of obligation. I am already but too apt to make comparisons of what is, and what might have been my fate, and this shall be the last time I will indulge myself in writing of him to you. Speak of him, I cannot, as no person here knows him; and I will endeavour not to think of him, for when I remember that there is such a man, I must also remember that it was he first taught my heart affection, it was he who saved my life almost at the expense of his own, and that possessed as he is of every amiable quality, he is unhappy.—Oh! human nature, how weak thou art!— Poor unstable beings that we are, conscious of our errors, we suffer reason to take the reins for a moment, and renounce them! But, scarce has the renunciation past our lips, perhaps in the very instant of self applause, some trifling circumstance will awaken the feelings of our hearts, and we, imperceptibly, return to those very follies, the remembrance of which, had covered us with confusion!— Adieu!—dear Celia—remember me in your pious oraisons, and continue to let me hear from you. I shall write, but my letter will contain only the insipid detail of what passes at my solitaty habitation, or the, perhaps, not less insipid encomiums a fond mother will bestow in enumerating the growing perfections of a darling child.— Oh! may that child live to be my comforter. I will hide her from the world, and all its allurements: So, may she never! never! feel its excruciating pains!—I will make my will, Celia, and leave this idol of my soul to your care, in case it should please Heaven to deprive her of her mother. You, I know, will teach her that in the bosom of retirement, she alone can find peace. Oh! how blest the heart whose sensibility has never been awakened, who, though dead to all the joys of love or friendship, feels not the pang of disappointment, or the piercing sting of ingratitude!—Once more, Adieu!—May Heaven ever bless you. MERIEL. Between this letter and the next there are several omitted, which Mrs. Rooksby wrote to her friend during her residence in the country, where she continued four years, unnoticed by her husband and forgotten by a world, where her virtues had never been esteemed as they deserved. As these letters contain nothing material it was not judged necessary to print them. Mr. Rooksby's return to England called her again into the busy scenes of life, and as her distressing situations are most feelingly described by her own pathetic pen—we here again take up the correspondence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">D 2 LETTER LVIII. MERIEL to CELIA. London, Dec. 13th, 1788. Have you never heard, my dear Celia, that mariners, who are accustomed to the vicissitudes of the unstable element, never experience a long succession of calm serene weather, but they hold themselves prepared for a heavy storm. The sea is deceitful and the inexperienced sailor may be lost e'r he is aware of danger. This has been my case. Lulled into security by the calm I had been allowed to enjoy I fondly flattered myself that I should sink quietly into oblivion, forgetting and forgotten by the world. The accounts I heard of my husband were vague and improbable. I was at a lost to think how he subsisted. I was told he had sunk into the detested character of a sharper and gambler. He never wrote to me, never enquired for me; nay, I was once informed that he had spread a report of my death. A few days after my last to you as I was instructing my little darling in the first rudiment of the English language, a letter was brought me which I enclose for your perusal. MR. LE SAGE to MRS. ROOKSBY. MADAM, IT is with infinite regret I take up my pen to inform you of what I am sensible will give you the most lively affliction and disturb that tranquillity, which through the exertions of your own good sense you have for some time enjoyed. Mr. Rooksby is in England. He arrived at my house last night, extremely ill both in body and mind; he informed me in a few almost incoherent words, that he had killed a man at Brussels, where he has resided for some time, that in the fray he met with a slight wound in his shoulder, which had never been properly dressed, as his servant had hurried him to England with the utmost rapidity, and that he himself was unwilling to stop after crossing the channel till he arrived in London. I found he was very much fatigued, and from the agitation of his spirits and anguish of the wound, very feverish. We persuaded him to go to bed and sent for a surgeon, who examined the wound and pronounced it slight; but in a bad way from being neglected. He was very restless all night, and towards morning I thought rather wild in his discourse, I asked him if I should send for you,—“send for who” said he, raising himself hastily, for “Mrs. Rooksby? for which of them,” said he, wildly “I have two wives.”—I thought this was a certain indication of delirium and forbore to answer him, but he caught hold of my hand and obliging me to sit down thus continued, “if you mean Meriel, I have injured her too much to expect she will come, and as to Harriet, or Clara—Oh! do not tell Clara where I am!”—He then appeared violently agitated and soon after raved in a very incoherent manner. I thought, madam, it was necessary you should be informed of his unhappy situation, and therefore send an express off with this immediately, requesting you will set off for town as quick as possible; your presence may in some measure calm his perturbed spirits, and be the means of a recovery, which I believe the Physician considers at present very doubtful. Fearing you might not be accommodated with cash for so long a journey, I have taken the liberty of inclosing a fifty pound note, which you can repay at your own convenience. I am Madam, with great respect, your humble servant, EDWARD LE SAGE. Welbeck Street, Sept. 9th, 1788. MERIEL, IN CONTINUATION. YOU will readily believe, that when the shock my spirits had received was a little subsided, I sat about hasty preparations for my journey: I took Lucy with me and left Clementina in the care of Deborah. I made but short stoppages on the road, taking but little refreshment, and no rest till I arrived in town. Anxiety kept me up, nor was I sensible of the fatigue I had undergone:—But when I alighted in Welbeck Street, and attempted to walk up stairs, I found the exertion was beyond my strength, and I sunk almost insensible on the landing place. Mr. Le Sage was very attentive and friendly, as was also his amiable daughter; and by their kindness I soon found myself able to enquire after poor Rooksby. They told me he was better, that he knew I was expected, and, that he was impatient to see me. I rellied my spirits, and having at the request of my kind host taken a glass of wine, I proceeded to the sick chamber. I approached the bed cautiously.—Good Heavens!—what havoc has intemperance and sickness made in his person? How little should I have known him for the blooming elegant Clement Rooksby, whom only seven years before I had accepted as my husband. Pale, emaciated, and haggard was his countenance; his words so weak they could not be understood. He fixed his eyes for an instant on me; his lips moved, he stretched one hand out toward me and with the other covered his face. I took the offered hand; compassion overpowered resentment; I raised it to my lips and wet it with my tears. “Oh! thou dear generous woman,” said he faintly, “I have not deserved this tenderness—I am a wretch, unworthy of your notice: but you are an angel of mercy come to whisper pardon to my soul that I may die in peace.” “You will live many years yet,” said I, “many years in comfort and health.” “Never,” said he, eagerly, “I do not wish to live. Health may return: but my heart will never know peace nor joy again; therefore. 'twere well, if it were cold and motionless. But, oh! my beloved—I do not deserve to live and I am afraid to die!” Here the nurse interposed, and I was forced to leave him; for while I stayed, he persisted in talking to me, which irritated the disorder. I had not left him long, when he sent to know if I had brought Clementina with me; and seemed greatly disappointed when he found I had not. His anxiety to see the child, pleased me, and tempted me to write to Deborah to come with her to town immediately. The tender assiduity, which inclination prompted me to show my poor Rooksby, accelerated his recovery and in about six weeks I had the pleasure of seeing him able to bear a removal to a small house we had taken at Pimlico. I had carefully avoided suffering him to dwell on past disagreeable circumstances and endeavoured by every means I could devise, to direct the melancholy I saw daily increasing; but my attempts were vain, and indeed had I known the real source of that melancholy, my own heart would have been equally oppressed. We had been in our new habitation, but a fortnight, when one morning as we were at breakfast; two men entered and arrested Rooksby for a debt of five thousand pounds. which he told me was a gaming debt, and the same which had involved him in the unlucky quarrel at Brussels as he suspected the person who won it of him, did not win it fairly. I cannot tell you what I felt. Weak and low as he was, it was death to see him conveyed to a prison, yet that I knew must be the inevitable consequence of the arrest, as I had no means to extricate him from that and several others of a similar nature, for which he had been draw in to give his note. With a heart almost breaking I saw him depart, and then immediately sent for a lawyer, whom I determined to invest with power to sell the little property we possessed, I did not consult Mr. Le Sage. I knew his cold Philosophy would strongly oppose my giving up my settlements. Yet sure, my dear Celia, I should have been wrong to hesitate a moment, or out of a pretended care for the future welfare of my child to suffer her father oppressed with sickness and tortured by remorse, forsaken by those gay triflers, who once called themselves his friends, to waste the remainder of his wretched life in a prison. “When I had given every proper direction for the raising what money we could, and endeavouring to bring the unjust holders of his notes to some composition, I visited him in his sad abode and endeavoured to chear and comfort him. That duty fulfilled, I returned to my solitary home and taking my dear girl on my lap gave a free vent to tears which flowed from real anguish of heart. Deborah brought in my tea. She shut the windows, stirred the fire and twice attempted to speak; but the honest creature's own feelings were too acute to permit her to comfort me. My poor Clementina, from sympathy had laid her dear head on my bosom and mixed her tears with mine “Mamma is sick, Deborah,” said she. Deborah took her silently from me, wiped off the tears that trickled down her innocent face; once more attempted to speak, but unable to articulate turned hastily from me and wept aloud. How long vol. iv. E this scene of mute sorrow would have continued I know not; but we were aroused from it by a coach stopping and a loud rap at the door. I trembled, I knew not why; I wished not to see any visitors, yet had not presence of mind to forbid any one being admitted, and before I could compose my countenance or wipe away the traces of sorrow from my face the door opened and a most lovely young woman entered. Her dress was second mourning, neat in the extreme, and she was visibly pregnant. Her looks were characteristic of modesty and truth. Her manners at once attractive and commanding, such as she appeared to me at that moment, fancy now represents her to my mind, and I find, sorrowful as my heart is, it has yet a vulnerable part that feels for her afflictions. She curtsyed and with a look and voice humility entreated pardon for the intrusion, she had hoped to have found Mr. Rooksby at home. “He will not be at home to-night madam,” said I, as I entreated her to be seated, “but if you will favour me with your commands I will serve you to the utmost of my power.” “Pardon me, madam,” said she, “commands are not for the unfortunate, I came not to command but entreat.—To entreat Mr Rooksby will call to his rememberance an unhappy woman, who deprived of his frienship must be forever lost.” “If you mean Mrs. Millar, madam,” said I with some surprize. “I am astonished she could employ so respectable a person on so very improper a message.” “Alas! madam I do not know Mrs. Millar, I have indeed heard of her and that she had used Mr. Rooksby extremely ill, but it is not for her I would plead, it is for myself.” “Yourself,” cried I, in breathless agitation. “Does he owe you money.” “Oh no! no! he owes me succour and support, I am his wife! and he has forsaken me.” I believe the wildness of my looks terrified her; for she caught hold of my hand and thus proceeded.—“Dear madam, do not be angry, you perhaps are his sister, you blame the unequal alliance. I was poor, madam; but indeed, I will never disgrace the name he has honoured me with.” She might have proceeded longer without interruption. A sudden stupefaction seemed to deprive me of sense or feeling. This agravation of my calamities was more than I could bear, and nature sunk under the shock. She was alarmed and hastily rung the bell. The entrance of Deborah and the child awakened me to sensibility, and the tears which the dreadful discovery I had just made had suspended, now gushed forth afresh. I gave them free vent, and thanked heaven for the relief they gave my heart. When I became a little composed, I reflected on the sad intelligence I had to communicate to my unfortunate guest. At one moment I resolved in compassion to her situation to hide the truth from her; yet on reflection that appeared impossible. My next care was how to break it to her in the tenderest manner; I invited her to partake my repast, and soothed her by the kindest attention; yet by degrees hinted to her that all was not as it should be, that I feared her expectations would be greatly disappointed, that Rooksby was in trouble, and I would advise her at that time not to attempt to see him. “But if he is in affliction, madam, is it not my duty to fly to him, though he has forsaken me.”—“I fear, my dear, you would meet a shock, should you attempt to see him. He at present could not with propriety receive you.”—“Could not,—perhaps you think he would not?”—“I do not mean so. I never heard him mention you; but I know there are very forcible reasons against his receiving you; reasons which make it altogether impossible for you to be with him.—Yet do not be alarmed though Mr. Rooksby cannot I will be your friend. It seemed as at one moment she had comprehended the extent of her misfortune, for starting hastily from her seat she cried “Oh! I see it all, you, you madam, are not his sister, you are his wife, and I am undone forever!” To give a proper force to the scene during the rest of the evening would be impossible. I detained her with me and in the language of the purest simplicity, she told a tale that for a moment stole me from my own sorrow, to lament hers. I have requested her to commit it to writing that I might transmit it to you. She has complied and bid me tell you if she can save enough from the wreck of her little fortune to pay her entrance she will come and in your convent bury her shame and her misfortunes. Oh! my Celia, should she come, receive her with the kindness of a sister, and strive to alleviate the sorrows of her heart. She is innocent, unsuspecting, and full of sensibility. Comfort L 2 her then, and think in so doing you are chearing the heart of your MERIEL. P. S. I will continue my melancholy tale the next packet. At present neither my strength or spirits are equal to the task of writing more; besides my adored Clementina is far from well, and I have also with me Clara's two boys who, neglected at the school where they were left, had been very ill treated.—I have but little for myself, but while that little lasts, the grand-children of my revered Mrs. Rooksby, the relations of the sainted Margaret Kingly, shall share with my own child the morsel kind heaven bestows.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LIX. MERIEL to CELIA. December 29th, 1788. I resume my melancholy narrative, though God knows my heart bleeds at every vein, and the only consolation I have left, is, that you will pity—you will pray for me—my child—my beloved—my only comfort:—but Heaven's will be done. Array'd in robes of white, In yonder fields of light —She dwells in presence of the eternal king— Plac'd on a throne divine; Round which resplendent orbs of fire Forever glow—for ever shine! Hark! hark!—methinks I hear her sing, And with a rapt, a grateful soul, admire The verlasting joys that round her spring. She was sweet as the roses that bloom, And perfume the breath of the May, But, alas! to my sorrow as soon, She faded and withered away.— Bring me lilies that grow in the vale, And springs from the jessamine spray, They are sweet—tho' they're sickly and pale— She was fairer and sweeter than they. Her soul like the lily was pure, Like the Jessamine fair to the eye, Was her form—but, alas! when I tho't her secure, 'Twas decreed she should sicken and die!— And now in the cold—cold—grave she lies— No more she glads my heart, or chears my eyes. But I'll rise with the morn! To visit the turf That o'er the blest seraph is spread; Whilst I pluck from the earth Nettle, thistle or thorn! That unknowing her worth May, spring o'er her innocent head. For in her breast, no boist'rous passion dwelt— She never envy knew; or malice felt. But pure as angels—from this world she fled To yonder realms! so exquisitely fair— She sleeps—the cherub sleeps—she is not dead! She will awake to joys eternal there. And that we may all awake there, is my earnest prayer. Poor Clementina!—I laid her by the side of my dear mother. Oh, Celia! the one was not more innocent, more worthy a place in the mansions of the blest, than was the other:—I am poor! Celia—very poor!—there is no monument:— no, not even a stone, to tell where their beloved ashes repose—but sacred be the dust that covers them! They who knew their worth, will revere the spot where they rest—and none who love their memories, as I do, will pass it without a tear!— I took up my pen to write: I know not why—for I have nothing to say—only that this is a sad—very sad world to live in.— For if we love any thing we are sure to lose it. God forgive me, I often complain, when I have no right to do so—for we were all born to suffer.—Oh! my dear Celia, I wish you more patience than I have: for I am very impatient—sadly impatient:— but then indeed I am very—very— wretched!—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LX. FREDERIC KINGLY, ESQ. to COL. ONSLOW. London, Jan. 20th, 1789. I arrived in England, dear Onslow, just in time to administer relief to the most amiable, most lovely of her sex. When I went to visit my dear boys, I enquired when they had seen Mrs. Rooksby. They told me that for some time past they had neither seen or heard from her. I then repaired to Le Sage, who I knew was Rooksby's banker. From him I learned that Rooksby was in prison, and the dear worthy Meriel in distress for even the common necessaries of life. Her child, her beloved Clementina had been ill with the measles, and was even then in the utmost danger from a disorder which had settled on her lungs. I hastened to seek her out, and found her, Onslow, in a small lodging up three pair of stairs, in the vicinity of the King's bench prison, where her unworthy husband was confined. When I entered the room, she was kneeling by the bed-side, her face, her hands, elevated towards that Heaven whose mercy she supplicated in behalf of her dying child. Beside her knelt two lovely interesting boys, whom I afterwards learned were the children Rooksby had by Clara. I spoke to her. She took but little notice of me, for the feelings of a mother had absorbed every other. She signed for me to sit down, and pointing to her daughter looked unutterable anguish. I enquired whether she had proper advice and assistance; her answer cut me to the heart. She had not the means to procure proper medical advice!—Every thing of value had been disposed of to support her husband.—I did not remain long with this dear suffering angel!—But sent a Physician and a nurse to her, telling the latter, I would defray every expence—for will you believe it, Onslow, the dear creature, though reduced to the utmost distress, had never availed herself of the letter of credit I sent her previous to my departure from England. On the third day after this arrangement, I called to enquire how she was and found her sweet little girl had just breathed her last. That was not a time to offer consolation. I took the two boys from her, and gave orders for the funeral. She had a very decent woman with her, whom she called Deborah, and who I saw was both respectful and affectionate in her behaviour. I thought my company at that time might be more intrusive than welcome; besides I was sensible the world was ever ready to censure an unhappy woman, who in distress met with friendship, however disinterested from our sex. I therefore determined to wait till the funeral was over, before I attempted to see my dear afflicted Meriel; but on the very evening that the child was buried, I received a message from Deborah, saying her mistress was extremely ill, and she wished I would come to her immediately. I had been told that my adored girl had once before from the effect of a very heavy affliction, lost her senses for some days—(though what that affliction was, I never learned.)—But from this intelligence, I was prepared to find the same misfortune had befallen her. I was not deceived. She was writing when I entered the room, to a Miss Shelburne, with whom she spent the early part of her life in a convent at Bologne, such a letter, Onslow, as would melt the most obdurate heart. I waited till she voluntarily resigned her pen, which she soon did, when folding her letter and speaking to me, as though I was her servant she hade me make haste with it to the Post or I should be too late. It was by stratagem I got her to accompany me home, where I provided medical and other assistance. Deborah has faithfully attended her, and I am told she is now in a fair way of recovery, though her senses are still wandering.— During her confinement I have taken care that Rooksby should want for nothing; because I believe it is the first wish of the dear creature's heart. But I cannot bring myself to see or converse with a man, who has reduced so noble a mind as Meriel Howard's to insanity; for sure I am, her mental faculties must have been greatly weakened by prior afflictions or she would not so powerfully have felt the loss of her child. Her pious soul, if in the unimpaired use of her reason, would have severely felt the privation but still submitted with patience.— Deborah sends for me. May it be good tidings from her, who is all in all to me, and who though the wife of another, possesses my tenderest affection. Blame me not, my right was prior to his, and believe me my affection is pure as the soul of her who inspires it. She is restored to reason, thanks be to heaven for it, I have not yet seen her, nor does she know in whose house she is; but I VOL. IV. F am all joy at the fair prospect of her returning health. Tell your lovely amiable wife that every exertion necessary for the restoration of her friend shall be used, and that I hope my next letter will inform you of her perfect recovery. God bless you. May I see my dear Meriel in health before I am ordered again to leave England and I shall go without regret. Adieu, Yours in friendship, F. KINGLY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LXI. MERIEL to CELIA. London, March 16th, 1789. Once more snatched from death, or what is to a thinking mind far worse, a total deprivation of reason; I have next to an almighty providence, to render thanks and bless the hand of Kingly. Why am I doomed to be thus obliged, where I have no power to return the obligation but by grateful prayers and tears; I have some faint recollection of having wrote you a letter after the death of my beloved Clementina; but I fear it was very incoherent and hardly intelligible; but I will now endeavour to go back to the period when the poor young creature whom my husband had so vilely deceived came to my house at Pimlico. I resolved to prevent her, if possible, from seeing Rooksby, as I knew it would only irritate his sufferings, without in the least alleviating her own; I therefore prevailed on her to remain with me till I could form some plan that might be of use to her; and as I every day expected Kingly in England, I thought he might render himself of service to her, without subjecting her to the unjust censures, which would be cast on me should I accept favours from his hands. My time passed wretched enough for three weeks. At the end of that time I perceived that Harriet, which was the name of my Protegéé appeared somewhat more chearful and on enquiring the cause, she informed me that she was certain she had seen her mother's brother pass our house frequently, that she had inquired his name and learned it was the same she had thought it to be, that he lived in the neighbourhood and was a wealthy widower without children. From this information Harriet had conceived the idea of writing to him and faithfully explaining her unhappy circumstances. She shewed me the copy of a letter she had prepared, which as it contained the chief events of her life, I requested leave to send to you. I inclose it, and as it is necessary you should read it before I proceed I shall here break off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LXII. [INCLOSED IN THE FOREGOING.] HARRIET VENABLES TO GEORGE PREVOTT, ESQ. December 24th, 1788. Perhaps, my dear and honoured uncle will be both surprized and offended to receive a letter from one whom no doubt he has heard, conducted herself in a manner that has thrown an odium on her family, I have been to blame, greatly to blame, but not so very culpable as you and perhaps all the world imagine. I am fully sensible of the many disadvantages I labour under, while addressing you, yet when I remember that out of a numerous family you were the only one, who shewed a friendship for my poor mother when her union with my father so highly offended all. When I recollect the many instances of your affection I have myself witnessed when I was but a child, I cannot but hope you will not turn away from the daughter of that once loved sister.—Oh! why was I so early deprived F 2 of her maternal affection, or why did not the same stroke that snatched her from the world take also her unhappy daughter; for surely of all the forlorn beings the world contains a girl deprived of her mother is the most pitiable. She may, it is true, meet with relations or friends that will in some measure supply her place, but alas! they will not have the watchful care, the fond solicitude of a mother. Had I never lost that dear parent I should not have been the unfortunate creature I am; for there is a fort of talismanic virtue in the very name of mother, that while it fills our hearts with sensations undescribably delightful, is tempered with such awe, such fear of giving pain or incurring displeasure, that it must be a very insensible daughter who would wilfully do either. My dear father was the tenderest, the fondest of parents, and strained, to the utmost, his little income, to procure for me an education besitting a gentlewoman. He placed me as a boarder in a convent near Abbeville, his place of residence, that he might keep a watchful eye upon my conduct; for the honour of his family and that of my mother's were ever dear to his heart, and he often said that he would sooner see me in my coffin, whilst a child, than have me live to fully the name I bore and the family I sprung from. My life passed in uninterrupted tranquillity, 'till I was seventeen, at which period a Mademoiselle St. Farr was going to leave the convent and marry. She had ever conceived a great esteem for me, was five years older than myself and had resided in the convent from the death of her father, which happened when she was very young. She was a woman of an enlightened understanding, lovely in her person and elegant in her manners. She ever preserved that dignity, which renders our sex respectable, yet mixed it with such charming vivacity, such sprightly wit and unaffected good humour that she at once commanded respect and conciliated affection. I have been thus minute in my description of Mademoiselle St. Farr, that you might not be surprised at my father's ready compliance with a request she made, that I should accompany her to Brussels, and remain with her during the winter season. Young and volatile my heart bounded at the prospect of the liberty and pleasure I hoped to enjoy under her protection. Her husband Monsieur Melville was a gallant man, and from the day of their marriage, promoted every entertainment that he imagined could give pleasure to a young beautiful woman, just emerged from the gloom of a convent. But Madame Melville was a woman of too much discernment to suffer dissipation and folly to have a moments ascendency over her mind. After sharing in the amusements of Brussels a few weeks, she expressed a wish of living in a more domestic manner, and retired to an elegant chatheaux, which her husband possessed on the banks of the Seine. Thither I accompanied her: but, alas! sir, my weak mind had been fascinated with the pleasures of the gay world, and I had lost all taste for retirement, and rational society. The account in some measure for this change I must candidly inform you, that during my stay at Brussels I had formed an acquaintance with an English gentleman of the name of Rooksby.— He was a man of fortune, lived in an expensive stile, and (I blush while I own it,) at that very time lived publicly with a woman of an abandoned character. But, he had paid me numberless attentions and a profusion of compliments, so fascinating to the inxeperienced female heart, that I fancied, (fatal mistake!) had he an affectionate wife, whom he loved; she might reclaim him from the follies of which he seemed so fond. He had often professed a passion for me, but not openly, and there my errors commenced; for at his request I forbore to mention his pretensions to Monsieur or Madame Melville. That lady soon discovered the alteration in my spirits, after my leaving Brussels, and inquired into the cause. I evaded her kind questions: and soon after her brother coming to their chatheaux on a visit brought Rooksby with him. My chagrin vanished; I was again chearful and happy. A change so visible could not escape Madame Melville's penetration; she imagined it might be the attractions of her brother (who was in every respect her counterpart) which had made an impression on my heart. With a smile she entreated my confidence; but by the unembarrassed air with which I answered her interrogations she discovered her error. The smile was changed to a look of apprehension. “I hope Harriet, said she, you have not listened to any flighty tales from that young Englishman. I do not like his character. My brother brought him here from a motive of friendship to endeavour to detach him from a set of gamblers, who in combination with a very vile woman, are leading him blindfold to ruin. He is a very weak young man, and possesses no stability.” After this conversation she kept a very strict eye upon me, and soon discovered enough to make her think it necessary to send me back to the convent sooner than she at first intended. Rooksby followed me—I had not attempted to conceal from him the sentiments he had inspired me with. We found means to correspond: he laid a plan for my escape from the convent, I followed his pernicious councils, and we were privately married; but under a strict injunction never to divulge our marriage till he should give me leave. Imagining that obedience to him was now become my first duty, I took a most solemn oath, never to reveal our union, though by so doing, I could avert the heaviest misfortune. Gracious Heaven! how little did I suspect the dreadful calamity, which then hovered over my head? Happy as I was, in having, as I then thought, secured him to myself, I still felt a considerable alloy from the reflection that I had acted undutifully to my dear father; that I planted a dagger in his heart, perhaps incurred his heaviest malediction, yet dared not sue to him for pardon. Another source of disquiet was, that whenever Mr. Rooksby was absent for any length of time, I suspected he was with Clara the woman he had so publicly kept. To divert the melancholy, these fears occasioned, he proposed going for a few weeks to Paris, and thither I accompanied him. I had been there but ten days when one night, as I was at the opera, dressed in the gayest stile and in company with a woman to whom he had introduced me. Just as the performance began, I saw Madame Melville enter a box opposite to me, led by a gentleman whose face was from me. Judge, my dear sir, if possible, my emotions, when he turned round to seat himself, I discovered my father. His pale dejected countenance struck me with horror, an involuntary shriek escaped me, he raised his eyes, he saw!—he know me!—“Great God!” said he, clasping his hands, and sunk from the seat in a state of insensibility. What my feelings were at that moment, I will not, I cannot pretend to describe; nor can I tell how I got round from the box where I sat to the one that contained my father. All was confusion; but the distraction of my brain prevented my attending to any thing, but my parent, whom I saw before me to all appearance dead!—And, alas! bitter reflection, murdered by my ingratitude and disobedience!— When he began to recover, madame Melville hurried him out of the house, and I followed them almost unknowingly into the carriage. My father suffered me to hold his hands in mine, but did not speak to me during the time we were going to Madame Melville house. When we alighted, I percieved he trembled so he could scarcely stand. I followed him into a parlour, where he sunk upon a sopha. I fell on my knees before him. Forgive me, father, dear father, forgive me.” “Harriet,” said he, “what am I to think from your appearance.—tell me, tell me instantly and without prevarication.—Are you married?” “Do not ask me, I cannot answer.”— “Enough,” said he, “I understand my dishonour.”—Oh! my father, will you not pronounce my pardon? “Yes,” said he feebly, “may heaven eternally bless you and forgive you as I do now.” When I heard of your departure from the Convent it was like a bolt of ice shot through my heart. Oh! child, I have not had a moments peace since; but, if my pardon can give you comfort, from my soul I pardon you—But you are dishonoured. Oh! my child, how have you forgot what was due— He was proceeding; but his voice faultered and his head sunk on my shoulder, I thought it was a return of his faintness, and shrieked for help. Alas! how shall I proceed. The horrors of that moment will never be blotted from my memory. We raised and laid him on the sopha, we strove to revive him; but in vain. His noble soul had never known dishonour, and the springs of life before exhausted by sickness and many afflictions gave way at once under the pressure of a calamity he was not prepared to bear. Oh! sir, when I reflect on that night, when I remembered it was my folly, viper that I was, that stung him to the heart, my brain turns round, and only that he forgave me, with his parting breath, the very idea would deprive me of reason. Madame Melville suffered me to remain at her house till the last duties ware paid to his beloved remains; but as my character was now become equivocal, she forbore ever after to shew me any countenance. I sincerely lamented the privation of her friendship, and the more as I found it was an example that was followed by every woman of character with whom she was acquainted. My situation on that account became extremely painful, and I mentioned to Mr. Rooksby, my desire of returning to Abbeville, to take possession of the small patrimony my father had left me. He acquiesced, and we set forward immediately. vol. iv. G Three months, three little months, passed on in tranquillity, when my husband informed me he had particular business which called him to Brussels, that it would be impossible for him to return, and he thought it most expedient to sell off what furniture, &amp;c. we possessed, and to settle at that place.— Alas! my dear sir, fond of his society, and having no will but his, I hesitated not to comply. At Brussels, a new scene presented itself; a scene which gave me a pain, impossible to describe! and which no one but a wife who loved as I did can possibly conceive.— Mr. Rooksby renewed his connection with a set of gamblers and swindlers, who live on the follies of the unwary.—He became their dupe and in a few months was a very beggar.—It was one hot afternoon, in the middle of August last, when overcome by the weight of the atmosphere, and oppressed by my own reflections, I had retired to an arbour, which terminated the small space of garden belonging to the house we occupied, and was endeavouring to divert my sorrow, by the perusal of an English novel, which had been recommended to my notice. I was deeply interested in the sorrows of the “Welsh Heiress,” (who never having known the pleasures of maternal ten derness, felt her heart expand towards those whose affection supplied the place of a mother.) My mind was occupied, my heart softened, the tears stole from my eyes, but they were tears that flowed from a source so pleasing, I wished not to stop their course: for while sympathy for poor Anna's distresses awakened my sensibility, I felt the most exquisite delight in the remembrance that there was an author, a female author[3] [3] Mrs. Bennett, author of Juvenile Indiscretions, &amp;c. , who in conjunction with a Burney and Lee would snatch the British novel from oblivion, and future ages should with pleasure peruse the productions of her pen. Pardon me, sir, but with such fervour do I revere those superlatively happy few, who to a brilliant cultivated understanding, add a fertile natural genius, an elegant refined taste, and great sensibility, all other subjects are forgotten, and I am like a rapt enthusiast, all wonder and veneration. But to return to myself, I was employed in the perusal of the Welsh Heiress, when Rooksby with a hurried step and embarrassed air entered the arbour: he sat down beside me, struck his hand against his forehead, and breathed a sigh that seemed to come from his heart. My dear uncle must have a bad opinion of my heart, if he thinks fictitious distress could longer engross my thoughts, and though he had been from me then above a fortnight, yet as I knew he was my husband—I also knew it was my duty to receive him on his return with a smile, and, if possible, alleviate the afflictions which seemed to oppress him. I threw aside my book and taking his hand inquired the cause of this visible dejection. He told me he was ruined past redemption, that he had even lost more than he possessed the means to pay.—Unexperienced, my heart overflowing with affection, I endeavoured to sooth his sorrows; and to calm the immediate perturbation of his mind, I put into his hands almost the whole of my worldly possessions: for I thought the most abject poverty preferable to seeing him labour under such dejection of spirits. He left me soon after and I, visionary like, amused myself with the hope of seeing him return (after he had paid his debts of honour) a true penitent, and that some little might be left from the wreck of his fortune, on which we might live in decent competence retired from the world, and yet enjoy all the real blessings of life. But, alas! sir, these pleasing, delusive hopes lasted but a short time. Night advanced, and Rooksby did not return! Day after day passed, and I saw him not! I sent to inquire after him—he was still with his dissolute companions!—A fortnight passed in the horrors of the most torturing suspense—at the expiration of which, the following inchorent scrawl was put into my hand. HARRIET—I am lost.—I have killed a man—I am wounded myself, yet flying from the hand of justice.—I am a wretch, a very wretch! and what is still worse, dear injured Harriet, I am a villain!!!— Forget me—for you will never see me more.— ROOKSBY. I know I deserve it, yet do not, dear Harriet, do not, curse me. The perusal of this horrid billet threw me into a state of insensibility, and when I recovered the power of thinking, it was too late My husband was set off for England. I would have followed; but a fever occasioned by the agitation of my spirits, consined me to my bed. Long and doubly tedious G 2 were the hours of sickness, as they prevented my following and even in prison attending him. The anxiety of mind retarded my recovery, and I selt myself much hurt and neglected at receiving no tidings from Mr. Rooksby. At one moment, I thought him dead! at another, languishing on a bed of sickness. At length, I heard by accident, that he was recovered from the consequence of his wound, and this intellgence in some measure relieving my anxiety, I began to regain my health, and when I was able set forward for England. On my arrival in London, I went to a Mr. Le Sage, whom I had often heard Mr. Rooksby mention was his banker. By him I was directed to Pimlico.—But, Oh! my dear sir— I cannot proceed.—I am not his wife!— There is another a—prior claim to mine!— He has a wife—angelic creature! I am now under her protection. She has held forth to me the hand of benevolence—though, much I fear, she has scarcely the means to support herself, as she told me the other day that she must leave the house she was then in, and discharge her servants, as her income would afford nothing but the necessaries of life; yet added she, with a smile of friendly attention, small as my power is, you shall be welcome to share with me the little I have left. Oh! my dear uncle, let me intreat you to extend your kindness towards me. All I request is means to return to France, and spend the remainder of my days as a pensioner in a convent, where by a constant course of penitence and prayer I may in some measure atone for my offences.—One thing more. I hardly know how to write it; but —a few months will make me a mother. Should this unfortunate child of affliction prove a girl; with me shall the be buried in the shades of obscurity: if a boy to your care I must commit him, for alas! I have no means to support him, and may you, dear sir, teach him to avoid the vices of his father, and whenever he sees a wretched forsaken woman, to pity and endeavour to comfort her, in remembrance of the sorrows of his mother.—In hopes of your pardon and protection, I beg leave to stile myself your Dutiful Niece. HARRIET VENABLES.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MERIEL, IN CONTINUATION. It was not long after this letter was dispatched before Mr. Prevott came and personally offered to Harriet an asylum in his house. Their meeting was tender I shared her joys as far as my own unhappy situation would permit, but cordial as was the offered friendship of her uncle I could perceive he felt, severely felt, poor Harriet's dishonour. I was greatly relieved by her having found so able, so proper a protector; for indeed, my dear Celia, I was reduced very low, and two days after she left me I removed from the house at Pimlico and which we had taken ready furnished. I discharged my servant and would have persuaded good Deborah to return to Wales to her friends, offering to pay her expenses home. But this was attempting an impossibility. She told me I might send her from my presence; but no power should force her from London. She would remain near me, nay, she would serve me while she had life. Such a proof of disinterested sidelity awakened all my gratitude, and from that moment I took her for my companion, my friend, my adviser, and we removed together to a small lodging near the King's bench prison, where poor Rooksby was by this time removed; for his distresses were so complicated and his affairs in such a distracted state it was impossible to procure his enlargement. Here it was I first began my letter to you, in which I meant to have included the whole account of my sad change, but my dear girl sickened with the measles, and after languishing near a month was taken to eternal bliss. I fear, my beloved Celia, I behaved in a manner unbecoming a Christian, I did not submit as I ought I gave way to despair and was punished by the loss of reason, for several weeks. In this situation Kingly once morestepped forward to preserve and rescue me from the horrors of a mad house; for to that dreadful state, or perhaps worse to that of a poor wandering lunatic destitute and forlorn, I might have been reduced but for his timely interposition. He had me removed to his own lodgings, attended by the best Physicians, nay, he even extended his benevolence to my unfortunate husband, whose feelings had been strongly awakened by the death of his child. But those feelings were soon overcome, and his heart again become calous. When I first began to recover my recollection, it was carefully concealed from me where I was. Deborah by degrees informed me of all that had passed and told me Kingly requested to see me. I was too weak in mind and body to resist, and for some time I was accustomed to pass an hour or two with him every day, I saw not the danger, the impropriety of my situation, till roused from my dream of security by the following circumstance. I was well enough to leave my apartment for the adjoining room, where I had dined for the first time with Kingly, who, as he said, to surprize me agreeably had sent for his dear boys from school, and also Clara's two children, whom he has taken under his protection. At the first sight of the children my sorrows all revived and I gave wayto a violent burst of tears, which relieved the oppression that seemed like a cord to be bound round my heart. I wept plentifully, nor did any one attempt to prevent me. The dear children had all by degrees drawn nearer to me, and the youngest boy climbing on my lap, wiped off my tears with his frock, whilst he kissed me and bade me not cry any more. I know not how it was; but the anguish of my heart gradually subsided. I am not destitute of comfort said I mentally; these dear children, the friendship of Kingly, is something yet! how many at this moment, a thousand times more deserving, are more wretched, more forlorn than I am. During dinner these reflections occupied my mind. I spoke little, but I felt a degree of serenity pervade my breast, to which it had long been a stranger. When the desert was removed, the boys growing rather boisterous in their play were dismissed to another apartment. Kingly seated himself next me. We were for some moments silent. “I hope,” said Kingly, “my dear Mrs. Rooksby, you will now soon be able to reap the benefit of fresh air, and go for a short time into the country. It will be of great service to you.” “I hope I shall,” replied I, “soon be able to go out; for then I can go to poor Rooksby, for I wish to see him and learn how he is accommodated; I fear he has been very uncomfortable during my illness.”—“Surely my dear creature,” said he, fixing his eyes on my face with a look of expressive tenderness, “surely you cannot mean to return to that man.” “Why not, Mr. Kingly. He certainly wants a friend and comforter under his present uneasy circumstances.”— “But are not his present calamities the fruit of his own folly; and has he not behaved in the basest manner to you? has he not forfeited all right— “Not to my duty and attention,” said I, eagerly interrupting him, “if he has forgot his duty, it is no rule for me to neglect mine.” “But should you leave him, all the world would acquit you.” “Yes Kingly; but I must be acquitted by a higher, a more sacred tribunal than the world. I seek the approbation of my own conscience, and the continued protection of a Being; wise! as he is great and merciful.”— “But surely, my dear Meriel, as you have done your duty, nothing more can be expected from you.” “Yes Kingly, yes while I live, and Rooksby is in existence I know my marriage vow is in full force; and may I soon be able to fulfill the sacred engagements I entered into.” “Oh! Meriel you surely love, spite of his errors this ungrateful Rooksby.” “No—no,—mistake me not, I mean not to arrogate to myself the merit of a virtue to which I have no claim. I pity him from my soul, nay would sacrifice my own peace; to restore his tranquillity; but did I love him; Oh! gracious heaven, did I love him, I could not live and retain my reason under my present circumstances.” “Then, why Meriel, why will you sacrifice your own peace, to a chimerical notion of duty? If you love him not, why return to him: why fly from a man, who not only loves, but almost adores you? Then stay with me, thou beloved of my soul, share my fortune and be the friend of my bosom; Rooksby shall enjoy all the comforts, nay if you require it, all the elegancies of life.” Shall I tell you, my friend, shall I confess that strong as was my sense of rectitude, I felt my resolution slacken. My treacherous heart even debated whether I should not stand excused, if I accepted his offer.—Oh, God! pardon the weakness of frail humanity, if for a moment, I forgot what was due to the Deity I served—the religion I professed. Yes, Celia, I listened, I thought myself convinced, and had consented to leave the man to whom I had promised love and obedience to the latest period of our lives. vol. iv. H Kingly, though ardent in his wishes for me to be seperated from my husband, was respectful in his behaviour and we passed the evening in a friendly conversation, which would not have called a blush on the cheek of a brother and sister. Deborah had during my illness always. slept in my apartment. But a few nights preceding the one I have mentioned, we had prevailed on her to go to another room and suffer one of Kingly's servants to occupy her place on a mattress by my bed-side. When I was retired to rest, when I no longer saw the expressive countenance, or heard the persuasive tongue of Kingly, reflection returned with double force, and I perceived I was standing on the brink of a precipice, from which if I receded not in time, I must plunge into everlasting ruin. Weak as I still was from the effects of my disorder, I resolved to fly, while I had sufficient reason left to direct me from the dangerous temptations which surrounded me.—Forsaken, injured by my husband, and under the immediate protection of the man, who first taught my heart to beat with affection, who had conferred on me obligations I could never repay, who still loved:—And, Oh! my dear Celia, (the glow of confusion covers me as I write it,) who still was beloved by me. To deliberate a moment; was to be lost, another such an interview as the last, and I might rush on irretrievable destruction. The servant who slept in the room with me, wearied by the employments of the day enjoyed a sound and undisturbed repose.— The clock had struck three, when convinced of the danger of remaining longer under his roof, I resolved to fly from Kingly. A candle was always burning in my room: I arose with as little noise as possible, wrapping myself as warm as I could and tying up a change of linen in a handkerchief, I glided softly down stairs, and opening the street door ventured into the street. I knew there were coaches employed in the night as well as the day, and did not fear but I should soon find one to convey me to the house where I had lodged, previous to the death of my ever regretted Clementina, and where I knew I should be received and might remain till the hour when I could be admitted into the prison to my husband. You will, perhaps, blame me, for leaving the protection of Kingly, in so abrupt a manner. Perhaps you will say why not stay till the morning, and then inform him of my resolution.—Alas! my friend, I dared not stay. I was sensible of the weakness of my heart, and had he intreated! had he looked unhappy! I know it would not have been in my power to persevere. His lodgings were in Westminster near the park, and I found no stand of coaches near. Add to this, my weakness and the penetrating keenness of the night air, made my head swim, and I staggered like a person intoxicated. I was proceeding as well as I was able toward Westminster bridge, when a cry of thieves and a watchman's rattle arrested my attention. I was then near the end of Parliament-street, and before I had time for a moments thought found myself surrounded by a number of watchmen, constables and other strange looking people, who one and all, persisted that I was an accomplice with a gang of thieves, who had, by the assistance of the housekeper, broke in and robbed a lady's house in Georgestreet. I attempted to speak; but had not the power. A cold chillness seized me, and my limbs failed, though I still retained my senses and felt the horrors of my situation in their full force!—Imagine, my dear Celia, for a moment what my feelings were. I feared my reason would again wander: but it pleased Heaven to preserve me from that dreadful calamity. They conveyed me without resistance to the watch-house, where they threw me like a beast upon the floor, imagining my inanimation to proceed from the effects of liquor. Though unable to speak, I groaned pitiously and felt the tears gush in torrents from my eyes: but still I was unnoticed by all, except a young creature who I am sure could not have counted above sixteen years, and who habited in a white bedgown, a tattered silk petticoat, and a pair of old sattin shoes that would scarcely save her feet from the ground, sat in a corner of the place near where they had thrown me down; and as I then verily believed, where I was to end my days. For the sudden shock that had deprived me of the power of speech and motion seemed like the stroke of death, and I listed up my soul to that Power who I thought was calling me to himself from a world, where from a child, I had experienced little else but sorrow. The poor girl, whom I heard them call Peggy, knelt down beside me raised my head on her knee and put a small glass of warm punch to my mouth, which the constable had just given her.—“Let her alone H 2 Peggy, said he, she has had enough already. She is so drunk she can neither speak nor stand.— “Poor soul,” cried Peggy, in an accent of the softest compassion. “She is ill I can see she is, and may die for want of assistance. Come, continued she, swallow a drop of this. It may revive you.” Celia, the love of life is so strongly impressed on human nature, that though bending beneath the weight of almost insupportable afflictions we struggle still to preserve existence. I swallowed the offered refreshment, Peggy chaffed my hands and laid my head upon her bosom; my spirits revived, my strength began to return and in less than half an hour I could articulate my thanks to my preserver. Till ten the ensuing morning I remained in this miserable place, nor was I even able to procure the least accommodation for myself or companion in sorrow; for they had not only taken my bundle from me but even risled my pockets of a guinea and a half, which was all that I possessed in the world. At ten o'clock a coach was called and with several others I was carried to a justice's for examination; for it was alledged that I was the woman, who had opened the door to the thieves and that having got what booty I could myself, I was making off when they stopped me; in evidence of which they produced my little bundle which contained two shifts a petticoat two muslin handkerchiefs and a linen gown. The constable also swore that I had more property about me; but that I had thrown it away when they pursued me and they could find nothing but a gold watch chain which they had picked up, and which they immediately produced wrapped in a fine cambrick handkerchief. Judge my surprize, Celia, when on opening the handkerchief I saw my own watch chain, to which was fixed a miniature of my departed child set round with pearls, and on which I had desired Deborah to raise some money, I imagine the faithful creature had deceived me and raised the money on something of her own—yet how the chain could be dropped by me was a mystery, unless as I have since reason to think it was with the gown I had packed up and might drop from the bundle. During my examination, a coach stopped at the door and an elderly lady entered. It was the lady, whose house had been attempted. The moment she saw me she pronounced me not guilty. I never saw her before, said she, with visible emotion, and even had she lived in my house. I could not have suspected her.— I cannot, my dear Celia, describe this lady to you such as she appeared to me. There was a mixture of majesty and condescension in her manner, her countenance beamed benignity, and it appeared a countenance rendered grave by affliction rather than that by nature. Several other persons were now brought in, who had been apprehended by other watchmen, and from a variety of evidences I was acquitted; when I heard those words pass the justice's lips, I was hastily leaving the place, but a man stopped me and told me I could not go till I had paid all fees.—“Indeed sir,” said I, in a voice scarcely audible, “I have no money; that watch chain I think was mine, yet how it came here I know not nor dare I demand it. Permit me to go and if ever it is in my power”—“I shall do no such thing, mistress,” said the man, “either pay the fees or stay in our custody till you can.” I could not answer, but raising my hands and eyes to heaven was returning in silent agony when the lady advanced and inquired the cause of my new distress. “And are these your British laws” said she, “that when a person is falsely accused and their innocence made perfectly appear, are they to be detained from their families for the paltry consideration of a few shillings?” She then put her hand in her pocket and presented me with two guineas, at the same time asking if she could be of any further service to me; I would have thanked her, but my feelings were too powerful to permit me to speak, she saw my gratitude, she perfectly comprehended from my looks more than words would convey.—“You interest me,” said she, “can you not tell me how I may serve you. Oblige me, madam; make me your friend I will not abuse your confidence; but pardon me, I am to blame. This is no place for conversation. Do me the favour to wait till I have finished the disagreeable business that brought me here, and then give me leave to take you to any place you wish to go to in my carriage.”—I curtsyed my assent to this humane proposal, for indeed Celia, I was unable to walk, and could but ill afford to procure a coach. Harrassed as my spirits had been, my strength was exhausted and I was almost sinking with faintness. When the lady had ended her business, she desired me to follow her, just as we were stepping out of the door, poor Peggy who was just released, passed us on the steps.— “Forgive me, madam,” said I, “if I presume to share with this benevolent girl, the bounty of your hand. She did all in her power last night for me, I fear I should have perished, but for her humanity.”—I then gave her the remainder of the guinea I had changed to pay the fees of the office. “God bless you,” said she, pressing the hand that offered her the money, while the tears started in her fine blue eyes. “And was she kind to you?” said the lady. I repeated the circumstance of the preceding night. “Good girl,” said she, “have you any friends?” addressing Peggy. “Oh! no Madam,” I am a poor, guilty, forlorn creature: lost to every thing but a sense of my own misery.” “So young, and yet accuse yourself of guilt.” “Alas Madam, I was involved in guilt before I knew the value of virtue.” The lady answered not; but giving her a card, bade her call on her in the afternoon, and she would do something for her. “And now,” said she, as she seated herself in her carriage, “tell me where you wish to go.” “To the Kings bench prison, madam.” “To a prison, good heavens! have you friends there?” “My husband, madam, is confined there.” “Have you any children? “I had, madam, one, a sweet girl:— but”—I could not proceed. I turned my face from her, and we both remained silent for several minutes.— “I too,” said the lady, starting as it were from a deep reverie. “I too, once had a child—a girl—nay, perhaps have still; but for many! many! years, she has been lost to me.” When we drew near to the end of our little journey, she told me she felt inclined to be my friend, and if I would do her the favour to call at her house and point out the means, she would readily exert her utmost abilities to alleviate the afflictions, which seemed to press so heavily upon me. She then told me her name was Harcourt and wished me a good morning. Weak, oppressed, dejected my trembling limbs being scarce able to support me, I slowly ascended the stairs, which led to the apartment occupied by Rooksby. The door was opened. I was just entering, but a sight met my eyes that almost annihilated me. It was Rooksby seated beside his infamous Clara, with tea and coffee on the table before them. From their own dishabille and the appearance of the room, I perceived they were but just risen. I know not what I said in the first moment of surprize, but I remember clasping my forehead hard with both my hands and exclaiming, “grant me patience heaven.” As I ran down stairs, my brain seemed whirling in perpetual motion and had I not been detained by one of the keepers of the prison I fear I should have rushed into the street in a state little short of insanity. The recollection of what I then suffered is too much for my weak spirits. I cannot proceed in my narrative. Adieu, my friendly Celia, I am now in a place of safety and will, when I am able, inform you of every occurrence down to the present time. Heaven bless you. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LXII. FREDERIC KINGLY, ESQ. to COL. ONSLOW. March 7th, 1789. I hardly dare take up my pen to write to the worthy Onslow: for I have rendered myself totally unworty of his friendship. Will you and your amiable Amelia believe it? No you will think it impossible, that I—I, who so often have sworn to protect her, should act in so thoughtless a manner as to drive the lovely Meriel from my house. Yes, Onslow, she left my house in the night, unattended and rushed into dangers, of which her delicate mind could form no idea; and my folly was the cause. I forgot what was due to her honour and my own, and dared to solicit her to quit her husband and remain with me. Oh! fool, madman that I was, when I knew the dignity of her mind, to think she would suffer such a thought to harbour in her bosom for a moment. She once loved me;—yes, and I with a voice soft as harmony, yet with looks and manners chaste as Diana, has she lately confessed she still does and ever shall love me. But did I not know the heart of Meriel Howard. Was I not sensible, that with all her sexes softness she possessed the firmness and intrepidity of a Spartan matron? But I am tormenting you with suspense while I am writing an eulogium on her, with whose virtues you are already well acquainted. The dear creature had recovered so far as to be able to leave her apartment, when the conversation passed between us, which frightened her from the protection I had vainly hoped would have henceforth sheltered her from all the ills of life. She had supped with me, and on retiring, wished me a good night with a look and voice so full of tenderness, that I longed to press her to my heart: but I forbore and only kissed her hand. Early the next morning, I was awakened by poor Doborah, who asked me if I knew where her lady was—for she was not in her apartment, nor had the servant who slept in her room seen her. Terrified, least her unfortunate malady should have returned, I hastily arose and inquired of every person in the house if they had seen her; but to no purpose. The street door was found unlock'd and on searching her apartment her hat and cloak with a few necessaries were missing. It then rushed into my mind that her own sensibility and strict sense of rectitude had driven her from my protection. Where could she go? Her friends or rather those who had once stiled themelves so, had all forsaken her in her misfortunes—to whom then could she go? Distracting as the thought was, I concluded she was gone to her base treacherous husband. Impressed with this idea, I went immediately to the prison; but she had not been there. I did not attempt to see Rooksby, I could not have spoken to him with calmness. I returned home almost deprived of reason, nor had I any tidings of the dear fugitive, till late in the afternoon, when I received the following note. MRS. ROOKSBY. to F. KINGLY, ESQ. You are no doubt uneasy; let this calm your fears, I am safe. Reason told me I must not remain any longer with you. I came to my husband; but something has occurred, which I cannot now explain, and which makes it impossible for me to remain with him. We have parted, I believe, forever.—But I charge you, Kingly, endeavour not to find me out,—I wish not to see you again. It is meddling world. They have been already too busy with our names.—Think me not ungrateful for your friendship: it will never be obliterated from my mind while I have life; but it is fit, it is proper we should meet no more.— I know my faithful Deborah will wish to come to me. Bid her come with the bearer of this, who waits. But oh! Kingly, unless you wish to add another weight to my already insupportable afflictions, make no attempt to see me.—Heaven bless you, forever bless you, I cannot express all I wish; perhaps did I feel less, I could write with more eloquence.—As my last request I intreat you not to withdraw your bounty from the children of Clara. They are innocent, whatever are the crimes of their parents. Oh Kingly, if you could see my heart, you would see it bleed with real anguish, while I tell you we must not cannot meet again. Once more, God bless you, and reward you for your kindness to the wretched MERIEL. Though I earnestly desired to see the suffering angel, her commands, her pathetic entreaties to me were sacred; I sent for Deborah and giving her ten guineas bade her hasten to her mistress and to let me know when she wanted more cash. The faithful old woman sobbed with joy when I told her that her lady was safe; and left the room almost with the alacrity of a girl, when she was told to follow the messenger who brought the letter. The next morning, the money was returned in a small parcel, which I received and opened without knowing from whence it came. On the inner paper were these words. “Dear generous Kingly, I am already overwhelmed with obligations from you. Pardon me, I can receive no more.” There was no name annexed; but I knew the dear characters had been traced by the hand of Meriel.— Resolved, if possible, still to serve her, even against her inclination, I went to my agent and desired him to go to the bench, make inquiry for Deborah and pretend to pay some money that was owing to old Mr. Howard. But here I failed; for when my agent returned, he informed me that Mrs. Rooksby had been with her husband that she remained only a short time and where she was gone no one could tell. He also informed me I 2 that Rooksby had a woman in the apartment with him, who had been thrown into prison about three weeks before by a Mercer, to whom she was indebted upwards of a hundred pounds, and that both of them expected soon to be released. From his description of the woman's person, I should suppose it to be the infamous Clara; but think it almost impossible, as I was informed she was living at Brussels only a short time since in great splendor with a man of the first rank and fortune. Should it prove so, I shall pronounce him a blacker villain than I ever thought him: and how like an angel will the villainy of the one and the ingratitude of the other make Meriel appear, who in the very moment that she was so cruelly treated by them could recommend their children to my care. I will obey her, Onslow. They shall share the education of my own boys, and I make no doubt of being able to provide for them either in the army or navy.— Every inquiry after Meriel is vain. She has hid herself so effectually as to elude the strictest search; I can no longer stay in England I have solicited employment in the West Indies and shall soon sail. I have commissioned my agent to continue his search for Mrs. Rooksby and should he discover the place of her retreat to supply her with cash, without suffering her even to suspect from whom it comes. I am certain wherever she is, she is in necessity. Good heavens, that I should live to say, while I am in possession of all the superfluities of life, Meriel Howard, the first choice of my heart, the woman I love and revere above all her sex, is perhaps languishing for want of the means to support existence. I will write no more I am almost devoid of reason when I think for a moment on the subject. I hardly dare desire my remembrance to your Amelia. I know how she loved and esteemed Meriel, and I have some faint hope that she will hear from the dear sufferer's own hand how she has disposed of herself; for certain I am, that while life warms the heart of Meriel Howard, it will glow with grateful affection for Amelia Sidney. And while I live, I shall remain your's in friendship. F. KINGLY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LXIII. MERIEL to CELIA. May 20th, 1789. I broke off abruptly in my last, for I found my spirits were unequal to the task of retracing scenes which had given me so much uneasiness. I informed you of my discovery of Clara in the prison with Rooksby; but I am yet to inform you that when, by the humanity of one of the keepers, I was prevailed on to go into a room and endeavour to compose myself, I received a verbal message from my cruel tyrant, desiring me to leave him to his fate and return to my favourite Kingly, with whom he knew I had publicly lived for several weeks in defiance of shame. A message so injurious, so unjust, roused my resentment, and I demanded to see the cruel man, who could thus dare to insult me. I once more ascended the stairs to his apartment, and knocking at the door, entered with as much resolution, as I could assume. He received me with a mixture of confusion and contempt, and Clara, without deigning to rise from her seat; gave a slight inclination of the head: but at that moment I felt myself a wife, an innocent injured wife! and resentment conquered every other feeling!— “Rooksby!” said I, seating myself opposite to him, and regarding him with a fixed attention, “I come to inquire by what action of my life, I have incurred the unjust censures you have thrown upon me, or in what I have forfeited my claim to your regard, since I have been your wife.” “By your vile connection with Belger, before you were my wife—and your still more infamous intrigue with Kingly since!” said he, in a kind of hurried accent, as though conscious he did not himself believe what he asserted. “By all my hopes of future felicity, Rooksby,” I replied, “I am innocent of what you accuse me, as was the infant I bore— and who, I trust, is now an angel in the mansions of the blest!”—At the recollection of my child, tears, in spite of my efforts to suppress them, burst from my eyes.— Rooksby was affected. “Poor Clementina,” said he, rising and coming toward me, I should have liked to have seen her once more, before she was gone forever.” Clara, saw she was losing ground; so rising in great haste, she told him that when he had settled the difference that had been between us, perhaps, she might look in and congratulate us; that content was a great blessing, and a forgiving temper, a sure sign of a good christian; that for her part, she had good reason to suppose both Mrs. Belger and Mrs. Kingly fell victims to my art, for their hearts were broken by their husbands, whose affections I had exerted myself to obtain, and had effectually drawn from them.” “If,” said I with more firmness than I believed myself capable of, “if every woman in the world was as free from the crime of seducing the affection of a husband from his wife as I am, it would be well for many. But, be not mistaken, Clara, I come not to sue to my husband, or endeavour to regain his heart, I am at length convinced I never possessed it, and as it would have been happy for us, had we never met; I am determined that we will here part forever!!!” “Forever, Meriel,” said Rooksby, “leave me forever?”— Clara's countenance brightened, and she resumed her seat. “I am well convinced, Rooksby,” I replied, “that so far from having it in my power to serve or oblige you, my presence is painful to you, and I am considered a burthen.—The pain, the burthen shall therefore be removed.” “And you will return to Kingly?” “No! Rooksby.—Here in the awful face of Heaven, I swear, I never have, nor ever will dishonour the name of your revered mother: a name, which at her request I received from you. And, that Heaven is my witness, was the chearful discharge of my duty a source of happiness to you, as no power on earth should seperate me from you!—I would remain with you in the most abject distress—comfort you— nay, even labour for your support! but— as it is—we must part!!!—I forgive you from my soul, every injury—not only you! but, those who have been the cause of your errors!—I will pray for your happiness—and forget, if possible—how cruelly and how often you have wronged me!”— “I am villain!” said he, rising and striking his forehead with vehemence. “Before we part Rooksby,” cried I, laying my hand on his arm, “I solemnly conjure you as the last and only request I shall ever make, seek not to palliate your own faults by taxing me with guilt. I am conscious of my own innocence, and feel not the sharpness of the accusation; but it increases your own offences in the sight of Heaven!—I forgive every thing that has past—only, throw not an odium on my character, and I will bless you forever!”— “You are, you must be innocent,” said he, “I believe you are pure as an angel. You are a treasure too great for me to possess. I have voluntarily thrown you from me, and though I know your worth, some strange fatality ever pursues me, and the weakness of my nature hurries me to actions which I know are wrong.” “Farewel!” said I, turning to leave the room. “But whither are you going, Meriel, I fear you are in want. My affairs begin to wear a better aspect. I have had a few thousands left me by a relation. Let me know where to send to you that you may share in my fortune, though I can never hope again to possess a place in your heart.—His voice faultered and he actually shed tears. Celia, Rooksby is a man so weak so unstable in his nature that the impulse of the moment ever hurries him away: and perhaps just then he would have sued for a reconciliation and had he been master of the world offered to divide it with me. And the first moment Clara had an opportunity to exert her art, she would have revived all his suspicions and I should again been ill treated, vilified, nay, perhaps thrust like an abandoned wretch from his house. Sensible of this versatility of temper I wished not to prolong our interview, besides I was faint and exhausted. The spirits which resentment had roused were now begining to subside and when I considered his errors and the weakness of his nature I only considered him as an object of compassion. The presence of Clara too was insupportably painful, I, vol. iv. K therefore, almost forcibly tore myself from him and hurring down stairs immediately left the prison, and went to the lodgings I had occupied before. The woman of the house received me kindly. After I had taken some refreshment I lay down and endeavoured to procure a little rest; but the effort was ineffectual.— The scenes I had been engaged in the preceding night and day entirely occupied my thoughts; the idea of Kingly's surprize and uneasiness when he should discover my having left him; the sorrow of my affectionate Deborah, my own forlorn situation, and dreary future prospect, all conspired to banish from my eyes the balmy comfort of sleep. I arose, and procuring pens and paper, wrote a few lines to my husband informing him where I was, that he might not say I had prevented his assisting me by not letting him know where to send. I also wrote to Kingly in a manner which I knew would effectually prevent his endeavouring to see me; but desired him to send Deborah back with the person, who brought the letter. I passed the night in a very restless manner, and in the morning was unable to rise. A fever, want of appetite, and great lassitude, hung upon me for above ten days.— Indeed, I thought I was going into a rapid dicline; but the care of Deborah, who nursed me with incessant tenderness, and parted even with some of her apparel to procure me proper and nourishing food, restored me to some degree of my wonted strength. During this time, I heard nothing from Rooksby: though perfectly satisfied, that his sickle disposition had operated as usual, and that no longer seen, I was no longer remembered, yet something prompted me to send to the bench and inquire after him. Deborah was my messenger; she returned and told me he had been released above a week. I then sent to Le Sage; but without letting him suspect who made the inquiry, and learned that my husband, (Oh, Heavens! happy had I been, had he never borne that title!) had left England in company with Clara; for I particularly desired the person who inquired, to ask, wherever he was, if he was alone. It was now time to think of some means of support, Gratitude also required that I should call on the benevolent Mrs. Harcourt. I dressed myself as neat as the scanty state of my wardrobe would allow and repaired to her house. At my approach, I saw the shutters of the upper part were closed; my heart sunk; but yet I ventured to knock at the door. A woman servant opened it. I inquired for Mrs. Harcourt. “She is at “Bath,” replied the woman. “Has she been ill then?”—“Yes, she caught cold on the night her house was robbed, which added to the fright, brought on the gout in her stomach. She was taken ill the next evening and for several days was thought in great danger; but she is now better, and yesterday morning set off for Bath.” I thanked the woman for her information and was going from the door, when who should I see cross the hall but Peggy. She saw and instantly recollected me: an exclamation of joy and surprize escaped her and she ran to the door to speak to me. She informed me that Mrs. Harcourt had taken her into the house as an assistant to the housekeeper that the kind lady had mentioned me previous to her departure, and desired if I called I would leave word where I might be found. I told Peggy I was not settled in any place at present; but I would call again in the course of a fortnight when I hoped to hear of Mrs Harcourt's perfect recovery. On my return, I consulted with Deborah, what we could possibly do to earn a subsistence. The affectionate creature could think of nothing. She could only weep that I was obliged to have recourse to work. After revolving many various schemes in my mind, I at length fixed on one, that I thought was seasible—It was to send Deborah to the woman, who had formerly supplied me with millinery, and to desire her to inquire in my name whether she could give employment to a reputable young woman, who was in an ill state of health and only able to work at her own apartment. Deborah executed the commission faithfully and on her return told me she had procured employment for me at a great warehouse, where she had been recommended by the person to whom I sent her. “But dear madam,” said she, the prices are so very small, you will never be able to live on what you earn.”—This did not deter me. I removed to a room near the warehouse for which I was to work; that our time might not be taken up in going backwards and forwards. Deborah procured the work and I executed it. I gave great satisfaction and had as much as myself and Deborah could possibly do, yet with the most indefatigable industry, we could scarcely earn eighteen or twenty shillings a week. The close application to my employment did not agree with my health, and I was obliged to devote an hour every day to exercise, nor did even this answer the desired end, and I was in a short K 2 time so pale and thin that you would scarcely have believed me to have been the Meriel Howard you once knew. Ill as I was, I still continued my employment as well as I was able; but weakness and fatigue often overcame me and I was obliged to give up hours to rest, and sometimes whole days. My weakness encreased, and my income proportionally decreased. I saw famine advancing with hasty strides, and to add to my affliction I knew the affection of Deborah had involved her in my distresses. My lodging was in Oxford-street, and I sometimes walked into the fields which are adjacent to the parish of Bloomsbury. One day, as with slow uneven pace I took my accustomed walk, just as I had reached Gowerstreet, I saw a splendid equipage pass me and stop at a house which seemed newly sitted up. I cannot account for the curiosity that seized me; but I inquired of a man who had the appearance of a Butler; to whom the house and carriage belonged. “To Mr. Howard” said the man—Mr. Howard; what Howard? “I don't know,” he replied, “what his Christian name is, but he is lately returned from India”.— Astonishment rendered me silent, and the man proceeded.— “He came over about two months since, and took that house. I then lived the next door and knew all that passed in the family. He brought a young lady over with him, who is very pretty; but seems unhappy. She is very young indeed; and he is going to marry her; but I think it is against her inclination: for though I have heard the servants say she seemed to respect him, she often declares she can never love him.— I mused upon what the man had told me and was determined to inquire farther about this Mr. Howard. It might be my brother, and the sums I had advanced it might now be in his power to return; not that I intended to ask him for them but, methought, natural affection would certainly operate in his bosom in behalf of a sister who had shared all her property with him and was now bent to the earth with sickness and sorrow.—On farther inquiry I learned that his name was Richard Howard. Determined to make at least a trial of him, I learned at what hour it would be most likely to see him, for as he was become a great man, I readily conceived my only being his sister and in distress would but poorly plead my excuse for going at an unseasonable time. Far be it from me, my dear Celia, to say this is the case with all, there are some glorious ornaments of the creation who never turn from the cry of affliction, and who never consider it intrusive; whose hearts are ever open and whose hands are ever ready to dispense to those who are in want, a part of those blessings which a bounteous Providence has showerd on themselves:—but the thorough knowledge I have of the human heart led me to reflect, that when a person has unexpectedly risen to opulence from obscurity, his feelings grow callous he forgets and totally neglects those branches of his family who, though perhaps they have been equally industrious with himself, have not been equally the favourites of fortune. At ten o'clock one morning, I knocked at Mr. Howard's door; and was requested by the servant to send up my name, I did so, adding that I had particular business with him. After waiting about ten minutes (for I suppose my dress had not prepossessed the man in my favour.) I was told I might come up.—My limbs trembled as I entered the room. The first glance convinced me it was my brother, though he is greatly increased in bulk, being now a very stout man, and when we parted he was but a slender lad, yet his features were the same. He was sitting at breakfast with a very young lady, who appeared dejected and unhappy. I imagined this to be the person of whom the servant spoke. He gave a slight inclination of the head as I entered, the servant brought forward a chair and left the room. “Now madam,” said the haughty master of the house, “what is your pleasure?” “Is it possible,” said I, looking earnestly at him, “that you can have no recollection of me?— “Not the least, I do not recollect that I ever saw you before.” “You had once a sister, sir.— “Yes I had, but she was always a strange eccentric girl; she ran through a very good fortune, and I understand has disgraced her family in the most shocking maner.” “Brother,” said I, emphatically, “and I felt my eyes gush out with tears.— He sat down the cup, which he was raising to his lips, and with a look of mingled anger and astonishment, cried, “why surely you can never be Meriel Howard.”— “I am your sister, I am all that remains of Meriel Howard, but I no longer bear that name.”— “I was told you had assumed the name of a gentleman with whom you lived some years, but he has left you through your own folly.”— “And who could assert such a falsehood, brother?”— “My Aunt Mossop told me, and so did Hester, who is well married. Susan wrote them word that you behaved in such a manner some few years since upon the continent, as occasioned the person you lived with to fight a duel on your account: that you seperated then and had never lived together since.” The flight, the cutting indifference of my brother, wounded me to the soul. I was debilitated in mind and body, yet I could hardly restrain the fulness of my heart; being unable to support the interview any longer, I arose to depart; for he had neither asked me to eat or drink. The young lady looked at me, and I saw the tear of compassion start in her eyes. “I am very sorry, Meriel,” said my brother, “that you are in such indifferent circumstances as your appearance seems to bespeak, if a couple of guineas” “No, sir!” said I, putting back the hand extended with the money, if I am unworthy to be received as your sister, I am unworthy of your assistance: besides, brother, I came in hopes to find an affectionate relative, a friend, whose heart would compassionate my sufferings. Disappointed in that—I am too proud to accept a donation from your bounty!”—“As you please, madam!” bowing coldly, “had you conducted yourself in a manner becoming my sister”— “Brother, had I come to your door in a splendid equipage, perhaps, you would not have inquired so strictly into my conduct. In that case even the errors of which I am now accused, would have been overlooked; but poverty is a fault the opulent can seldom pardon. I am happy, brother, to see the advancement of your fortune; but, should you ever experience a reverse, you will then discover, that those who now caress and flatter you, nay, even would creep into your favour by vilifying me, would be the first to turn from you; and blame you for misfortunes you could neither avoid nor avert!” “I see Meriel,” said he, “with a sneer, “you at least retain one striking trait in your character, you are as good a preacher as ever.” “I will take care to retain every trait,” I replied, “for which I have been respected. I have now lost the name of Howard, and can no longer disgrace it by my poverty; and I hope my affluent brother will never let that name be dishonoured by him.” I then bade him good morning, without being requested to renew my visit. I was now so accustomed to disappointment that I felt not this behaviour of my brother so severely as I should have done some few years since. Indeed, my dear friend, I think my heart grows hard and insensible, and seems turning into stone, for it is cold and inanimate. I can no longer exult in the happiness, or sympathize in the miseries of my fellow creatures. The world appears one universal blank, nay even when I think of you and my Amelia, it still beats but languidly, its emotions are no longer exquisitely pleasant or painful; but like the faint rays of an expiring taper now and then emits a flash of light that for a moment chears the gloom of a solitary apartment, and after a few struggles is entirely extinguished. So my heart, which feels a degree of kindly warmth play round it, when I think of your affection, will perhaps a little longer struggle to illumine this frail tenement; then sink to peace in the dark mansion of the grave.— But why should I infest you with my melancholy? I fear I am an ungrateful wretch; for I have found a friend when I least expected it, and one who exerts his power to preserve a life that is no longer of value to me; because it is entirely useless to society. My poor Deborah too, she is still faithful and affectionate. I have still much to be thankful for; but such is the frailty of human nature, we remember our sorrows with a repining mind, while we forget the benefits of which we we are unworthy partakers. I have written this at various opportunities when my time and strength would permit. I shall now dispatch it, as you are I am sure ever anxious to hear from me, I will write again soon, and believe, till my heart vol. iv. L is devoid of all sensation, it will ever love you and pray for your happiness. Adieu! MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LXIV. MERIEL to CELIA. August 19th, 1789. My dear friend, I have once more set down to address to you, to tell you I every day draw nearer and nearer the goal, to which we are all hastening, where I shall again embrace my dear Clementina, and be parted from her no more!—I told you, in my last, that I had unexpectedly found a friend, who had used his utmost endeavours to serve me. It was Mr. Friendly, the gentleman to whose care, my regretted benefactor, Mr. Weldon, so strenuously recommended me before he left England. I was one morning at the warehouse, from whence I had employment, when he came in and with him a woman extremely gay in her appearance; but many years younger than himself. She was what might by many have been called pretty; but to me there appeared nothing in her features that could deserve that name. It was an unmeaning countenance, devoid of sensibility, and if it had any character, it was that of pride and impetuosity. She purchased some very expensive articles, for which he stopped to pay, and she went off in the chariot, to make, as she said, some morning visits. From what I saw, I feared the good old gentleman had entered the matrimonial pale with a person no ways qualified to make him happy; and the event proved I was not mistaken in my conjectures. As I was so greatly altered in person, as not to be recollected by a brother, I could not suppose Mr. Friendly would know me; but I was mistaken; for as I was speaking to the person who was giving me out my work, he turned round hastily and looked at me as though endeavouring to recollect my features. “There are but small remains of the person,” said he, coming toward me, “but I could almost swear that was the voice of Miss Howard.” You know, Celia, I have often been remarked for the softness of my voice, and I believe many, who would not otherwise recollect me, know me the moment I speak. I curtsyed, acknowledged he was right, and left the shop. I had not proceeded many paces before he overtook me, and offering me his arm, with the solicitude of a father, inquired into my circumstances. He had heard I was well married, but nothing more; my present appearance did not confirm the report; he wished to know if he could serve me. Before I could satisfy his laudable curiosity, we had reached the door of the house where I lived. “I have an hour to spare, said he, “may I be admitted, “I cannot leave you till I know how you are situated. I am perfectly acquainted with the goodness of your heart; but I know with all your virtues, you have weaknesses more prejudicial to your interest and happiness than some which are called vices. You are credulous; and you let a sense of duty sometimes hurry you to actions which are not strictly right. Let me know how you are situated; tell me yourself what has seperated you from your husband.” Shall I confess, my dear Celia, shame at the mean apartment I occupied, for a moment crimsoned my cheek; and made me hesitate to admit him up stairs; but gratitude for the kind solicitude he expressed, a reverential remembrance of the noble spirited Weldon, whose friend he was: conspired to conquer this unseasonable emotion of pride, and I led the way to my little garret, (for such it literally is.) Deborah looked surprised at my introducing a man into an apartment, which constituted our dining room, drawing room, bed chamber, and kitchen. But when she heard me mention Mr. Weldon, whose name she knew I respected, and whose friends I should ever consider as mine, she was perfectly satisfied; and when she found the good old gentleman meant to prove his friendship to Weldon, by his attention to me, I thought she would have gone wild with joy. She drew a chair close to his, nor could all my endeavours to the contrary, prevent her informing him of all she knew, concerning Rooksby; and when she mentioned my drawing my subsistence L 2 from labour, and my evident ill state of health; she took his hand and pressed it to her heart; while the tears rolled in big drops down her aged face. I could not see her emotions unmoved: I arose from my seat and pretended to look after the dinner, which Deborah, from her friendly anxiety to promote my interest, had totally neglected; and unseen, gave a loose to sensations which almost overpowered me. Mr. Friendly would not leave me, till he had prevailed with me to give up my employment, to leave the place I then inhabited, and go to apartments, which he would provide a little way out of town.—“You shall not be obliged,” said he, “for I know that is what would most afflict your proud spirit. You think you are humble,” (added he with a smile) “but I know you better. You ever was and ever will be very proud: but I like you the better for it. It is the right sort of pride; it is a pride, which shrinks from the weight of obligation which it has not power to return.—Now to obviate that, you have it in your power to oblige me. I have taken a young creature under my protection, (for I am quite a knight errant in the cause of the ladies,) she is, I believe, a girl of good fortune, and strictly virtuous, but very unfortunate. Now if you will take her for your companion and teach her, as I know you possess abilities, how to amuse at once her time and enrich her mind, I will supply you with the means. Some other time you may learn how I came to take her under my care. Perhaps, she herself, when she perceives the gentleness of your nature, will confide more to you, than from the difference of our sex she possibly could to me. As to the means of your support, I have some connections, in the island of St. John's in America, who send to me for thick cloaks, &amp;c. fit for the climate; now it strikes me that you might make those garments, at a good profit for yourself, and yet leave a sufficient for me.” When I found, he did not wish me to receive obligations from him, without some means to repay them, I was willing to listen to his plan, and in less than ten days from the time I first saw him, I was removed to apartments in Islington, where he sent the young lady to me, whom he had taken under his protection. It was evening when she arrived; I was ill, I was fatigued—had retired to bed and saw her not till the next morning. Oh! Celia, I am very ill now— my head is giddy—I can proceed no farther —perhaps I may never resume the pen.— Let me tell you then, while I have power. This lovely girl is—I can no more— all is dark—and— It was only a faintness. I am very subject to them lately,—I am something better to-day and will, while Deborah permits me, pursue my narrative. The young lady intrusted to my care is the person whom I saw at my brother's; and who, to avoid an union with him, has left his protection for that of a stranger's. She tells me her name is Alton: that she was born in England, but went over to India whilst an infant; that her mother being obliged to go with a lady up into the country left her with a friend, who before her mother's return was forced to retire from the ravages of war: The friend to whose care she was intrusted had no child of her own and at her death left her heiress to a very handsome fortune; the gentleman, who was executor to the will, and guardian to Miss Alton intrusted her to the care of my brother that she might be brought home to finish her education. Struck with her person and the more powerful charms of twenty thousand pounds, he has left no means untried, by which he could hope to win her affection and draw her into a marriage; but she has ever regarded him, as she says, with more horror than any other sensations, when she has considered him as a man designed to be her husband. He was extremely kind and attentive to her, and in return, she respected him and would do any thing to promote his happiness, except sacrifice her own. She knew so little of the world, that she had actually formed a scheme of working for her bread, and did not even think she could oblige my brother to do her justice or place her at a proper school, and pay the sum her guardian allowed both for her education and pocket. She had not confided her real situation to Mr. Friendly, to whom I found chance had introduced her. Poor innocent, in such a place as London, how soon might she have been decoyed, by seeming friends to ruin and infamy. This faintness again. I declare I am as weak as a child, every exertion overcomes me.—Deborah will let me write no longer. God bless you. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LXV. DEBORAH ELLIS to MISS SHELBURNE. Bristol, Oct. 9th, 1789. MADAM, Since my lady dispatched her last letter to you, she has been daily declining and the faintings she mentioned encreased in a most alarming manner. Mr. Friendly did every thing in his power to make her comfortable, and the young lady he placed with her was very affectionate and tender; at one time I was in hopes she would recover. But a circumstance happened, that affected her spirits so much as to make the physicians think it necessary to hurry her to this place for the benefit of the waters. Mr. Friendly generally called on her about twice a week, and though to prevail on my dear lady, to accept assistance from him, he frequently talked and consulted her about work; yet he never sent any to do, always making ?ent"&gt;sent any to do, always making some-excuse about its not being ready. He was, however, fond of talking to her and sometimes he would bring the newspaper and read to her, and whenever he gave her money said it was for the board of Miss Alton. It was one afternoon about six weeks ago, as he sat at tea with the two ladies, a chariot stopped at the door, a very fine lady came out of it, and without any ceremony threw open the dining room door, where they were all sitting: and flying at my dear lady abused her in the grossest manner, accused her of being kept by her husband; for I presently found, madam, that this dreadfully passionate lady was Mrs. Friendly, who had traced her husband to the place where he so often visited, and finding only two women there, she immediately thought one of them must be her husband's mistress, and though my poor dear lady was so ill as might, one would have thought, prevented any such suspicion from being believed, yet did she insist upon it. Mr. Friendly, she said could maintain her there for no other purpose. She called her every vile name, broke the china and was only withheld by her husband from striking the innocent object of her jealousy, who sat as it were stupified with terror, her hands were clasped and rested on her knees and her eyes were fixed on the floor; but she spoke not one word. Mr. Friendly endeavoured to prevail on his wife to go home; but she was deaf to his entreaties, till he promised to accompany her. Just as she was going out, she turned round and wished my lady might starve and die in prison, if ever she encouraged her husband to come there again. “I should like to see it,” said she, “and if I saw you dying, I would not give you a farthing to save you. You have had enough from my poor, credulous, foolish husband already and I hope the next bit of bread you eat that is bought with his money will choak you.” I do suppose, madam, she would have gone on much longer, if her husband had not almost forced her into the carriage, which drove instantly away. When they were gone, my dear lady raised her eyes and clasped hands to Heaven, “for what new trials am I reserved!” said she, “Poor Miss Alton was crying ready to break her heart, and I should have been very glad to see my poor mistress do the same: but she did not shed a single tear. She looked the very picture of uncomplaining sorrow. I was frightened to see her look so composed, and as I feared, her faintings which had kept off for a few days before, now returned with double violence. The next day, a gentleman came from Mr. Friendly, saying, that for family reasons, he could not visit her; but desired she might want for nothing. This gentleman waited, till the Doctor visited my lady, and when he heard his opinion, that Bristol might be of service to her, he desired me to make instant preparations for the journey. I chearfully complied, as I found not only the people, who kept the house, where we lodged, but even the neighbours, had learned something of the visit of Mrs. Friendly, and both my lady and Miss Alton were considered as bad women. We travelled here by easy stages, my lady was greatly fatigued, and for many days I did not expect her to live. The place revived in her mind the loss of her Godmother, who died here about sixteen years ago, when my lady first left the convent. The physicians here, comfort me, by saying, they do not think she is in a confirmed consumption; but that her disorder is chiefly on her spirits, and could that depression under which she evidently labours be removed, she might yet recover, and would undoubtedly, in a rapid manner. Though I fear, madam, she will never lose that depression; yet I cannot but flatter myself something may yet turn out to comfort vol. iv. M her. Surely it were a great pity so good a lady should be cut off in the very flower of her age, and that she, who never wilfully gave pain to any person, should be dying of a broken heart. Indeed, madam it almost breaks my old heart to think of it. She is some days so well, as to be able to walk to the pump room; but she has herself no idea, that she shall ever leave this place. She is perfectly resigned. She desired me to write to you and to tell you, she thinks she shall never be able to write herself again. She offers you every kind wish and bids you pray for her everlasting peace. Those are her own words. One thing I was desired not to mention; but I cannot conclude without doing it. I have written twice to Mr. Friendly, since we have been here: but received no answer. Our money is almost gone, and should he forsake us, what will become of my dear lady and poor Miss Alton, God knows; as for myself, I am old, and could not hope to live much longer; but for them, they have but just entered the world as it were. Pardon me, madam, for writing so much; but I am very uneasy and have no one to complain to or advise with. My lady said to me yesterday, “Deborah, I think I am better: we will dismiss the physician to-morrow.” Poor lady, I knew her motive: she thinks her money will not last long, and that she cannot afford to pay him. I wish to Heaven, Mrs. Onslow was in England or Mr. Kingly. Oh! madam that my dear blessed lady had been the wife of such a man as Mr. Kingly, how happy would she have been; and she might have lived years and years, blessing and blessed by all. But now she is broken hearted, forsaken by the world and with all her virtues will die unpitied and unlamented by all, except a few, who know how good she is; and among which, none will grieve with more sincerity than her and your humble friend and servant, DEBORAH ELLIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LXVI. MERIEL to CELIA. December 22d, 1789. Strange and inscrutable are the ways of Heaven. Once more, my dear Celia, I am permitted to address you, and I have a tale of wonder to unfold, which even at this moment, though I am sensible that I live, I breathe, that all around me is reality, yet, my astonished senses can hardly, credit!—Celia, the heaviest afflictions may lead to the most desirable events. We ought not to complain: every trial, however painful to be borne is inflicted for some wise purpose. Gracious Heaven! when I think, how I have nourished one secret sorrow; how even in my happiest moments have I brooded over it? but it is now removed. That horror, that inexpressible horror, which for so many years has laid upon my mind, is no more. I have been afflicted 'tis true: but I trust I am now safe at least from poverty. My health daily returns, and I can enjoy the heart-felt pleasure of relieving the distressed. But how, you will say, how have these changes taken place? My dear friend, when the tumult of my heart will permit me, I will tell you that I am no longer the friendless, distressed creature, I was not long since. I have a mother living! I have a father too! Blessed! blessed words! and those whom I ever considered as my parents were only relations. Mrs. Howard was sister to my mother.— But let me tell my tale with some coherence: for I think my Celia will imagine me wandering from reason, and that I am writing her the effusions of a distempered fancy. While I was at Bristol, as long as I was able, I went every morning to the pump room. Miss Alton always accompanied me. I there had several times an opportunity of seeing and conversing with Mrs. Harcourt, who was detained there by the ill state of her husband's health, who I found was at Bath at the time I first saw her, which was the occasion of her attending the examination of the persons suspected of robbing her house. She frequently made me offers of friendship, at the same time entreating my confidence: but my spirits were not at that time, in a state to permit me to relate the incidents of my life, most of which had M 2 been so extremely painful, that I endeavoured as much as was in my power to banish them from my memory. Mr. Friendly, from family reasons, I imagine was deterred from inquiring for me, after I left London, and the allowance he had made me on account of Miss Alton's being with me, till he could hear from her friends abroad, entirely ceased when we had been about a month in Bristol, so that I became again in very necessitous circumstances, which added to my having declined the attendance of the physician, and omitted going to drink the waters, on account of my slender finances, encreased my disorder and I soon was confined to my bed. Miss Alton is a tender and affectionate girl and would have confined herself to my bedside, had I not insisted, that she should sometimes walk out. In one of these walks she met Mrs. Harcourt, who inquired after me.— The friendly girl expecting every hour to lose me, burst into tears at the question, described my situation to Mrs. Harcourt and entreated her to come and see me. Her own humanity impelled her to comply, and that very afternoon she came to my apartment. She seated herself by my bedside, took my hand, and was beginning to speak; when Deborah entered the room with some toast and water which she had been down stairs to procure. Mrs. Harcourt started. The glass fell from Deborah's hand; for their eyes met in the same moment. “Good gracious!” said Deborah, “am I awake— are you!—no,—it can't be!—I thought—but 'tis impossible!” Mrs. Harcourt had a little recovered herself. “Yes, Deborah, said she, “it is possible. I am alive still, though so many years thought dead.—But tell me—I almost fear to ask—yet tell me, where is my child? Deborah came near. She took my hand and put it into Mrs. Harcourt's, pressed them together, but remained silent. “Oh! gracious heaven!” she exclaimed, “and is it indeed so?” Then falling on the bed, and throwing her arms round me, she cried, “my child! my darling child! have I found you then, only to lose you?”—Full of astonishment and wonder, I could scarcely ask the meaning of what I heard and saw. “How madam,” said I, “can I be your child? Alas! my dear mother has been many years in the silent grave.”—“You have heard her mention a sister she once had?” “Yes, but I always understood she was dead before I was born.”—“Dead to the world I was,” she replied, “for many years, and from a few weeks after your birth, my sister never heard from me. Many vicissitudes have I experienced, far from England, unable to hear from you, and above ten years in captivity. When I again saw my native land and made inquiry for my child and sister, I was told they were both dead: Nor did I ever think to have been so blest as this; but I must inquire my beloved Meriel, when you are able to answer me. I must know how you have been so long hid from me, and why it was reported you were dead. Are my brother and sister Howard both dead?”— She might have proceeded in her questions uninterrupted; for astonishment had deprived me of the power of speech. Yet perfectly conceiving in a moment the extreme felicity of having a mother! a mother who loved me, my heart also felt lightened of a load of anguish. He, who had attempted my seduction was not my father; he was no relation, only by marriage. Celia, my beloved Celia, cannot you perfectly comprehend the rapture that thought conveyed to my soul. Oh! my friend—I am certain, it is utterly impossible: for you are unacquainted with guilt. The very idea of it inspires you with horror; then, what must have been my feelings on the reflection, that I had kindled a guilty passion, from which nature shrinks back aghast!—But human nature, with all its frailties, could never sink into such depravity.—Unable to articulate a single word, I threw my arms round her neck and overpowered by the pleasing sensations that rushed over my heart, I sunk into insensibility. How long I remained so, I cannot even conjecture; but when I recovered, I seemed as though awaking from a deep sleep, and was full of the idea of a delightful dream.—How charmingly was that dream realized, when putting back the curtain I saw my mother! my kind affectionate mother, sitting by my bedside.—“How are you, my child,” said she, in an accent of the softest maternal kindness. I was extremely faint, and could scarcely answer, but yet I felt better and I told her so. From that hour I began to amend, and was in the course of a few days able to be removed to my mother's house, where I was introduced to my father. Oh! blessed thought, that I should live to say I have a father!—a noble! honourable! father!— whose every action of his life, is an eulogium on the goodness of his heart; reflects a credit on the nation of which he is a native, and the religion of which he is not only a professor, but a strict follower of its precepts. When I was taken from the lodgings which I then occupied, to my dear mother's house, a new source of astonishment presented itself. My mother had a person with her, whom I had often heard her mention as an esteemed friend and companion. The day after I was settled in her family, I was introduced to this lady and discovered in her, tho' greatly altered the person of Mrs. Talbot, whom you may remember Mr. Howard kept in a very unbecoming manner, even in the house with his wife, my dear, though so rigid aunt. She went abroad with a lady, who was following a husband, whom she loved, and who, from necessity, being an officer in the army, had been separated from her. When Mrs. Talbot left Woodbine-cott, she did not know her own situation; but about six months after, she became the mother of a girl. This girl she left in the care of a Mrs. Alton, while she herself accompanied her lady up the country in search of her husband. A variety of incidents, unnecessary here to relate, detained them several years from the place where she left her child. On her return, neither friend nor child were to be found. Celia, do you not already know that this child is the very Miss Alton, whom my brother, as I have been accustomed to call him, would have married. My soul shudders, when I think of the escape he has had. This Miss Alton, is his sister, the natural daughter of his father. Good Heavens! to what sins are mortals led, as it were blindfold; by the vices of their parents. The meeting between the mother and the daughter was very affecting. Mrs. Talbot has retained those good resolutions, with which she has been pleased to say I first inspired her. She lost the friend whom she accompanied to India, when she had been there about six years, and was soon after recommended to the notice of that excellent woman, whom I have now the honour to call mother! with whom she has continued ever since, as a companion, a friend, and the superintendent of her family. When I am more composed, and my strength will better permit me, I will give you a few particulars of the life of this dear, this new found parent; but at present, I am not permitted to devote above an hour out of the four and twenty to writing, and this letter has been the fruit of several efforts. I am called away.—Adieu! Your's while I live. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LXVII. MERIEL to CELIA. January 15th, 1790. In my last, I promised a few of the particulars of my mother's life, and I will now give them without further preface. She was several years younger than Mrs. Howard; and when her sister was married, was still at school. At the early age of sixteen, she became acquainted with Mr. Harcourt, the only son of a wealthy East-India merchant, with whom she entered into the most sacred bonds before any part of either family even suspected there was an intimacy subsisting between them. Her father died soon after this union had taken place, died uninformed of it—and her mother followed him before she had an opportunity to disclose the secret of her situation: for Mr. Harcourt dreaded the anger of his family, should they discover that he had married a woman with so small a fortune as two thousand pounds. My aunt Howard, whom I so long considered as my parent, was then settled, and was the only friend my mother had, to whom she dared impart her marriage, and to this disclosure she was driven by necessity; for she found herself likely to become a mother. Mr. Howard was at that time on a visit to a friend some hundred miles from Woodbine cott, and my aunt offered her sister an asylum, there, till she should be released from her burthen. It was there I was born, and on the very day of my birth intrusted to the care of the faithful Deborah, who had been brought up by my grandmother and married from her house. She solemnly vowed never to divulge the secret of my birth; and when three weeks after, my aunt Howard was delivered of a child, who expired in a few days, it was determined that she should adopt vol. iv. N me and ever take care of me as her own, till it should be in the power of my parents to claim and acknowledge me.—Deborah alone, was privy to the imposture, and worthy has she proved herself of the confidence placed in her. My father's friends having cause to suspect he had formed some attachment, which did not altogether coincide with the plans they had formed for his future establishment in life, had sent him off on a commercial plan to Bengal, whilst my mother was lying in. Distracted by this intelligence, as soon as her strength permitted, she resolved to follow him; and leaving me in the care of Mrs. Howard, she embarked for India; but on her arrival at Bengal learnt that her husband had executed his commissions at that place, and was gone with some English factors up the country: impelled by a pure and ardent affection, she followed the route he had taken, but in vain. War began to advance with horrid strides, followed by devastation and famine, and whilst searching for her husband, my mother fell into the hands of the enemy. Lovely in her person, ornamented with all the charms of youth, she was considered as a valuable prize among the captives, and was sold to a merchant, who purchased slaves for the Grand Segnior. By long and tiresome journies she reached Constantinople and was presented to the royal Turk, but fortunately her person did not please him, and she was only purchased, merely to fill up the number of his wives; without once receiving a visit from him, or being solicited to entertain him in an improper manner. Ten years was she detained in this place, where she says her time would have past pleasantly enough, had it not been for the remembrance of my father and myself; but the thought of what might have become of us, prevented her being happy or receiving the least satisfaction from the various scenes of luxury and amusement that daily surrounded her. In the summer season, the Grand Segnior sent his wives and all the female part of his family in large parties to the different houses he had in the country: and in one of these excursions my mother was struck with the appearance of a slave, who used to walk on a terrace before the windows of the apartments appointed for the women, apparently in a very ill state of health. In the party of woman of which my mother made one was a beautiful turk, who was sister to the Grand Signior, her name was Zayde. She had ever shewn a visible partiality to my mother, and cultivated her friendship with the utmost care. She endeavoured to attain from her instructions some knowledge of the English language, and listened with attention, when she strove to instruct her in the precepts of the Christian religion. This young princess perceiving one day, that my mother regarded the sick slave with fixed attention, took an opportunity to tell her, the slave was hers, that he was a favourite, and had made an impression on her heart. “I love him,” said she, “but I have never told him so. I only endeavour to make his servitude less painful by shewing him every kindness in my power; but whenever I tell him I am sorry to see him so unhappy, and wish I could remove the cause of his affliction, he answers, that his sorrows can never be less, till he is restored to liberty and the love of a beautiful Christian, who alone can render either life or liberty desirable.” “Thus much,” continued she, I can understand; but as I cannot fully comprehend his meaning, I wish you would see and talk to him some evening, when, if you can learn from him, what will be most conducive to his happiness, I will exert my utmost power to procure it for him.”—My mother complied with the request of Zayde, and one evening in the middle of July she accompanied her into the garden to give the Christian slave the promised meeting. The moon was at the full—but the atmosphere was cloudy, and though it was possible to distinguish objects, yet the light was not sufficient to permit a discrimination of features. She addressed the slave in English, told him how much Zayde was interested in his behalf, and begged to learn from him, what could be done to comfort his mind, and assist in the restoration of his health. “I might say,” replied the slave, “that liberty would restore me to all I so feelingly regret—but, alas! lady, I have lost what it is not (I greatly fear) in the power of fate to restore.—Married in early youth to a lovely woman, who, to the charms of an engaging person, added all the fascinating beauties of a pure and elevated mind, and separated from her in the very moment when the delicacy of her situation most required a husband's tenderness and fond solicitude, think what I must suffer from an absence of eleven years, without having once heard whether either herself or child are living. Sent from England by the cruel, pretended tenderness of parents, who valued wealth N 2 above every other earthly consideration— thrown by the chance of war into a slavery, from whence I can never hope to escape; I am, I feel am, lost to the world and dead to every thing but a remembrance of what I have been and what I now am.” “Alas! it is very sad,” replied my mother, bending forward to wipe off the tears she felt trickling from her eyes. Just then the moon broke from the cloud that had obscured her brightness and shed her beams full on the face of the person with whom she was conversing. A scream of mingled surprise and joy escaped her.— It was her husband, who under the same master, for the same term of years had endured slavery, and yet no lucky chance had ever brought them together. Nay, even when she had observed him on the terrace, his visage was ever bent toward the earth, and his hat pulled over his eyes, and she had no opportunity to discover features, which however altered by sickness and sorrow were still fresh in her memory, still dear to her heart. They candidly revealed their situation to the generous Zayde, who was indefatigable till she had contrived the means for their efcape.—“And will not you accompany us,” said my mother, when she informed her of the plan she had laid, and gave into their hands the means of putting it in execution. “No,” she replied, “you my dear friend have taught me the foundation of the Christian religion; it teaches us to compassionate and relieve the distresses of our fellow creatures; but it also teaches us never to forsake our parents. I have a mother living, who is old. She says, I am her only comfort.— It will be wrong to leave her, to deprive her of what constitutes her whole felicity. Go then, my friends, embrace this opportunity of emancipating yourselves from slavery: leave me to the performance of my duty: and pray for me, that though I do not, perhaps, pursue the right Christian mode of worship, yet, that the offerings of a sincere and grateful heart may be accepted at the throne of mercy.”— With eyes and hearts overflowing with gratitude and affection did my parents take leave of this fair benevolent Mahometan; but though they regained their liberty, various incidents prevented their return to England, till within these four years last past. They had frequently written to inquire after me; but never received any answer; and when they arrived were informed from many people that all Mr. Howard's family were dead, except the son, who was abroad.— Mr. Harcourt found that his own family, except some distant branches, were entirely extinct, and that a large fortune waited only his appearance and proper claim. This he is now master of, and to this I am now the acknowledged heiress. Caressed by my parents, respected once more by the world, who now again behold me surrounded by affluence, my health and spirits daily returning, what have I more to wish for?— Alas! Celia, we are never content, and I most ardently desire my poor Rooksby's reformation to complete my felicity.—Kingly too, I could wish to hear that he was well and happy. But I will offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving for the blessings I have received, and for futurity trust entirely to a wise and bountiful Providence, who has never yet forsaken me, and who I humbly hope never will. I have been once to see Kingly's children; my mother went with me: they are both well. Clara's children are at the same school and enjoy the same advantages. Generous Kingly may heaven reward you for the disinterested kindness you have shewn these poor orphans, for indeed they are literally so, being forsaken by both father and mother. My dear Celia, pray for me, that I may support this unexpected, this wonderful elevation of fortune as I ought, that while I share the pleasures of affluence I may never forget the pangs of poverty or turn a deaf ear to the cry of affliction. Adieu! MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LXVIII. FREDERIC KINGLY, ESQ. to COL. ONSLOW. April 16th, 1790. I am returned to England once more; for my mind was so harassed by the thoughts of what might be the fate of my beloved Meriel, that my health declined, and I was advised to solicit an exchange and return to my native place; where the air might restore me. I complied with the advice of my friends, not from any opinion of my own that I was in danger, for the complaints of the mind are so far superior to those of the body, that I was not sensible of my own declining state. Meriel, in affliction, without friends, without support, continually haunted my imagination. On my arrival in England, I went immediately to my agent. He had heard no tidings of her. His heart was not interested; he had therefore made only a few inquiries and finding them fruitless, had given up the search.—I determined to remain a few days in London to rest after the fatigues of my voyage and then visit my dear boys.—My time hung heavy on my hands and I sauntered into a coffee house towards the close of evening. A brother officer accosted me; we chatted a few moments on indifferent subjects, and he proposed going to the play. I accompanied him just to while away the time, rather than from any hope of amusement. Just before the curtain rose, an elderly gentleman entered the box opposite to that in which I was sitting, leading a lady, whom at the first glance, I knew to be my adored, my lovely Meriel. Health again adorned her countenance and sparkled in her eyes; yet there was impressed on her features a sort of pensive shade, which seemed to say, she might be happier. Her dress though, sweetly simple, and becoming, yet bespoke the wearer in affluent circumstances, and the assidious attention of the gentleman, who accompanied her, was evidently the effusions of tenderness. She received them with complacency; nay, returned them with looks beaming expressive affection. A young man in the box with me observed the emotions in my counteance, whilst I regarded her.—“Do you know that lady,” said he,—“I think I do sir, I have some idea that her name is Rooksby.”— “I don't know her name,” said he, “but she is a damn'd pretty creature, and that old fellow deserves to be gibbetted for monopolizing her.”— A chill of horror ran through my heart; can Meriel Howard, said I, mentally, be sunk from that eminence of virtue, which ever distinguished her, into so low, so pitiable a character, as to exist on the wages of prostitution? “Does she live with that gentleman?” said I, to my intelligencer. “'Tis thought so,” he replied, “she is quite a new face. I have seen her often in public with him, and she seldom is accompanied by any one but an old woman, who looks like a convenient.” “And is that all the reason you can give” said I fiercely, “for injuring the character of a woman that ever was, and I trust ever will be free from blemish.” Oh! no,” said he, “when I first saw her, it was at the opera; and I was told she was a woman of that stamp; for she left her husband about a year and a half ago and lived with a young officer of the name of Kingly.” I was going to answer with great warmth and inquire the name of the person, who had thus dared to sport with my character; but my friend interposed and obliged me to quit the play-house without any farther information. This transient glance of my dear Meriel, added to the villainous assertions of the impertinent coxcomb, who vilified her name, had such an effect on my spirits, that rest was a stranger to my eyes. I had not inquired the name of the gentleman with whom I saw her: it was therefore impossible to trace her out. For many evenings I frequented the theatres, the opera-house—every place of public amusement; but was still unsuccessful. She was not at any, or if there, was effectually concealed from me.—Unhappy, ill, disgusted with every object that surrounded me, I determined one morning to visit my children, who I had previously heard, were well, and endeavour to lose my chagrin in their innocent caresses. The school they were at is about twenty-five miles from town. I took a post chaise and arrived at the place about eleven o'clock. An elegant carriage stood at the gate, which drew off to VOL. IV. O give me room to alight. I asked the servant who opened the gate, for my boys. “They are in the parlour,” said he; I followed him, in fancy anticipating their dear embraces. He threw open the parlour door. I advanced and saw, seated at the upper end of the room, surrounded by the four boys, (for Clara's children are there) distributing to them, toys and fruit, the interesting figure of Mrs. Rooksby. Astonishment riveted me to the floor. She looked toward me; joy flashed from her eyes. An exclamation of surprise escaped her, and before either of us had time for reflection, I found I had seated myself beside her and clasped her in my arms, while the dear children were climbing round, each striving to be the first to share my caresses. However joy had for a moment made her forget herself, she soon recovered her usual air of cautious timidity and disingaging herself from my embrace, she presented me to an elderly lady, whom till then I had not observed; and whom she addressed by the endearing title of mother. They proposed taking the children home with them and dismissing my chaise to take a seat in their coach and all return to town together.— During our ride, she unfolded to me a tale of wonder, unnecessary here to repeat; because she informed me she has written your Amelia a full account of it. I am a frequent visitor at Mr. Harcourt's and enjoy her society undisturbed by the fears of the world's censure; for under the shelter of paternal protection, who shall dare to arraign her conduct? She informs me she has not heard from her husband, since his release from the King's bench: but imagines he is wandering abroad with the wild Clara. You will hardly believe it possible, that young Howard, who refused to assist or even acknowledge the dear Meriel, when she was in distress and he thought her his sister, has been to pay his respects to her since he has discovered she is a wealthy relative. She received him politely; but did not ask him to repeat his visit. He is affluent,” said she, “he does not want assistance, and I do not wish to be pestered with his company.” Far different was her conduct to Hester Mossop, who is now a widow with three children and in very indigent circumstances. She met Mrs. Mossop by accident at a perfumer's shop, and judging from her appearance that she was no longer the wealthy, haughty woman, who had never known distress, accosted her in a manner, that encouraged her to make her a visit; nay, she entreated her to do so. From her she learned Hester's necessities, and hesitated not a moment to exert her benevolence to remove them. She inquired after Susan. Tears were the only answer she received.—Alas! poor Susan! seduced by Belger, led into all manner of folly by Clara, she fell from one degree of vice to another, till oppressed by the complicated evils of infamy, disease and a broken heart, she sunk into an untimely grave, in her last hours in want of the common necessaries of life. Meriel gave a tear to her memory and to sooth the affliction of the mother immediately formed a plan for Hester's support. She advanced money for her to take a shop furnished well with haberdashery and hosiery; and by the many recommendations of Mrs. Harcourt, she is likely to gain a very decent subsistence. Young Mossop is married to a rich heiress; but they live in some town very distant from London, and he found it quite inconvenient to write and inquire after his mother and sisters. I hope, now, we shall soon see you in England: I feel uncommonly happy, and I wish you to see and share my happiness.— Methinks, the wheel of fortune has gone its round: and we who have been thrown to the very bottom, are now beginning to rise. I see my dear Meriel enjoying all the comforts, all the elegances of life—caressed, beloved, esteemed by all, and I cannot help indulging the flattering hope, (call it not chimerical) that I shall one day call her mine! Oh! Onslow—when that blest hour arrives! (if such an hour Heaven has in store for me) when I shall see the affection of her faithful heart beam from her expressive eyes, unchecked by fear, I shall think myself at the very summit of human felicity! My kindest remembrances and best wishes attend your Amelia. Ever your's, F. KINGLY. P. S. Previous to Mrs. Rooksby's assisting Hester, the poor creature made the humiliating confession, that it was her artifices, to which she was instigated by her mother, that first separated me from my beloved Meriel; but that noble minded woman frankly forgave her; never witheld her friendship from her, and has never once since mentioned the circumstance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O 2 LETTER LXIX. MRS. ONSLOW to MISS SHELBURNE. November 10th, 1790. You will perhaps be surprized, my dear madam, to receive a letter from a person to whom you are a stranger; but though I never was honoured with the acquaintance of Miss Shelburne, yet she has no doubt heard of Amelia Sidney, who has been so highly honoured by the friendship of our equally beloved Mrs Rooksby.— That lady from a variety of incidents has been prevented from writing to you for several months past; and I am now desired by her to inform you that she is in health; but totally inadequate to the task of relating to you the scenes in which she has been lately engaged.—I know her motive for thus declining a task which she ever considered pleasurable, that of writing to her esteemed Celia is delicacy: she cannot inform you of what has lately occurred, without making mention of her own magnanimity. Her fortitude has ever been conspicuous, it has sustained her under some of the heaviest trials to which the human heart is incident; but in this last she has risen almost above humanity. Pardon the expression; for I am fully sensible how much the human heart is capable of, it is tempered by a great, an all wise Being, who will never inflict trials beyond our power to support;—but we daily see such instances of depravity that we look with a kind of wonder on those who through life maintain that dignified conduct, that purity of manner and universal benevolence which is the true characteristic of Christianity.—But I intrude on your patience, and defer the interesting narrative. To proceed then. On my arrival in England after an absence of six years I was both surprized and pleased to see the alteration which had taken place in the circumstanes of our friend. She had regained all that softness, that delicacy of countenance, for which she has been universally admired; but which sickness and sorrow had when I left her faded into langour. She was chearful and apparently happy; but still some hours of painful reflection would intrude; for she was totally ignorant of the fate of her husband. He might return to England, he might demand her from her father and mother, when he found her the affluent heiress of a large fortune.— These ideas continually haunted her, and sometimes interrupted her most chearful hours. Mrs. Harcourt had invited me to spend a few weeks with them at a seat of their's situated on the banks of the Thames, near Windsor. I accepted the invitation, and had been there near three weeks, when Mrs. Rooksby entered my appartment one morning, pale and ready to saint. She could not speak, but put a note into my hands, which she had just received. It was from Clara—and in a few incoherent lines, represented Rooksby in a most wretched situation, dying and in the utmost distress.— I had known so many instances of Clara's art, that I endeavoured to persuade Mrs. Rooksby from the resolution, she had formed of going immediately to town and administering relief to her husband: but all I could say, joined to the united entreaties of her parents, could not prevail, and all I could do was to accompany her. She ordered the coachman to set her down according to the direction contained in Clara's billet. It was at a mean house in an obscure street in Westminster. We enquired for her husband by the name of Moreton, and was shewn up two pair of stairs into a small back room, where on a bed without hangings, lay all that remained of the once elegant affluent Rooksby, worn to a skeleton, and in the very last stage of a decline, (for he had never recovered the effects of the wound) and riot and intemperance had hastened the period of his existence.—Beside the bed, (supporting his head on her arm, the tears flowing from her eyes) sat Clara: but I could never have conceived it to be the lovely Clara, who had stolen the heart of Rooksby from our dear friend, for her appearance was squallid and miserable. Sunk eyes, pale cheeks, every indication of disease and poverty was marked upon her person.— She turned her eyes towards us as we entered, but without changing her attitude. She has very fine eyes and in spite of their languor still retained sufficient expression, to inform us, that she was equally oppressed by the situation of the poor sufferer on the bed, and shame at appearing in the presence of the woman she had injured beyond reparation. Our excellent Meriel advanced, (checking the powerful feelings of her heart) and as with one hand, she took one of her dying husband's, she extended the other towards Clara: and in accents scarcely audible, bade her be comforted. Struck by such an uncommon proof of benevolence, the poor suffering criminal sunk on her knees. She clasped the hand extended towards her, raised her streaming eyes;— but could not give vent to the fullness of her heart by words. “Go,” cried our magnanimous Meriel, “go, my poor penitent Clara, and compose yourself: I will stay and attend my husband:” then turning to me, she continued, “Shall I entreat you Amelia to return and inform my parents that you have left me in the performance of my duty: that you have left me attending the sick bed of a husband, who raised me from obscurity to an elevated fortune: tell them, I remember not his errors—they were the children of human nature:—but his benevolence will never be obliterated from my mind.—That was the offspring of Heaven.—As she spoke, she waved her hand; I found it was impossible to disobey her, and retired from the apartment—but not from the house. I dispatched a short note to Mrs. Harcourt and then exerted myself to obtain for Rooksby, and my dear rigidly duteous friend, every assistance which money could procure.—It is a sad thing to acknowledge, but so it was, those very people who had suffered Rooksby and Clara to want even the means to support existence, whilst they thought them destitute of friends and money, no sooner saw them visited by persons, who were supposed wealthy, and beheld the contents of my purse, which fortunately was amply supplied, than they were ready to run! to fly! to perform any dirty, or painful work for which they expected to be well paid. But I mean not to make human nature despicable by this observation. These people were poor.—And God knows we may all yield to temptations, when poverty is the strong incentive. I heard from my friend every hour, though she herself imagined I was returned to her father and mother. About midnight I heard an extraordinary bustle up stairs, and on inquiring the cause, found that Rooksby who had never been able to speak to his angelic wife more than monosylables, since her arrival, had been seized with a kind of fit, and was expected every moment to expire. I thought it improper for Mrs. Rooksby to be left in such a situation to the entire care of strangers, and therefore sent up word that I was returned from the country with a message from her mother, and if she pleased would come up. She said, she would be happy to see me. When I went into the room I found her seated on the bed, supporting her dying husband, who was at that time easy and seemingly dozing. His right arm was encircling her waist, his head rested on her bosom, she pointed to a chair by the bedside, but did not speak. On the opposite side of the bed, stood a woman with volatiles which they had been applying to the nose and temples of the expiring man; and at the foot was Clara on her knees her eyes elevated, her hands, clasped, and her whole countenance bearing testimony to the anguish that rent her soul. In my life, I never saw a more interesting scene, nor never I hope shall I witness such another.—I sat down in silence, and in a few moments the Physician, whom Mrs. Rooksby had sent for arrived. He pronounced the patient past all hope, and a few hours confirmed the sentence. It was near seven o'clock, when starting as it were from sleep, he gazed ardently on his wife. “Oh Meriel,” said he, “I dreamt I was in the realms of bliss and you conducted me there. Blessed woman, if you forgive me, if you pray for my enterance into that place of eternal peace; I shall, I know I shall, be received.—“Oh!” said she, with fervour, “May Heaven so forgive my offences as I pardon every offence of yours toward me.—“But Clara,” cried he, “poor guilty Clara!”—“I will be her friend,” replied Mrs. Rooksby. “Enough,” said he, “may every blessing crown you here, and everlasting joys”—He could not finish the sentence, but remained silent and almost inanimate for the space of half an hour. He then moved and took a cordial which she offered him. I prevailed on her to quit her painful situation at the head of the bed and let him lye down. She did so, but he still retained her hand.—Just before the final scene closed, he raised himself a little, and looking earnestly in her face—“My children,” he cried, “my dear boys.”—“Are they not mine,” she replied in an accent to which no words can do justice. “Oh! what a wretch I have been!!!”— said he.—His head sunk on her shoulder, he endeavoured to throw his arms around her, but Death had arrested their power.— He groaned—struggled for the power of utterance—and in that struggle expired. I knew the extreme sensibility of the heart with which I had to deal. I attempted not to console her, I rather encouraged her to give a loose to her feelings, and in a few hours she became sufficiently composed to submit to my direction, and suffer herself to be conveyed to her father and mother: vol. iv. P but not 'till she had given proper directions for the future support of Clara. This unhappy woman confessed in the anguish of her heart, that at the very moment when our incomparable friend gave her assistance and countenance in Devonshire, she was ploting her ruin, that the chief part of the letter she wrote to her, and of which you have had a copy was the invention of her own brain, and that from a very child she has been the offspring of folly.— Mrs. Rooksby heard her confession without any emotion, save that of compassion, and when she had finished, bade her not despair but resolve on a new course of life, and trust in that bounteous Creator for pardon, who never turned from the truly penitent.—She has sent this unfortunate and I may say guilty woman into Wales, were she has become responsible for her board, and allows her ten pounds a year for her pocket and extra expences. The children she has taken entirely under her own care. My dear Miss Shelburne, I cannot help now indulging the most sanguine hopes, that I shall see this worthy woman rewarded for all her sufferings; shall see her soon united to the man to whom for many years she has been sincerely attached, and from whom only the most cruel treachery could have separated her;—for Hester Mossop has confessed that she was the author of those letters which prevented her union with Rainsforth. We do not let Mr. Harcourt know that Hester has made this confession, for he would never forgive her, and I much fear would insist on Mrs. Rooksby's with-drawing her friendship entirely from her. Mrs. Rooksby bid me say she will write as soon as she is able, and in the mean time desires you will believe she can never be otherwise than your friend, and in the same rank begs leave to be placed, Your obliged AMELIA ONSLOW.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER LXX. MERIEL to CELIA.[4] [4] Several letters between this and the preceding, are omitted. Sept. 29th, 1791. I have foreborn to write; because I knew my dear Amelia had informed you of every material occurrence. I knew she had told you that I had promised after my year of mourning was expired, to give my hand to the man, who first possessed my heart. That year was ended on this very day, and I am now the wife of Kingly. I could almost find it in my heart to renounce the name and say, I am the wife of Rainsforth.— My dear Celia, pray for me, that the tide of joy, which now rushes on my heart, may not impair my gratitude, or lead me through my adoration of the creature to forget the Creator, to whom only adoration is due. Oh, Heavenly Providence! am I indeed thus happy—yes, it is a blest reality. I can look up to a father to whom it is an honour to be allied. I can see the sweet effusions of maternal tenderness beam on me from a beloved mother's eyes. I am united to the man of my heart, I am the adopted mother of his children.—Where! where! is there a human being as superlatively happy as myself? happier they cannot be. I can lay my hand on my heart and fervently pray even for the felicity of my enemies. Enemies did I say, I will forget I ever had any, past scenes of sorrow shall be obliterated from my memory, and remembering only the present happiness I will endeavour to deserve its continuation, by exerting the abilities with which I am amply endowed to chear the desponding heart, sooth the afflicted spirits and soften the bed of pain!—Whatever injuries I have received, I will repay with kindness! and looking round the world with a smile of tranquillity, wish every being as transcendently happy as myself! Mrs. Onslow desires remembrances to you. My husband bids me say, should the commotions which at present agitate the Gallic shore, disturb you in your religious retreat; remember, you have a home, to which you can with confidence repair—a home, where you will be received with transport, and where you may consider yourself in the mansion of a sister! Heaven bless and protect you, is the ardent prayer of your friend in sincerity. MERIEL KINGLY. THE END.</field>
