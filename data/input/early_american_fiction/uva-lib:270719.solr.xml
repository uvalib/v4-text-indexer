BE IT REMEMBERED, that on the ninth day of September, in the fifty-fifth year of the Independence of the United States of America, A. D. 1830, Henry H. Porter, of the said District, has deposited in this office the title of a Book, the right whereof he claims as Proprietor, in the words following, to wit: The Betrothed of Wyoming. An Historical Tale. — and must I show Sweet Wyoming! the day when thou wert doomed Guiltless to mourn thy loveliest bowers laid low! When where of yesterday a garden bloomed, Death overspread his pall, and blackening ashes gloomed. Campbell. In conformity to the act of the Congress of the United States, intituled, “an act for the encouragement of learning, by securing the copies of maps, charts, and books, to the authors and proprietors of such copies, during the times therein mentioned”— and also to the act, entitled, “an act supplementary to an act, entitled, `an act for the encouragement of learning, by securing the copies of maps, charts, and books, to the authors and proprietors of such copies during the times therein mentioned,' and extending the benefits thereof to the arts of designing, engraving and etching historical and other prints.” D. CALDWELL, Clerk of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION. During the hot weather of July last, I removed from the oppressive atmosphere of Philadelphia, to enjoy the pure air of the mountains in the upper part of Northampton county. I took lodging in a small public house in a wild glen adjoining Sullivan's creek, a few miles from the village of Stroudsburg. Attached to botanizing, which, indeed, was my chief reason for selecting this wild district as the place of my retreat, I one day rambled so far amidst the sylvan hills in the vicinity, that I became bewildered, and knew not in what direction to bend my way homewards. I wandered for some hours, in much perplexity, among the interminable woods which, on all sides and from every position, obstructed my view. At length, in a small cleared patch of ground, I discovered a log cabin, so rude and ruinous in its appearance, that I might have passed it without observation, had I not perceived smoke issuing from its chimney. This proof of human habitation attracted me. I approached and entered, but found no one within. Persuaded, however, from the appearance of the household matters, that the owner would not be long absent, I seated myself on a bench to await his return. I now leisurely surveyed the apartment, which formed the whole house, and exhibited nothing extraordinary. It will be sufficiently described by saying, that its chief characteristic was unity. It contained no duplicate of any one article. There was but one door, one window, one hearth, one bed, one table, one chair, one long bench, and one large chest which, perhaps, concealed such of its remaining furniture as was invisible. On a shelf, in a dark corner near the roof, my eye after some minutes, caught an object it did not at first perceive—a large book. I took it down. It was a family bible. In this there was nothing remarkable. But in drawing it from its place, which I did rather awkwardly, a bundle of papers fell upon the floor, which I found to be the manuscript of the following history. While, with feelings of surprise and curiosity, I was occupied in turning the leaves of this manuscript, I was startled by the approach of footsteps. I turned round and beheld, entering the premises, a venerable figure, bent by the weight of years, and white with the snow A 2 of age. In the one hand was his staff, in the other a bundle of new-caught fish, and by his side was a large mastiff, who cast upon me a surly look full of suspicion. I felt confused, as if I had been detected in the commission of some petty crime. The old man observed my emotion. “Be not alarmed,” said he, “Rover injures no one without my permission.” “I feel,” I replied, “that I have been guilty of intrusion, and impertinent curiosity.” “As for your intrusion,” he observed in a tone of good nature, “I give you a hearty welcome to my cabin. As for the indulgence of your curiosity, my own negligence alone is to be blamed. I ought to have been more careful of the manuscripts. But it is so long since any visiter has entered my hut, that careless habits have latterly crept upon me, and I frequently wander abroad without even closing my door.” “With respect to the manuscripts,” said I, “I have only discovered their main subject. I know nothing of their particular topics or sentiments. The mischief I have done cannot, therefore, be great, especially as I am willing, in respect even to their existence, to pledge entire secrecy should you require it.” The old man smiled. “Secrecy in relation to these papers, is immaterial,” said he. “But sit down and partake of such refreshments as my hut can furnish, for your ramble into this solitude must have rendered refreshments needful to you.” I accepted his kindness. Our repast was simple and wholesome, such as sylvan nature remote from society, can supply. I enjoyed it with relish, for exercise had sharpened my appetite. When it was finished, my venerable host reverted to the manuscripts. “It has occurred to me,” said he, “that, since you have discovered these papers, it may be more in your power to make a proper use of them, than it is in mine. They record events which, at least in my estimation, are sufficiently important and interesting to claim a place in the annals of the most momentous period that can ever mark the history of our country— her struggle for independence. I will commit them to your care, if you will engage to lay them before the public, and pledge yourself never to reveal what you know of the author until informed of his death.” I readily complied with the terms, and received possession of the papers. At my lodging I perused them carefully, and felt convinced, that if any feeling of patriotism remained among Americans, they could not but become interested in a narrative which details, apparently in the language of truth, instances almost unparalelled in history, of the sufferings to which their forefathers were exposed, and which they endured with the unwavering firmness of martyrs, that they might transmit to their posterity the inestimable national blessings we now enjoy. As some passages of the narrative appeared to me rather obscure, before returning to the city, I again visited the venerable recluse, in order to obtain their elucidation, as well as whatever further instruction respecting the publication of the work, he might be desirous to give. But how exceedingly was I shocked, when, on entering his hut, I found him on his bed in the agonies of death, with no attendant but his faithful dog, who lay whining piteously beside him! I caught his hand and spoke to him in a soothing tone. He recognised me, pressed my hand feebly, and still more feebly, in a tone indeed scarcely audible, said, “Thank Heaven! I die in the presence of a Christian!” These were his last words—in a few moments he was a corpse. My landlord and three or four of his neighbours, assisted me in paying to him the last rites due to mortality. I shed a tear over his grave; and should I live till next summer, it is my intention again to visit that neighbourhood, when I shall place over his lowly bed, a small monument, that the wanderer amidst those everlasting hills, who may accidentally pass the place, may know that it is holy ground. The faithful Rover is now my affectionate companion: I shall, at all times, treat him with kindness, and carefully protect him from the cruelty of our corporation dog-killers. The death of his former master has released me from my pledge of secrecy respecting the author of the following sheets. I, therefore, make the preceding statement with a clear conscience. The Editor. Philadelphia, Sept. 1, 1830.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. Confess his frailty—say he was ashamed Of that for which no man was ever blamed. 'Twas Heaven's own hand that had bestowed on him The slight misfortune of a crooked limb: Yet to his mind, to keep the balance even, Each splendid gift and shining grace was given. Burnside. Pope was a good poet but a bad philosopher. He says that “health, peace and competence,” are all that can be necessary for a reasonable man's happiness. He is mistaken. There are many other things necessary. I shall mention but one—the fulfilment of duty. For some years before the breaking out of the American Revolutionary War, the Reverend Hezekiah Norwood possessed all these in addition to some other ingredients, not necessary to mention, that tend to sweeten the cup of human enjoyment. He resided on the banks of the Susquehanna, in one of the flourishing settlements of Wyoming. Those settlements, at that time, constituted within themselves, a kind of independent commonwealth, having a governor, councils, and laws of their own making. They formed the most western frontier of white population, being separated from all other abodes of civilization by an extensive and unopened forest. Although the nearest neighbours to the Indians, whose hostility was then the source of so many calamities to such of our hardy forefathers as ventured, like them, to become the pioneers of the woods, their peaceable and conciliating dispositions, together with the prudent policy of the public measures adopted in their intercourse with the neighbouring tribes, gained them the confidence and friendship of the savages, and more effectually secured their safety and tranquillity than could have been done by armed bands and fortifications. They were a prudent people, however, and did not altogether neglect the precaution of erecting strong-holds; but in doing so, they had the art not to excite the jealousy of their fierce and revengeful neighbours. The virtue, prosperity, and happiness of the inhabitants of Wyoming, at that period, are topics on which not only historians have delighted to dwell, but from which poets have drawn inspiration as from the only example, in modern times, of a society flourishing in primeval innocence, and affording, in their unsophisticated manners, upright morals, simple habits, uniform hospitality, and patriarchal polity, a pleasing image of the golden age! Separated, as before observed, from the corrupting influences of artificial society, and, at the same time, elevated by education, habit, and feeling, far above the ignorance, coarseness, and barbarity of savage life, they seemed to have adopted the virtues of both, without the vices of either. Such, at least, is the picture which historians have given us of these interesting people. As for the poets, their views of their innocence and happiness may be ascertained from the following stanza of Campbell's well known poem of “Gertrude of Wyoming.” “Delightful Wyoming! beneath thy skies, The happy shepherd swains had nought to do, But feed their flocks on green declivities, Or skim perchance thy lake with light canoe, From morn till evening's sweeter pastime grew, With timbrel, when beneath the forests brown, The lovely maidens would the dance renew: And aye those sunny mountains half way down Would echo flageolet from some romantic town.” Mr. Norwood was the religious instructer of a congregation whose members resided in one of the most pleasant spots in this peaceful region. The name of Wyoming was that of the whole settlement, comprehending a considerable extent of country on both sides of the Susquehanna; but, as it is one familiar to the public, we shall, in this work, apply it also to the village in which Mr. Norwood resided. This village was situated on the western bank of the great river, at the junction which it formed with a small meandering stream, which, as the name by which it is now known, is not very euphonous, we shall call Sharon. On either side of this stream, a gradually ascending ridge of forest-covered hills arose about a mile apart, and stretching from the river for about a mile and a half, began to approach each other, until, at the distance of nearly two miles, they were separated only by the gap through which the stream of Sharon flowed. It was on the northern bank of this stream, at the western extremity of the village, that Mr. Norwood's mansion raised its modest, but tasteful front, embowered amidst a grove of sycamores and poplars. In the year 1776, at the time our history commences, Mr. Norwood had been, for some time, a widower. He was the father of only one child, a daughter, named Agnes, now in her eighteenth year. But such a daughter!— She was in reality, as she was often called, the Rose of Sharon. Every eye admired her beauty; her goodness was the theme of every tongue. She was refined, intelligent, and affable. Her father, by both precept and example, had implanted in her mind a thorough faith in Christian doctrines, and a strong reverence for Christian virtues. In her, his earthly affections were centred; and the most fervent filial piety rewarded his parental love. As perfect equality reigned among the inhabitants of Wyoming, all the maidens of the village were her companions; but there was one to whom she was particularly attached, whose mind, manners and principles harmonised entirely with her own, and produced a reciprocity of confidence which united them to each other in the strictest bonds of friendship. This friend of Agnes was named Mary Watson. Her father and mother were both dead. But their loss was supplied by the kindness of an only brother, a young man who had been educated for the medical profession, and practised as the physician of the district. This youth was possessed of a strong and well-informed mind, but of feelings too sensitive for happiness. In his childhood he had received an injury in one of his legs, which deformed it, and produced an incurable lameness. This deformity preyed more keenly on his mind than his philosophy should have permitted. But what are the suggestions of philosophy to the feelings of an ardent heart? Have they power to restrain the aspirations of ambition or the longings of love? If not, how can they render deformity, which is so great a bar to these emotions, a satisfactory incumbrance? Oh deformity! thou art an eternal source of mortification to the soul that is touched with any desire for eminence or happiness in this world—thou art a perpetually tormenting fiend to thy sensitive victim. Let those who have never experienced the tortures of thy agonizing presence, talk of the virtue of enduring thee with patience, and recommend philosophy as an antidote to the ever-gnawing griefs which thou inflictest. They speak of things they know not, and of sensations they cannot feel. What worldly blessings can render him happy who is cursed by thee? In vain shall health smile, wealth glitter, or friendship sooth, if thou, the everlasting memento of degradation, the inseparable companion of internal sorrow, layest thy vexatious burthen on the crushed and wearied spirit. Often and often did Edward Watson exert the energies of a vigorous mind in resisting the despondency which his malconformation perpetually forced upon his feelings; and occasionally he seemed to gain the victory. But it was only occasionally, and for short periods. In his childhood he had borne the scoff of his playmates, and endured the vexation of being unable to vie with them in the fleetness or dexterity required for their pastimes. His college years, indeed, were less mortifying, as his competitions there did not require bodily so much as mental exertions. Yet even there his disfiguration was not without its annoyances. On any occasion of public display amidst the assembled youths of his own age—in parties or processions, he experienced an humbling sense of inferiority; and in the hours of relaxing exercise, he felt as if he were an outcast from their companionship—unfit to mingle in their feats of strength or their trials of agility. These feelings rendered him averse from mixing unnecessarily with society, or exposing himself to the view of a numerous population. After the death of his parents, he, therefore, persuaded his sister to remove with him from the populous neighbourhood of their birth, near Hartford in Connecticut, to the retired and fertile settlement of Wyoming, among the colonists of which he had many relations who had written him pressing invitations to reside amongst them. He accordingly sold his little property near Hartford, and, with his sister, joining a small party of his neighbours, whose views were directed to the same destination, proceeded to Wyoming. Here he was soon engaged in the successful pursuit of his profession, and might have felt happy amidst a simple and benevolent people, by whom he was respected and beloved, but for the influence of the most pleasing and most irresistible of passions. He loved; but he loved in silence and despair; for when he reflected on his deformity, he imagined that he never could be blessed with a return of affection, ardent and faithful as his own. The object of his passion was faultlessly beautiful in features as well as in symmetry of person. And could he, blemished as he was, and “curtailed of nature's fair proportion,” expect to elicit passion in the breast of one so lovely—one whom many gallant and brave and graceful youths, endowed with all that could recommend them to a lady's eye, loved with ardour and sued in vain. Could one who was so perfect in the love-kindling graces of the outward form as Agnes Norwood—for it was she for whom he pined—cast her regard on him who was unseemly even in his own eyes? “It were vain to expect it,” he despondingly sighed; “I dare not hazard an attempt to win her. I now enjoy her friendship, and her intimacy with my sister affords me often the high blessing of her society. Shall I forfeit this, and expose myself to scorn and mockery, by an imprudent disclosure of my passion? It would be vanity—it would be madness, it would be disappointment, humiliation B 2 and—despair. She would reject—she would avoid—she would despise me.” Though his heart was thus torn with a secret and hopeless passion, and preyed upon by the melancholy reflections which had embittered his whole life, yet to the public eye he appeared neither morose nor fretful. His repinings were confined to his own bosom. His sister, indeed, had long known the extent of his early and irremediable sorrows; and suspicions of the additional unhappiness which he now endured, had sprung up in her mind; and her anxious, but silent observations, soon ripened them into certainty. She loved her brother with the tenderest affection. She sympathised in his sufferings, and keenly felt all his woes. But she never alluded to them. Her good sense told her that they shrunk from observation, and were of too delicate a texture to bear the gentle touch of even a sister's kindness. Her chief study was to render agreeable to him, the enjoyments of home, and to sooth him with those daily comforts which the female manager of our household concerns alone can supply. He was not unobservant of these attentions. He felt grateful for them. They endeared his sister to him. They made him feel that the world was not a desolation; that it contained at least one being who loved him, and was solicitous for his happiness. He thanked Heaven for the blessing, and felt that his existence was not altogether in vain, while it contributed to the support and satisfaction of one so affectionate and worthy of his regard. On her account he pursued his calling with industry, and assumed a cheerfulness in society little accordant with the internal state of his feelings. Mary Watson was not a beauty in the pictorial sense of the word. But she was far from being disagreeable to look upon. Benevolence and good nature ever shone from her countenance. Her features were sufficiently regular, but they were marked by some traces of the small pox; and her complexion, though indicating health, boasted but little of the delicate intermixture of the rose and the lily which animated the blooming countenance of her friend Agnes Norwood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. Behold the pest of civil strife, Destructive foe of human life, He comes, with havoc in his train, And rides on ruin o'er the plain! Sefton. In the year 1776, the tempest of civil war gathered fearfully over this continent, and frowned with peculiar wrath on the region of New England. The cause of American liberty had aroused that section of the country to arms, even before the sister colonies had determined on a union of strength to expel foreign dictation and secure independence. But on a question so important, one involving so many conflicting opinions, feelings, and interests as that which then agitated the country, it could not be expected that there would be unanimity of sentiment and action. Many opposed, even by force of arms, the cause of their country, and the names of Whig and Tory became the distinguishing appellations of parties that were more fiercely arrayed against each other, than the factions so called had ever been in Great Britain. The tories of New England had exerted themselves very early in the struggle. But they constituted, although a bold, a very small minority in that patriotic section, and were soon subdued. Among the most troublesome and dangerous of the bands into which they formed themselves, was one commanded by an enterprising and daring youth of Connecticut, named Butler. His father had held a lucrative and honourable office under the British government, and had been one of the first to assemble all who were attached to the old regime, and raise the standard of Toryism. His excessive zeal rendered him imprudent, and in a rash attack upon a party of the patriots he was taken prisoner, tried for treason, and executed. His son, John, already mentioned, assumed the command of his party, and vowed revenge upon the Whigs for the destruction of his father. He was well qualified to be the leader of a desperate gang. Intrepid and fearless, but wily and sagacious, he was equally capable of contriving stratagems and of performing exploits. Unscrupulous, unprincipled, and fruitful in expedients, with wonderful celerity he could retrieve the most disastrous mischances; and often when his enemies supposed that his power of doing mischief was annihilated, he would suddenly come upon them with renewed force and fury, and make them feel that his arm was as strong, and his heart as relentless as ever. His personal qualities, as well as those of his mind, fitted him well to be a leader of desperate men engaged in a marauding warfare against the recognised authorities of the land. At once agile and athletic, and of vigorous health, he was capable of enduring any fatigue, and sustaining every privation to which the adventurous and dangerous courses he pursued so frequently exposed him. He had also an air of dignity and loftiness in his appearance, which contributed much to secure him the complete ascendency he possessed over his followers. Many and terrible were the slaughters, the burnings, and the desolations committed by Butler and his guerilla band on the fairest portions of Connecticut. His name soon became so terrible, that rewards were offered for his apprehension, and the militia of the country made every effort to effect his destruction. He was at length taken, carried to New Haven, and condemned to the same fate his father had borne, a fate which he had so cruelly avenged, and so amply deserved. But he died not. Love saved him. Oh! what is so faithful! what is so energetic! what is so precious to man as woman's love! Isabella Austin loved the traitor, although she approved not the treason, for her father's family were Whigs. She deceived his gaoler—she procured admission to the convict; and the same stratagem which afterwards saved the life of the celebrated La Vallette, now saved that of John Butler. Uriah Austin, the father of his deliverer, and his family, with some other families in the neighbourhood, were then preparing to fly from the war-scourged plains of New England, in search of repose and safety in the valley of Wyoming. By the entreaties of his daughter, and influenced by his own feelings of compassion, Mr. Austin was prevailed upon to grant shelter and protection to the fugitive whose principles and conduct he reprobated, but who now threw his life into his hands and assumed the mask of penitence, professing his desire to accompany his protectors to the country of Wyoming, where some of his relatives were already settled, and where he solemnly pledged himself to lead a life of peace. The good hearted Mr. Austin consented, and even promised, in the event of his continued amendment for a length of time sufficient to prove its sincerity, to consent to his union with his daughter. It was early in the month of May, 1776, on a day beautiful and serene as the unclouded sun in spring ever illuminated, that a company of travellers, with their wives and children, numbering altogether about fifty persons, were seen pursuing their way slowly along the right bank of the Susquehanna in the direction of the village of Wyoming. They were accompanied by a numerous drove of cattle, and about a dozen teams, to which were attached large wagons laden with all the requisites of household comfort. Interspersed among these, at irregular distances, a number of smaller vehicles, chiefly gigs and dearborns, bore along the females and the children, the aged and the infirm of the party. In advance of these, two active young men, armed, as if for the chace, with rifles and hunting knives, pursued their way on foot at a much brisker rate than the rest of the company. These, aided by a couple of pointers, were on the look-out for game, as the wild deer and the wild pigeons were then abundant in the woods. Of the latter they had made considerable prey, when, considering that they were now some miles separated from their friends, they sat down on a bank that overlooked the river, at a turning of the road, to await their approach. The impressive stillness of undisturbed nature was around them. The river lay in a smooth and glittering sheet, like an immense mirror, beneath them, while a sombre forest stretched far beyond it, whose tall tops seemed to touch the heavens at the verge of the horizon. Behind them at a very short distance, an oak-bearing mountain, one of those that separated the surrounding country into so many fruitful and pleasant valleys, raised its lofty summit to the skies, as if it would penetrate the secrets of the elements above. “How solemn is the deep tranquillity of the magnificent scene now before us!” said Henry Austin to his companion, John Butler, the fugitive from justice, with whom the reader is already acquainted. Henry was the only son of Uriah Austin who had afforded Butler his protection, and the only brother of Isabella, who had saved the life of that offender. He was at this time little more than twenty years of age; warm, open, and generous in his disposition, and so zealous in the cause for which his country was then struggling, that he panted to enrol himself amongst her defenders; and but for the commands of his father, whom he never yet had ventured to disobey, he would, ere this, have arrayed himself in their ranks. Although Butler, in his heart, disliked the patriotism of this brave youth, he was aware of the imprudence of, at this time, expressing his feelings; and, with profound dissimulation, he continued to affect penitence for his former conduct. In reply to Henry's remark, he said, “this tranquillity forms a striking but pleasing contrast to the scenes of tumult, strife, and C blood, in which I was so lately engaged; but which, thanks to your generous-hearted sister, I now, from my very soul, abhor.” “What is past cannot be recalled,” replied Henry. “It is useless to grieve for it. When penitence is sincere, it ought to procure the forgiveness of error. But let us not allude to the past when its memory is unpleasant. Let it sink into forgetfulness; and let the future engage our attention. Our country is, at this moment, engaged in a tremendous struggle against a powerful foe.—Oh! that I could fly to her assistance.” “Your enthusiasm is natural to your youth,” said Butler, with an internal sneer. “But, my dear Henry, you cannot be every where; and you are now where your duty requires you, comforting your parents in their old age, and assisting them to find a place of safety from the terrors of the times.” “I should, indeed,” replied Henry, “be unwilling to desert my friends in their present circumstances. But the very repose of this mighty solitude that surrounds us, recalls to my mind, by the force of contrast, the agitations, the dangers and the sufferings that now shake our native land to its centre, and overwhelm thousands of her sons and daughters in irretrievable ruin. When I think of this, I cannot but sigh, that I am prevented from hastening to her aid; and, if she conquers, to share in her glory, or if she falls, to partake of her calamities.” “Your patriotism is sublime!” said Butler, with an irony of tone which Henry's inexperience of hypocrisy prevented him from observing. “The profound silence of the present scene is, indeed, strongly distinguished from the sounding of the trumpet, the echoing of the bugle, or the roaring of the cannon, and all the other clamours of brazen-throated war, which now roll their alarums along our sea-board, from Boston to Savannah. But should we not bless Providence, that those we love best are so far removed from those clamours, and that we are present to defend them from whatever dangers may assail them?—for even here danger may come.—Yes, Henry, tranquil as things now are amidst this remote solitude, your martial ardour may yet be needed even here. The savage prowler, whose amity is so uncertain, is in the vicinity.” At this moment their attention was drawn to a tall man of rather elderly appearance, clothed in a wild mixture of savage and civilized apparel, hurrying down the mountain behind them. He soon approached, and addressed them with hasty utterance— “White men—Christians—if ye have any of the compassionate feelings which Christians are said to possess, haste with me to rescue from the cruelty of the savages, two young females of your own nation, who have fallen into their hands!” “Lead on,” cried Henry, “we will follow;” and Butler echoed the reply. The hill was soon ascended; and about twenty minutes' rapid race along its summit, brought them to a steep and dangerous declivity, down a narrow and scarcely traceable path of which their aged conductor plunged with unhesitating alacrity, and they as fearlessly followed. At length, on coming to a tall and precipitous rock, the base of which reached to the bottom of the hill, their guide halted. “Let us now proceed more cautiously,” said he. Then in a stooping posture, so as to be concealed by the brushwood, he preceded them slowly and in silence for a short distance. The brushwood then terminated, and afforded them a clear view into a small glade in the valley beneath them. “My part is now done. What remains is yours,” said the old man, and he disappeared. Our adventurers beheld two white females seated on a log; and three savages, two of whom were employed at a large fire, apparently preparing food, while the third seemed to act as sentinel over the females. A short consultation soon determined the measures they should adopt. They cautiously descended a little lower among the brushwood, till they approached near enough to take a sure aim, when, both firing at the same moment, two of the Indians fell dead. The third seized a musket; but the assailants being sheltered by a large tree, were secure from his fire, until they had time to re-load. But before that had taken place, another Indian, who had been straggling a short distance from the group, appeared upon the scene, armed also with a musket. Instead of firing, however, the two savages hastened from the glade to take shelter behind the adjoining trees, which they reached in safety. Austin and Butler were now, for a space, perplexed how to proceed. But the latter, being experienced in every mode of bush-fighting, soon determined on his measures. Instructing his companion to remain stationary, with his rifle displayed so as to deceive the Indians, he cautiously approached them in a circuitous direction, concealed by the woods, until he gained a sure aim at one of them, whom he shot through the heart. The other, with a loud yell, darted from his station, exposing himself, C 2 in his flight, to the view of Austin, who fired, but missed him. The savage, now that both his antagonists had discharged their pieces, rushed, with desparation, towards Austin, who, in a few moments, found himself in contact with his furious enemy, whom, with one blow of his rifle, he felled to the earth. On account of the tree which protected him, the Indian had found no opportunity of firing at him until he received the blow which disabled him from firing with effect. The gun was discharged in the scuffle, but its contents lodged harmlessly in the side of the hill. In an instant, however, the savage was again on his feet. He was a powerful and active man, and Austin would have had a dangerous and difficult struggle to undergo, had not his antagonist perceived the approach of Butler. One leap carried him almost to the bottom of the hill, where he plunged amidst the thickest of the woods, and disappeared. The attention of the victors was now directed to the females, who had fled, with terror, into the woods, at the commencement of the combat. But the extreme thickness of the undergrowth rendered it impossible for them to proceed far. They, however, secreted themselves, and anxiously awaited the issue of the contest. Finding that their deliverers were victorious, they re-appeared to express their gratitude and throw themselves on their protection. But who can imagine the sensations of Henry Austin, when he beheld so lovely a being as Agnes Norwood, kneeling to return thanks to Heaven for her deliverance, in effecting which he had the happiness of being so instrumental. Her amiable companion, Mary Watson, who knelt beside her; his own companion and colleague in the victory, Butler; the slain Indians; the whole scene of woods and mountains, earth and the heavens, that surrounded him, all—all were forgotten, or rather extinguished in the absorbing sensation of that enrapturing gaze with which he beheld her. And she, when her grateful outpourings to Heaven were finished, and rising to salute him, for the first time noticed his ardent gaze, and surveyed his generous countenance—she, too, felt as if there was none but him in the world.—From that moment, indeed, they became all the world to each other. On that spot, and in that moment, love exerted his supremacy over two youthful hearts as pure, as fervent, and as faithful as ever beat in human bosoms. It is true, they were entire strangers; they knew nothing of each other; and yet they felt as if they, for the first time, beheld beauty and perfection, of whose existence they had been long aware, but which had never before been presented to them in a vision so full of truth, blessedness, and love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. Fierce prowler, to thy woods away, Why should the virtuous be thy prey? Why doth thine eye licentious rove On maiden's charms for maiden's love? Or is it vengeance fires thy heart, To act the unmanly ruffian's part? Sefton. The outrage upon Miss Norwood and her friend, of which we have been speaking, was the first that had been committed by the Indians, on any of the inhabitants of Wyoming, for many years. It was, therefore, totally unexpected, and threw the whole district into the utmost consternation. It was caused by the intestine commotion which then agitated the whole continent. It was one of the remote heavings of that might commotion which effected such a change in the destinies of man— the American Revolution. A crisis was then taking place in the fortunes of the western world, and such a one as was not to be accomplished without a violence, which shook the fabric of society, and was felt at the most extreme verge of civilization. The outrage we are now considering, was excited by some fugitive tories from New England, who had taken refuge among the savages. Its origin was, in truth, closely conneeted with the affairs of Butler, although, ignorant of the circumstance, he was so instrumental in defeating and avenging it. His prosecutors, the Whigs of New Haven, had many relations among the settlers of Wyoming. In revenge, therefore, for the condemnation passed upon him, which it was not doubted would be executed, as well as in resentment of the patriotic principles which predominated in the settlement, some of his gang, after its dispersion in Connecticut, fled to the country of the Mohawk Indians, and exerted every artifice to inflame them against the settlers. The Mohawks were ready enough to hearken to these instigations, not only on account of their desire for plunder, but also of some claims which they had to a portion of the lands occupied by the settlement. Their chiefs, however, would not rashly engage in such a war. The neighbouring whites, with whom they had long lived on peaceable terms, had given them no recent cause of offence. Besides, in the quarrel between the government of Britain and the colonies, they believed that their wisest course would be to remain neutral. Old resentment against the colonies, however, operated in their minds. They had not forgotten the usurpation of their lands, and the exterminating wars so frequently waged against their race. While, therefore, they refused as a nation to commit any act of hostility, they permitted it to be understood that they would not too strictly scrutinize the conduct of any individuals of their tribe who might join the tories in their depredations on the whigs, or undertake of themselves, any enterprise against the frontier settlements. In consequence of this tacit permission, many of the more adventurous Indians began in small parties to harass the colonists for the purposes of plunder or revenge. The seizure of Agnes Norwood and her companion, Mary Watson, the issue of which has been narrated, was the first of a series of outrages which the inhabitants of Wyoming were destined to endure from the spirit of hostility thus awakened in the minds of the savages. The suggestion of one Silas Bateman, a zealous partizan of Butler, was the immediate cause of this outrage. He applied himself to a half-breed Indian of a daring and ferocious character, who possessed great influence among the Mohawks. This man's name, which has since become infamous in history, was Brandt. He had, for some time past, harboured much animosity against the people of Wyoming, and particularly against Dr. Watson, of whose character the reader is already apprised. This arose from the following incident. About two years before the present adventure, Brandt had accompanied a trading party of his tribe to Wyoming. While there, in a fit of intoxication, he quarrelled with one of the inhabitants, whom he wounded with a knife, so dangerously, that recovery was not expected. Brandt was arrested, and the evidence of Dr. Watson, who had witnessed the affray, was decisive against him. He was convicted; but as the person whom he wounded, had not died, he was only sentenced to some months imprisonment, a punishment to which the leaders of his tribe gave their consent, acknowledging it to be just. Brandt, however, considered himself disgraced, and resented it exceedingly. Before half the term of his sentence had transpired, he broke from prison and escaped; his bosom glowing with revenge against the whole of the population of Wyoming, but particularly against Dr. Watson, whom he looked upon as the principal author of his disgrace. He was, therefore, a willing listener to the suggestions of Bateman, and a ready instrument in his hands, to execute any enterprise of violence against the objects of his resentment. Accordingly, as soon as he understood that the chiefs of his tribe would be willing to overlook whatever outrage he might commit upon the whites, he, in conjunction with three of his boldest and most zealous confederates, undertook the enterprise which, as we have seen, terminated so disastrously for his party, he himself being the only one that escaped. His chief object was the destruction of Dr. Watson. But in this he was disappointed, the intended victim happening to be from home at the time of the attack. The doctor's house being situated in the outskirts of the village, was easily assailed; and the attack was made at a late hour in the evening, when the assailants supposed there was little danger of alarming the inhabitants before the completion of their design. Unhappily for Agnes Norwood, she happened to be on a visit to her friend at the time the marauders entered the house. The only other inmates were a male and a female servant. The former in attempting to resist the entrance of the savages, was killed; the latter escaped by a back door, and hastened to alarm the village. The savages perceived this, and knowing there was no time to plunder or destroy any of the property, they seized the terrified Agnes and Mary, stiffled their cries by gagging them, and carried them off. The direction of their flight was not known to any of the villagers, and although an active pursuit was soon commenced, it was in vain. But Providence D sent deliverance to the captives from another quarter. An old man, of singular habits, and mysterious conduct, usually known by the name of the “Hermit of the Woods,” made his haunts in a secluded and rugged valley some miles distant. Here, the day following the outrage, he discovered the savages, with their captives, encamped for the purpose of rest and refreshment. Having, from the arrangements they were making, satisfied himself that they intended remaining there for the night, he set off with the design of apprising the people of Wyoming, when, on his way, he met with Austin and Butler, as before stated. On the return of Agnes and Mary under the protection of their deliverers, to their disconsolate friends, the joy of the inhabitants of Wyoming may be easier imagined than expressed. The sincerest gratitude towards their deliverers pervaded every bosom. Austin and Butler became favourites throughout the whole settlement. The toryism and late misconduct of the latter, though they were universally known, were universally forgiven. His conversion from error was considered sincere; and, whatever had been his guilt, it was amply atoned for by the important service he had now rendered. As for Austin, there was no drawback upon the esteem in which he was held. The arrival of his friends was hailed as a valuable acquisition, which, in truth, it was, to the strength and resources of the colony. It may be imagined that among those who felt most gratitude for the services, and esteem for the virtues, of Henry Austin, was to be found the father of Agnes Norwood. The fervour with which he strained his hand to his heart when, with tears of joy, he thanked him for the preservation of his daughter, imparted to Henry's feelings a thrill of delight that would have amply repaid, a thousand-fold the degree of danger he encountered in the performance of that happy achievement. Butler, too, received from Mr. Norwood the thanks which he deserved. But his experienced eye perceived the superior fervour with which the reverend gentleman, perhaps unconsciously, addressed his companion. He also observed the looks which spoke a feeling much warmer than the warmest gratitude, that brightened the countenance of the lovely Agnes, whenever she would rest her eyes on the happy Henry. The fiend of jealousy, from that moment, seized upon the depraved spirit of Butler. He began to hate Henry; and forgetful of the obligation he owed his sister Isabella, and the impassioned vows he had often pledged to her, he began even to dislike her. A new and fiercer flame, inspired by the superior charms of Agnes, had arisen in his breast. But he was an adept in deception, and had the art to conceal the change in his feelings, and even to conduct himself in such a manner as to gain upon the esteem of those he hated. He had several very influential relations in the colony; one of whom, a cousin, named Zebulon Butler, with whom he chiefly resided, was so popular, that he was, shortly after this period, elected commander of the small army which the inhabitants raised for their protection from any future aggression of the Indians. This circumstance had, for a time, some influence in counteracting the effects of Butler's jealousy of Henry, and his increasing hatred of the Austins. He hoped that he might yet, by adopting a popular course of conduct, raise himself to an equal influence with his cousin; and acquire such a degree of authority in the colony as would enable him to accomplish his views of matrimony, with the fascinating Agnes, in despite of the present favour enjoyed by his rival. Henry, in the mean time, did not dream of the alteration that had taken place in the feelings and designs of Butler. He conceived that gratitude and love had bound him firmly to his sister, and to the interests of all her friends. His professions of attachment to the popular cause seemed to be unquestionably sincere, and as it was a cause in which Henry was an enthusiast, he could not but esteem him the more for that attachment. Henry, therefore, treated other as an assured friend, who had shared with him the glory of a noble and fortunate exploit, and was likely soon to become nearly connected with him by a union with his only sister. Every man must have experienced that there are some characters in this world, whom we may believe that we have every reason to esteem and think trust-worthy, and yet, although we cannot tell why, we feel unable to open to them all our minds, or bestow upon them our unreserved regard. There is an indefinite something about them which renders us backward in yielding them our confidence; and, in despite of ourselves, limits even the extent of our good wishes for them. Henry possessed this feeling in respect to Butler, even at the period of their closest intimacy. He was sorry for it. He blamed himself for a repugnance he could not help. He ascribed it to prejudice against his former course of life. Often did he combat with it as an unworthy feeling: but in vain. With all his efforts, he never could become the unreserved friend and thorough admirer of D 2 Butler. Frequently did he feel sorry for his sister's infatuation in loving this man; and, although her happiness seemed to depend on a union with him, he often felt as if he could wish some event to take place which would frustrate its accomplishment. But there was one man in the village to whom he delighted to open his heart; one whose integrity of soul, (although he was to him, as yet, but a comparative stranger,) he felt as if he would be committing an act of dishonour to doubt —one who, although reserved and unobtrusive, had acquired his esteem so entirely, that he perseveringly sought his friendship until he gained it. This person was Dr. Watson. On his principles he had reliance, and in his confidence he felt safe. Many were the pleasant and instructive hours these sincere friends passed together in the shade of the tall oaks that skirted the broad rolling Susquehanna. The attachment that existed between Henry and Miss Norwood, was well known to Dr. Watson. There were, indeed, but few people in the village who did not surmise it. Love affairs are mighty matters in small villages; and usually furnish the most frequent and interesting topics of gossip which the uniform tranquillity of rustic seclusion can supply. Henry had not been many weeks a resident at Wyoming before the good natured villagers had set him down as the destined husband of Agnes Norwood. In the estimation of all prophetic spirits, it was so suitable, it was so likely, it was so just the thing, that it could not but take place. There was only one individual in the settlement that dissented from this arrangement of the good villagers, or felt hostile to its accomplishment. This individual was John Butler. His conviction of their mutual attachment gnawed at his heart; and every allusion to it, by the gossips of the place, stung him like a scorpion. He, however, was a consummate master of duplicity, and preserved a strict silence on the subject, affecting to occupy his mind with more important concerns. But he had internally vowed that their union never should take place, during his life, without being cemented by blood. How different were the feelings of Dr. Watson! He loved Agnes as passionately, but he loved her more purely, and with a heart so entirely and exclusively devoted to her welfare, that he ardently wished for her union with the man she preferred, especially since he knew that man to be so eminently qualified to render her happy. Such was the contrast between the characters of Henry's rivals—the contrast between virtue and vice!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. Oppression's iron reign is o'er, Our bonds are burst, we're slaves no more. Let the triumphant clarion swell The glorious news abroad to tell; And let our heartfelt jubilee Declare our native land is free. Sefton. It was a beautiful evening about the middle of July, 1776—Shall I describe it? Nothing would be easier—nothing more agreeable. All its features are, at this moment, glowing as vividly in my mind's vision, as ever the charms of the fairest landscape shone in the corporeal eye of a poetical admirer of the glories of nature. But summer evenings, under every variety of appearance, have been described so often and so well, that there is nothing left for me to say; and to repeat epithets which, however appropriate and just, have, at this age of literature, become trite and familiar, would be worse than supererogation—it would be a useless expenditure of my own time, as well as that of my readers. On the evening to which I refer, Henry Austin and Dr. Watson were enjoying the cooling breeze in a favourite retreat among linden trees, on the bank of the stream of Sharon. The great drama of the times—in which all the daring spirits of the land were engaged, was the subject of their conversation. “I cannot understand,” said Henry, “how any American, who has the feelings of a man, can take part with a government that would bind his country in the fetters of arbitrary power; for to lay on imposts at will, is to exercise such power. Slaves alone can be made the objects of unlimited exaction—the bearers of involuntary burthens. The conduct of our tories is, to me, quite inexplicable.” “The opinions of men,” observed his companion, “even on subjects apparently the least liable to controversy, are so various, that mere difference of sentiment on this great question, does not surprise me. I can imagine and believe that even good and intelligent men may feel a conviction that the mother country has just claims to the prerogative she has attempted to exercise. But that any number of men should be so zealous for such sentiments, as to enforce them by the destruction of their nearest friends, affords, indeed, a theme for astonishment, and implies motives of action which I cannot comprehend. The destructive hostility of men towards each other, for mere difference of opinion, which our country at present too fatally experiences, appears to me the height of criminal infatuation, inexplicable on any principle of rational sense or natural feeling.” “If those who have resisted the encroachments of British authority,” said Henry, “had, in the first instance, denounced all who would not join in that resistance, self-defence would have justified the tories in acting as they have done. But no such denouncement took place. All men were invited to repel the unjust aggression of Britain, but none were forced to do so—and I am aware of no instance of violence exerted by the patriots against any whose dissentient opinions did not carry them into overt acts of devastation or bloodshed.” “The moderation and forbearance of the friends of liberty, amidst the most galling provocations,” answered the Doctor, “are, in truth, worthy of admiration, and augur favourably of their final success. Contrasted with the ferocity of the opposite faction, what praise does it not deserve? But, oh, my friend, if there had been any means of avoiding the unhappy struggle, without sacrificing the most invaluable rights, how much suffering and sorrow would have been avoided; and what cause would humanity have had to rejoice! The details you have given me of scenes you have yourself witnessed, and the accounts which we almost daily receive of the events passing in our cities and populous districts, are truly heart-rending. Would to Heaven that rulers could appreciate the evil effects of, at any time, driving a gallant people into the resistance of wrongs?” “The calamities that overspread the country, and will continue to do so while the contest lasts,” said Henry, “are indeed to be deplored. But if they are the price at which the liberty of the country is to be purchased, surely no patriotic heart will grudge the payment. The object for which we have chosen to encounter the evils of war is glorious. If we attain it, generations yet unborn will enjoy its benefits, and honour our names, and bless our memories, for the sacrifices we shall make. This is the consummation to which our patriots look forward, as the glorious recompense of their toils, their dangers, and their sufferings.” “If,” said the Doctor, “the great measure of proclaiming our country independent, now in agitation by Congress, were once adopted, I should then less grudge the sacrifices and the miseries that the generous and the brave of the land are destined to undergo. The contest would then have a definite aim to which every eye would be directed. There would be a fixed point, an established and ascertained object, round which every noble heart would rally, and to defend which every valiant arm would be raised. But, at present, the unsettled and undetermined, nay often discordant views of our best patriots, distract their councils, disconcert their measures, and expose their cause and their country to many misfortunes and much distress, from which they might otherwise be exempted.” “There is reason to hope,” replied Henry, “that affairs will not remain long in this unsettled condition. Our congress consists of a body of men of as firm, fearless, and patriotic minds, as ever were assembled; and it is confidently believed, that the members are well aware that the salvation of the country depends on the adoption of this great measure. For myself, I have full reliance on their wisdom and integrity, and have not the slightest apprehension that they will shrink from their duty.” At that moment the Hermit of the Woods— the old man who had conducted Henry and Butler to the rescue of Miss Norwood and her friend—stood before them. “Rejoice Americans!” said he—“You are now a nation. The yoke of the foreigner is broken. The mighty voice has gone forth which every land shall hear with delight, and every tyrant with dismay, that you are FREE AND INDEPENDENT. Arouse all your energies to maintain the glorious privilege, ye men of the new-born nation, for to do so your lives, your fortunes, and your sacred honour, are pledged in the sight of Heaven and of the world!” “Whence is thy intelligence, Rodolph?” asked Dr. Watson. “Thou dost not doubt its accuracy? my son,” inquired the Hermit. “No, I have never heard aught but truth from thy lips,” replied the Doctor. “But, to us, thy news is so important and interesting, that to know all its particulars will be grateful to our hearts.” “Yesterday,” said Rodolph—“by express from Philadelphia, the tidings reached Allentown. The blessed Declaration was read in an assembly of the people. I heard the banks of the Lehigh resound with the acclamations of the multitude; and I hastened hither with the joyful intelligence. Here is, in print, a copy of the sacred instrument of your freedom. Make it known to your people. Let them raise the voice of thanksgiving to Heaven; and dedicate, for ever, to jubilee and joy, the birthday of their nation!” So saying, he handed to Dr. Watson a printed copy of the Declaration of Independence, and hastily disappeared. The delight with which the patriotic people E of Wyoming received this important intelligence, was expressed by long and fervent acclamations, the discharge of fire arms, the parading of their little military band, the blazing of bonfires, and other demonstrations of public rejoicing usual in remote villages. The day following the arrival of the news, Mr. Norwood invited the people to assemble in his church, where, after reading to them the great charter of their freedom, he addressed them as follows: “My fellow citizens: You have just heard the most important public manifesto that ever was issued. It is the mighty instrument of franchisement, which delivers one half the world from the thraldom in which it was held by the other—for not the present generation alone, but the innumerable unborn millions who will yet fill this immense hemisphere, are destined to enjoy its incalculable benefits. From the date of this glorious charter, has commenced a change not for us only, but for the human race, which will elevate the humble and the lowly of every clime from the contempt and degradation in which they have been held by the powerful and the proud. The sentiments of liberality promulgated in this document, will go forth like axioms, and form the political faith that shall regulate the movements of the mightiest nations. “All men are born equal,” is a truth before the prevalence of which the pretensions of kings and nobles to exclusive privileges and immunities in the social system, will disperse as the shadow flies before the beams of the sun. The right of the people to self-government, and their capacity to exercise it properly and to their own advantage, will become recognised as an article of belief which it will be thought absurdity to controvert. In short, mankind shall so deeply venerate this declaration, that it will become the text-book of freedom, the manual of patriotism to all generations. “What are its effects on yourselves, since ye have heard the elevating spirit of its sentiments, its bold announcement of your emancipation? Are you not exalted in your own estimation? Do you not feel as if chains had fallen from your limbs? Do you not, inspired with the dignity of freemen, almost imagine that you breathe the air more freely, and move with greater elasticity? The humility and timidity of serfs have departed from your spirits. But yesterday you felt as if your patriotism were treason—to-day you feel that it is allegiance—allegiance to the country of your birth, to the government of your choice, and not to an oppressor in a distant quarter of the globe, with whom you can have no common interest, and who, for you, can have no fellow feeling. “Of the soil on which ye tread, ye are now the paramount lords. Before the date of this instrument you held it but in subjection to a stranger whose counsellors have latterly assumed the right to exact from you the fruits of your industry without your consent. Your resistance to this injustice was called treason. But traitors you cannot now be, for, thanks to this document, you are no longer subjects to the foe. You are citizens, free and independent lords of a soil that owns no foreign master.—You are, it is true, weak in comparison to your foe. So is the eagle in comparison to the lion, yet it has a spirit equally daring, and in the independence of its nature, acknowledges subjection to no earthly lord. O! my countrymen, may the King of kings, who is now your only sovereign, render you worthy of your new-born rights, and enable you to struggle successfully with the terrible storms you shall have to encounter, in defending them. Shrink not in the hour of peril, ye who are now the fathers of a nation! The morning of your existence is tempestuous and dark; but it will usher in a day of glorious tranquillity, when the fruits of your labours shall diffuse joy over a grateful land, and the blessings of millions shall crown your memories with immortality.” This address made a deep impression on its auditors—the true patriots became more zealous, the wavering became firm, and many who had hitherto been opposed to the cause of liberty from the dread of committing treason, now conceiving themselves freed from their allegiance to royalty, unhesitatingly declared their adhesion to the patriotic side. Still, however, there were numbers whose attachment to the ancient order of things, rendered them hostile to the great measure now adopted. Many of these had favoured the resistance to British usurpation, but had never desired a separation from British connexion or release from British authority. The hardened and resolved tories were strengthened by the accession of such; and the bold and irretraceable step which the whigs had now taken, aroused their animosity to an implacable degree, and they became more zealous and active than ever in the warfare which they waged against the friends of liberty. The whole heart and soul of John Butler were secretly with these. Their leaders knew it, and placed entire confidence in him. With all their machinations and designs he was made acquainted; and frequently, by his advice and management, he contributed to E 2 the success of their enterprises. He, however, in public preserved an appearance of attachment to the popular cause. This he did with the double view of serving his own party the more effectually by treachery to the other, and of availing himself of any favourable occurrence that might take place to aggrandize himself by means of the whigs, in which, had he succeeded, it is doubtful whether his principles might not have accommodated themselves to his interest. Be this as it may, he, for some months, conducted himself so much to the satisfaction of the people of Wyoming, that their most vigilant patriots found no cause to make him an object of either disapprobation or suspicion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. Since we must part,—before this holy shrine, And in the presence of the Power Divine, Our heart's sincerity our lips shall prove, And swear unchanging faithfulness in love. We'll join our fates in one for ever now, Bound and betrothed by an eternal vow! Harley. The promulgation of the Declaration of Independence, although a bold, was an extremely prudent and well-timed measure. Without its encouraging tendencies, the numerous disasters which befell the American arms during the subsequent five or six months, must have occasioned the most resolute friends of the popular cause to give it up in despair. After the loss of the great battle of Long Island, a series of defeats reduced the combatants for freedom to the mere skeleton of an ill-supplied and much-suffering army, harassed and pursued from place to place, by a victorious, numerous, and well-appointed foe. This was that period of desponding prospects which is emphatically said to have tried men's souls. The most sanguine began to despond, and in thebosoms of the timid, hope was extinguished. The noblest cause for which a people ever fought, depended entirely on the firmness and management of one man, aided by only the remnant of an army of harassed, wearied and worn-out fugitives, so ill-appointed that they had not clothing sufficient to defend them from the severity of an inclement winter. But that man was Washington, and those fugitives were THE HEROES OF SEVENTY-SIX, who soon became the conquerors of Trenton and Princeton, and snatched, by their hardy valour, the cause of their country—the cause of man—from the brink of ruin. Even after these brilliant achievements had shed their cheering influence over the cause, the horizon became again darkened by the disasters of Brandywine and Germantown, and the country's necessities called aloud to her sons for sympathy and succour. By none was the call more keenly felt than by Henry Austin; and his ardour at length received the sanction of his father. This ardour was participated by many of the patriotic youth of the settlement; and he was enabled to collect a generous band of about fifty volunteers, who enrolled themselves beneath his command for the purpose of joining the army under Washington. As the day of his departure drew near, his patriotism had to contend with the force of a powerful passion which swayed his bosom as strongly as ever it swayed the bosom of man. This passion was love— love for Agnes Norwood, whose image had become, from the first moment he beheld her, entwined with his very existence. Day and night was she the subject of his meditations.— Her charms were the delicious food of his imagination; and he felt as if he could live no where, with satisfaction, but in her presence. And she had long since acknowledged a mutual love. Many and sweet were the hours of romantic fervour they had passed together since that acknowledgment took place. Their attachment was sanctioned by their parents. Henry appeared to Mr. Norwood just such a husband as he could wish for his daughter, and Mr. Austin rejoiced in the happy fortune which had gained for his son the affections of a female so fair and so worthy as Agnes Norwood. For one reason in particular, he rejoiced in the circumstance. He hoped that her charms would have sufficient influence to retain him at home, and check his patriotic eagerness to embark in the dangers of war. And, indeed, these charms had been sufficient for this purpose, until Henry heard of the depth of his country's misfortunes, and the encreasing gloom which, after the battle of Germantown, overshadowed her cause. His sense of duty then came in aid of his patriotism, and he resolved to make a mighty effort to break the fascinations of love and the enjoyments of home, in order to serve a cause in the success of which he felt so strongly interested. Yet so powerful was his passion, that after he had procured his father's consent to join the army, and had even organized his band of followers, his heart almost failed him, and he became irresolute in his determination to leave, even but for a season, the dear object of his soul's desire. While under the influence of this feeling he visited her. He found her in her father's parlour. “I come, my Agnes,” said he, “to state that your fascinations have conquered. Love has prevailed.—Patriotism, duty, desire of glory—all, all have yielded to my dread of separating from thee. I have decided to remain with thee. I feel I have done wrong: but, O! for charms like thine, who would not relinquish every thing? If my feelings were known, the severest would forgive my error.” “Henry,” said she, “what do I hear!— Wilt thou refuse thy arm to thy country in her distress?—But, perhaps, thou art right: we may be happy here, although liberty should be driven from the land!” “What! Agnes,” he exclaimed, as if her tone, rather than her words, had caused a forgotten feeling to startle his mind, “what sayest thou? Could we be happy as slaves?” “Yes; with love like ours, even in slavery we might be happy! But, Henry, self-abasement, such a mind as thine could not endure.” “Self-abasement! Agnes? What abasement is there in preferring thy love to all things? In preferring thy society to that of soldiers; thy beauteous presence in this valley, to the clamours of a camp?” “It is preferring the indulgence of selfish wishes, to the performance of duty. Henry, canst thou not see how that would produce self-abasement?” “True, Agnes! I see it.” “Couldst thou endure the torments of such a degraded feeling?” “No, Agnes! I fear not easily. But thy smiles would be my recompense, my relief, my unfailing comfort.” “But could I smile if thou wert unhappy? Or could I comfort thee, if thou hadst lost thy own esteem?” “Ah! I feel thy words, my beloved! Thou art the angel of my protection.—My own esteem!—I shall not lose it. I will do my duty. Assist me, Agnes! strengthen me with thy counsel. Enable me to leave thee for a time, that I may fly to the post of duty, and be worthy of thy love.” “When thou shalt do so, Henry, I will esteem thee—nay, if possible, I will love thee more than now!” He caught her hands rapturously. “Thanks to thee, my only love!” he said, “thou hast saved me from my weakness. Thou shalt esteem, as well as love me. My country needs me. I will do my duty!” “Although our separation, Henry, should break my heart, I would not be the means of detaining thee from thy duty. Thy departure to the busy world where thou mayest forget me, or to scenes of danger where thou mayest be slain—O! Henry, such thoughts distract me.—Yet—yet, thou must go—thy country calls, and what is my happiness, or even thine, that we should indulge it at her expense?” “Agnes, I could worship thee for such sentiments. I will leave thee for my country's sake. Heaven will protect thee in my absence in recompense of thy virtue.—And I too shall win favour from above for the severe sacrifice I now make in obedience to the calls of duty.— But forget thee, didst thou say? No, not for a moment, Agnes, shall thy image be absent from my recollection—thy loveliness from my heart. But, my beloved, can we not unite before my departure? Methinks, I could go with less sorrow and reluctance, could I call thee my own?” “Henry, dost thou allude to marriage?— We are both young—too young, perhaps.—But let our fathers decide.—Return here at six this evening. I will reflect on the subject. I will consult my father. Do thou consult thine.” Henry's father did not approve of his son's marriage under present circumstances. “I confess,” he said, “that Miss Norwood is in all respects worthy of you. Your having placed your affections on her affords me great satisfaction. But you are now going on a toilsome and dangerous pursuit. I should wish you to go single and untrammelled with domestic cares, so that your new profession may receive your whole devotion, by which means you will be more likely to command success. But should disaster happen to you; should you be wounded or slain, (casualties which, I trust, Heaven will avert,) it will be enough that I and my family be made miserable. Why expose another family to the same hazard of sorrow, by needlessly connecting yourself with it in marriage? Should you marry, you do not propose remaining at home to enjoy your wife's society. You would make her your wife to F abandon her after the ceremony, and expose her to the risk of becoming an early widow. Is this love, or is it selfishness? But you say, you wish only to secure her fidelity? Has she not owned her attachment, and promised constancy in return for your's? And do you doubt her truth? You cannot. It would be a feeling unworthy of the lover of Miss Norwood.” Henry was struck with his father's observations. He felt that it would be sweet to call Agnes his own. But it would be unjust to expose her as his wife to the distress of any accident that might befall him in the war. True, she loved him, and were he unfortunately to fall, even though unmarried to him, she would grieve with a sincere and deep sorrow. But would not that sorrow sooner end in the maid than in the wife? At all events, he would not at the present, urge the marriage, since his father disapproved of it, unless Mr. Norwood's opinion should be more favourable towards it, which he did not venture to expect. Henry judged rightly of Mr. Norwood's opinion. That gentleman, anxiously alive for his daughter's welfare, thought that her marriage with so young a man on the eve of his departure from the settlement, and on a hazardous pursuit, would be extremely imprudent. “Let a few years roll on,” said he to Agnes. “This tempestuous period will pass by, and happier times may bless the land with peace and freedom and prosperity. Henry and you, my daughter, will be still young enough to engage in the cares of the marriage state, and I shall then be happy in joining your hands and giving you my blessing.” To her father's opinion Agnes bowed implicitly. In all that concerned herself, his opinion was her creed, his will was her law. When Henry according to appointment visited her that evening, she stated to him the objections made by her father to their marriage under present circumstances. He saw them in their full force, and he admitted them, and forbore to press his suit for immediate happiness; although, when he beheld her loveliness in all its blooming graces before him, he internally deplored the untoward circumstances that withheld him, for a time, from the possession of such charms. That evening, towards twilight, the lovers walked out together along the banks of the Sharon. It was the eve of Henry's departure. His company of volunteers were assembled in the village, in readiness to march the next morning. Had his marriage, therefore, taken place, short, indeed, must have been his stay with his bride. This consideration, in some measure, reconciled him to the disappointment. “Oh Agnes,” said he, “I was certainly too inconsiderate in the wishes I expressed, for if thou wert made my own, I feel that I could not leave thee, and my duty should be neglected.” “Indeed,” she replied, “I am persuaded that the postponement of our nuptials, is both prudent and proper. If Providence shall hear my constant prayers, and restore thee to thy friends in more propitious times, our union will then have the sanction of our parents, and the joy of that hour will not be blighted by the grief of separation.” They had now reached the entrance of the village church. They observed the door partly open. They concluded that it had been left so by the negligence of some person employed in making repairs inside. They entered the holy place. All was still and silent as the interior of the graves that surrounded it. Who has ever visited a temple of the Divinity, built with hands, when devoid of worshippers, without being impressed with a sensation of the awful solemnity that pervades the sacred edifice. It is a feeling as if we were in the immediate presence of the Supreme of all things, surrounded by his ministering angels—for we imagine, or, at least have sensations skin to the imagination, that such a place can never be unoccupied; and since human worshippers are absent, their place must be filled and their functions performed, by invisible intelligences of a higher and more holy order. The lovers felt, that if they were not surrounded by such intelligences, they were altogether without witnesses of their fervent expressions of mutual fondness and never-ending constancy. “Oh! my beloved,” said Henry, “it is not any fickleness of thy mind I dread; for I believe that thou art all truth and sincerity. But events may occur in my absence severely to try thy faith. Forgive me, therefore, if I wish it secured by some solemn vow. Become my betrothed—plight thyself to me within this solemn shrine of God, and before that holy place from whence thy father's lips have so often poured forth pious instruction, and promulgated the obligations of our holy faith. In the name of love, and for the sake of my peace of mind when I shall be afar off, let me entreat thee, to kneel with me in this sacred temple, where it may be long before we again meet, and, in the awful presence of Him to whom the place is consecrated, let us pledge to each other unwavering faith, and eternal love—let us swear F 2 that in wedlock neither of us shall ever pledge our vows to any other.” They knelt, they caught each other's right hands, and before God and his angels, they swore the oath of betrothment, and sealed it with a fervent kiss. That moment a voice suddenly but sweetly said, “Heaven has registered that vow. Oh! ye Betrothed! let it never be broken!” The lovers started to their feet in confusion; but conscious of no sin, they felt no alarm. They looked round, and beheld standing behind them the “Hermit of the Woods.” “Pardon my intrusion,” said he, “it was not intentional. The door was open. I entered. I approached too near before I perceived you, to withdraw without disturbing you. I, therefore, remained silent till your vows were passed, when I thought it better to discover myself than run the hazard of being discovered by you. I have long known your loves.—I have now witnessed your betrothment—but fear nothing. I am your friend, and your secret is safe.” “Good Rodolph,” said Henry, “we know you are our friend—we have effectually experienced your friendship. What you have seen and heard, you were sent by Heaven to witness. We, therefore, murmur not at your presence. But in this holy place and sanctified moment, we crave thy blessing.” “May the great Being who rules above, and who is worshipped here, bless you, my children. May he watch over you when far asunder, and in other days bring you together, that you may redeem the vows you have pledged this evening, and under happy auspices, fulfil your Betrothment!” He said and departed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. Heaven first taught letters for some wretch's aid, Some banished lover, or some captive maid; They live, they speak, they breathe what love inspires, Warm from the soul, and faithful to its fires. The virgin's wish without her fears impart, Excuse the blush and pour forth all the heart, Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul, And waft a sigh from Indus to the Pole. Pope. Whoever has witnessed the departure from a small village, upon a distant enterprise of importance and danger, of a band of soldiers endeared to the inhabitants by long residence and ties of affinity, must have been moved by the many spontaneous effusions of sincere affection; the tears, the embraces, the tender exhortations, the blessings, and the heart-warm prayers for the protection of Heaven, which are fervently reciprocated by friends, relatives and lovers, now parting, many of them to meet no more. This is the revealing hour of attachment. Emotions of love which were hitherto concealed, now break forth, and show themselves freely, though, perhaps timidly, before the face of day. A degree of license is permitted to the public outpourings of the heart on such occasions, which on others would be considered unseemly or indecorous. It is not the parting embraces and sorrows of parents and children, or sisters and brothers, that are now alone tolerated by the sympathizing feelings of the public; the bursting forth of the grief of young and bashful lovers is viewed as neither misplaced nor unbecoming. The hearts of all are softened, and enter fully into the pathetic spirit of the scene; and partake so much of its tenderness as to comprehend and value the kindly influence from which it flows. Such a scene, in all its variety of feelings, and intensity of emotions, was, much to his chagrin, witnessed by John Butler, the royalist, on the day that Henry Austin and his brave band of patriotic volunteers, departed from Wyoming to join the encampment at Valley Forge. Yet Butler rejoiced at the departure of these men. It removed to a distance many of his enemies, and diminished the strength of the whig interest in the settlement. He was only chagrined to see how much they were beloved; and if a wish of his could have annihilated these patriotic soldiers and those who lavished on them their parting caresses, that wish would have gone forth with the joyous energy of malignant triumph. He still wore the cloak of patriotism; but the time had come when he gave up the intention of wearing it much longer. He had tried popularity for many months, but it had gained him no confidence; it had procured him no public trust, no official emolument. He now saw reasons for permitting the current of his affections to revert into their former channel. It reverted, however, secretly. It did not yet suit his views to change his outward professions or his observable conduct. Hypocrisy was, for some time yet, his surest game, and he played it admirably. The leaders of the people were deceived. It was, therefore, easy to dupe the people themselves. But he deceived them no longer for office. That object he saw was hopeless. He deceived them for his own safety and their ruin. At this period, many families fled from the populous districts that were the seats of the war, to seek repose and safety in more remote settlements. The settlement of Wyoming offered abundant attractions to these. Accordingly, both whigs and tories flocked there in considerable numbers. But of these newcomers, the tories were by far the most numerous. Their continuance in the war-haunted districts where their opponents had obtained all authority, was neither pleasant nor safe. It is true, the authorities, as well as the majority of the people of Wyoming, opposed them in politics, and disliked their turbulence. But they were a people generous and hospitable, and many of them connected with the fugitives, or as they were more courteously termed, the refugees, by the ties of relationship. The latter, therefore, by the most solemn pledges of peaceable intentions, gained the good will, and secured the protection of the deceived and kindhearted inhabitants of the district, who believed that they had admitted among them men who sincerely regretted their past errors, and were resolved by their future conduct, to atone for them. A few were sincere, and remained faithful to their pledge; but fear alone induced the majority to feign a repentance which they did not feel. Their feelings and opinions were not changed. But the deceived people could not see the heart. They believed the professions which they heard, and gave credit for the decorum they beheld. That which was produced by expediency, they mistook for the result of conviction. The traitors were forgiven, received as friends, and treated with affection by the virtuous and unsuspecting people of Wyoming, whom they waited only for a fitting opportunity to destroy. Many even of the latter character would, no doubt, have remained tranquil, and perhaps gradually abandoned their unpatriotic and dangerous sentiments, but for the machinations of Butler, who, like the evil genius of the place, would permit neither tranquillity, confidence, nor amity to remain long therein. War and destruction were the elements in which he delighted to move. To enjoy the revelry of bloodshed, he scrupled not to sacrifice both the obligations of kindred and the ties of gratitude. He had in his advances to popularity, among the whigs, met with repulses sufficient to convince him of the fruitlessness of pursuing aggrandizement in that direction. The encreasing numbers of the refugee tories that now sought safety in the settlement, and looked up to him as their head, induced him secretly to abandon all desire of connexion with the whigs, and to throw himself entirely into the arms of the party to which, from feeling and habit, he had long been attached. Since the departure of Henry Austin, he had made several overtures to Miss Norwood. She had been long acquainted with his passion for her. Master of duplicity as he was, he had not even been able entirely to prevent Henry from suspecting it. But Henry had never breathed his suspicion to Agnes, nor she hers to him. He felt too confident of the firmness with which he was rooted in her affection, to fear being supplanted by Butler or any other rival; and he had the delicacy not to hurt her feelings by alluding to the possibility of such an occurrence. Butler's engagement with his sister he had long wished to see dissolved; for he now knew enough of the man to be assured that he was not calculated to make her happy. His surmise that his affections were transferred to Agnes, led him to hope that the intended union of such a man with so near and dear a relative as his sister, never would take place. Yet he grieved for the affliction which the disappointment would bring upon Isabella. She had unfortunately fixed her affections upon an unworthy object, and was, therefore, doomed to the misery of a sorrowing heart, whether she became united to him or not. In the one case, however, the sorrow might be transitory —the hand of time and the force of reflection would at least weaken, if they did not entirely obliterate its impression.—In the other, there could be no hope of this. An indissoluble bond would unite her destiny to that of a villain, and permanent wretchedness could not but ensue. On his sister's account, therefore, the change in the affections of Butler afforded Henry satisfaction sufficient to atone for any uneasiness he might feel on account of Agnes being the object of the new flame of the deceitful royalist. In the fidelity of Agnes to himself he had full confidence. The rivalship G of Butler he therefore treated with contempt; and he left Wyoming without giving him to understand, by any indication whatever, that he suspected its existence. When at a distance, however, from the object of his love, he soon began to have unpleasant feelings on the subject. He recollected that in his absence, Butler might have the boldness to make an express declaration of his passion; and although it was impossible that Agnes could be induced to encourage his pretensions, she might be subjected to his importunities, and even—but it was an idea he wished not to entertain—in the event of disturbance in the settlement, to his violence. In his correspondence with her—for he found frequent opportunities of forwarding letters to his friends—he never alluded to his fear on this subject, lest he might give her unnecessary uneasiness. But to Dr. Watson he poured them forth without reserve. “There is one great cause of uneasiness under which I suffer,” said he, in a letter to the Doctor, written in the spring of 1778, “that I have as yet communicated to no one. For some months before I left Wyoming, I was haunted with a suspicion that Butler loved Agnes. It is needless to detail the circumstances that gave birth to that suspicion. I shall only say that they were numerous and forcible. You are aware of his engagements with my sister. Because I had a bad opinion of the man, any thing that inspired a hope that those engagements would not be fulfilled, afforded me pleasure. His passion for Agnes did not much alarm me, while I was in her vicinity. I knew that she would be faithful to me, and I feared not his rivalship. Neither did I then fear that she would be subjected to any inconveniences from his importunities, or danger from his violence. The one she would repel, and the other he dared not attempt. The circumstances of the parties and the affairs of the settlement sanctioned this conclusion. She was under the protection of her father, of her lover, of her friends, of the whole population of the village, by whom she was beloved—while he—a refugee without power, without influence, without character, could not without ruin to himself, attempt any thing against her peace. “But, my friend, I am now separated from her by an extensive and almost pathless wilderness. I know not what may be the posture of public affairs at Wyoming. The savages are your neighbours, and they are far from being friendly to our cause; and tories are numerous even in the midst of your population.—I cannot forget that Butler was a tory; nay, I have good grounds for believing he is still one in his heart. Should any interruption of your tranquillity take place, I tremble to think of what may be his conduct. He hates my sister. Might he not avail himself of some Indian irruption to destroy her—to destroy perhaps my aged parent?—And then his passion for Agnes—might he not employ the marauders to bear her off to some distant concealment, where she would be completely in his power? “It is the possibility of evils like these that cause my uneasiness. Will you say that my apprehensions are fanciful? Heaven grant that they may be so! But incidents have come to my knowledge, that impart to them a greater strength than they could ever derive from mere fancy. Has Butler been absent of late, for any length of time, from your village? If he has, there is treachery on foot; and my fears are not without foundation. Let all his movements be watched with the closest vigilance, and you may possibly detect and frustrate his designs. Hear the reasons for my alarm, and the cautions I give you. I suspect he has been, within these few weeks, in Philadelphia, arranging with General Howe the plan of some military movement, doubtless on the frontiers. One of my corps, who is now a prisoner in the city, has found means to inform me, that he is persuaded he saw this restless and deceitful man, in a disguised habit, at General Howe's quarters. What should he be doing there, if he is, as he professes, our friend? And why disguised, unless engaged in some treacherous design, which he fears may be discovered by some of our friends in the city. But he may, I admit, be wrongfully accused. My informant may have been mistaken in his identity. You will, on the spot, be best able to judge. I would not have him accused if he is innocent. It would be impolitic, as well as unjust. It would excite his revenge and arm his adherents against us. He is now, perhaps, at least neutral; and it is better to keep him so than arouse against our cause one so capable of doing mischief. “I do not know whether it would be proper to acquaint Agnes with my fears. It would alarm her, perhaps needlessly. Your discretion will decide this point. Alas! my friend, if I were to describe the full extent of my gloomy forebodings, you would imagine that I had lost all moral courage, and become totally unfit for the duties of a soldier. Yet it is not so. The contrariety of my feelings is, indeed, strange, but not unaccountable. I feel that I am not a coward, and yet I am a prey to intense G 2 fears of a certain description. I could with alacrity go out, at any moment, to meet the enemy in battle array. It is not for myself I fear. It is for one dearer than myself. Oh, if you have ever felt the power of an absorbing love like mine, you will be able to understand my feelings; to account for my inconsistency—perhaps you will call it my weakness. Yet be assured that this passion, potent as it is, is still kept in subserviency to my duty. My duty requires me to be here to act against the enemies of my country; but my affections are in Wyoming, wound round the form of the loveliest and sweetest of earthly beings.—But I become rhapsodical, forgetting that you may not be lover enough to relish my flights of romantic passion. I will conclude by imploring you to watch over the safety of my Betrothed, and to be alive to the information I have given you in relation to Butler.” The following letter Henry forwarded at the same time with the foregoing, to Agnes: “My dearest love—You can scarcely imagine the gratification which an opportunity of writing to you affords me. The most rapturous moments of my existence have been spent in pouring forth in your presence, the language of love that told the emotions of my heart; and in listening to the sweet tone of approval with which you answered me. We are now far asunder—more than a hundred miles of an almost impenetrable forest separate us. Yet do I pant as strongly as ever for that sweet communion of souls, that interchange of devoted affections once so ardently expressed by every look and every tone which then rendered us so happy. Yes, in such moments my bliss was great, and but for the sake of my suffering country, I never should have withdrawn from the endeared scenes where I enjoyed it. Reflecting upon them, and meditating on your perfections, are substitutes for those happy moments which I often enjoy. But writing to you is still a more rapturous employment. An opportunity for it occurs more rarely than for meditation, and it approaches in its nature more nearly to conversation. It imparts the pleasing feeling that the sentiments I commit to the paper shall be conveyed to you; that you will ponder on them; that they will be cherished by you, and that you will derive from them a gratification similar to what I experienced in writing them. Such are the enjoyments of letterwriting to separated lovers. Oh! my Betrothed! for my sake indulge in it frequently, that I may frequently behold the words which your own hand wrote, the sentiments which your own heart conceived, and the assurances which shall speak the unwavering fidelity of thy affection. Do not mistake me. I doubt not thy affection, my Agnes. I would as soon doubt the existence of the sun on which I daily gaze. Yet I would beg from you frequent assurances of thy love, because of the delight they afford me. Oh! with what luxury could I dwell on the dear lines that should contain those assurances. Save hearing thy lips pronounce them, earth could afford no enjoyment so sweet. “Let then thy letters convey to me that which thou knowest will be my best solace for thy absence—the assurance of thy welfare, and the whole fervour of thy love. Without reserve —Oh! Agnes! without reserve, surely, thou wilt express all the ardour of thy affection, all the devotedness of thy heart—all thy fondness, and all thy wishes for me. I am, my love, covetous of every thought that passes through thy mind. I would not have the slightest emotion of thy soul unknown to me; nor would I conceal from thee the least sensation of mine. Would to Heaven that separated lovers had some more perfect and expeditious means of interchanging sentiments and feelings, than by letters. Then should we, even at this distance, be made happy by the intermingling of thoughts and sensations. I should then less regret the necessity which keeps us asunder; and endure with more patience, the absence from thee to which I am doomed. “Yes, Agnes, attached as I am to the righteous cause in which I am embarked, I acknowledge I suffer much from my impatient desires again to be with thee—to hearken to the tones of thy sweet voice—to gaze upon thy beauty— thy unrivalled beauty! Agnes, at this moment, thy picture is placed before me—thy bright eyes so full of fondness—thy sweet lips surrounded with smiles—the innumerable, nameless, and matchless charms of thy whole countenance! `Ah!' I may well exclaim, `among the daughters of men who is like unto thee, my beloved!' No wonder my fancy is inflamed, andmy heart enraptured, when I meditate on thee. And art thou to be my own! Hast thou sworn it, my betrothed? Shall I yet be the master of such boundless happiness —such intoxicating charms? My soul is kindled with the idea. My imagination flies to the haunts of Wyoming. I embrace thee—I am happy—thou art my all—the world, and all its interests, ties and connexions are forgotten. What are they to me when thou art mine! This is the potency of love which I delight to obey! Oh! Agnes! that such a reverie might last for ever!—that no wordly interruption should remind me that my joys are but visionary —that no trumpet's sound, nor sentinel's gun, should disperse the dear illusion, and tell me that I am in the midst of a camp, enchained there by a soldier's and a patriot's duty, whilst thou art far distant amidst sylvan wilds on the frontiers of civilization! “But I will have fortitude—I will endure our separation on account of my country, until she shall no longer need my service. Thou wilt love me the more for the sacrifice. Oh! write to me that thou wilt. It will strengthen my resolution; and from the exhortations of love I shall draw inducements to patriotism, and acquire a spirit of perseverance in duty, which will in the end afford me matter of self-satisfaction and joy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. I know that there are angry spirits And turbulent mutterers of stifled treason, Who lurk in narrow places, and walk out Muffled to whisper curses to the night; Disbanded soldiers, discontended rufflans, And desperate libertines who brawl in taverns. Byron. Several weeks after writing the foregoing letters, Henry received the following from Dr. Watson.— “Your information concerning Butler was well-timed. It aroused our vigilance and led to the detection of his villany. A deep and nefarious conspiracy was formed against our settlement, in which hundreds of our tory neighbours were implicated. Many of them, among whom is Butler, have fled, and some are in prison. The latter, it is believed, for better security, will be sent to Reading. The bearer of this, carries despatches from our council to your General, detailing our present perilous condition, and requesting succour, which, I trust, we shall receive in time for our protection. “On receiving your letter, my first impulse was to lay it before our council. But as you had expressed yourself doubtfully in relation to the guilt of Butler, and seemed desirous that I should watch rather than accuse him, I resolved to do so, for I felt unwilling to involve into a trouble a man who might eventually be innocent. There is an individual in our settlement in whom I have long placed a greater degree of confidence than is known to any one besides ourselves. I have entrusted him with secrets which I never entrusted to another, and have, in consequence, derived from him consolation none else could afford. This man is of wandering habits; but wise, intelligent and venerable. He is respected by all the people throughout the settlements. Even the Indians, whom he often visits, and with whose language he is familiar, esteem him much, and on affairs of intricacy consult him often. You will by this time have perceived that I mean Rodolph, the Hermit of the Woods. “Rodolph had himself observed some movements among the tories, and especially among the New England refugees, over whom Butler possesses great influence. Many of them had lately visited the Mohawk Indians, a tribe with which Rodolph is well acquainted. They, in consequence, as he supposes, have held public councils, and seem to be preparing for some enterprise. But the circumstance most convincing of Butler being connected with these movements, is his having been absent for nearly four weeks, about the time when you state that he was suspected to be in Philadelphia. We concluded, therefore, that your friend was under no mistake respecting him; and we looked upon him not only as connected with the treason which you suspected, but as the arch-traitor and chief contriver of the whole. “Still we kept our suspicions from the public ear. No one had as yet done any thing to warrant his arrest; and by remaining in a state of apparent security and indifference, we might tempt the conspirators into some indiscretion which would enable us to discover and baffle their designs. “Rodolph's political sentiments are not very generally known. Until the agitations of the times began to embroil the affairs of this disstrict, he, perhaps, felt but little interest in them; and, although he wandered much among the valleys, he was never very communicative with the inhabitants. His manners are reserved, mild, and meditative, and obnoxious to no party. The whiggish inclination of his opinions, therefore, is known to only a few of his select friends. The tories know nothing of them. On perusing your letter, he availed himself of this circumstance to deceive them for the public good. He resolves to act H the dangerous part of a spy on their conduct, for which purpose he feigned an approbation of their sentiments, and a preference for their cause. “By this means he became acquainted with the intrigues that were now actively going forward among the refugees, and soon discovered that the principal mover was Butler. I now determined to put our rulers on their guard. I had no longer any cause for hesitation. He whom I should accuse, I could prove to be guilty. Still there was an obstacle in the way. The near kinsman of the traitor, you know, is at the head of our local government. He is a worthy man, and one in whom the whigs justly repose confidence. He had been hospitable and kind to his deceitful relative, and had taken him under his protection, in the conviction of his conversion to the cause of the country being sincere. To inform such a man that his cousin and protogee was a traitor, would, to say the least of it, be to inflict a pang of no ordinary kind upon his feelings.— And would not the governor's friendship for the accused naturally cause him to hesitate giving credence to the accusation? I feared not the latter. I had confidence in the governor's patriotism and integrity, and I had proofs sufficient to produce conviction on his mind. As for giving him pain, that was too trifling a consideration not to fade away before the importance of the revelations I was to make. I therefore hastened to him. I made the revelations. He was astonished; for the professions of his kinsman had completely deceived him. He was grieved; for he had cherished an affection for the traitor, and was also on terms of intimacy with many others involved in the treason. “Rodolph had discovered that an assemblage of the tories was to take place in a few days in an obscure valley, called the Hemlock Glade, some miles to the westward of our village. Several of the leading whigs were immediately summoned to the governor's house. The particulars of the information were laid before them, and their opinions asked as to the measures it would be most advisable to pursue. After some deliberation, it was agreed that the information should be kept secret, lest alarm might be given to the tories, and their assembling prevented—for, it was considered, that the act of their assembling would be such manifest proof of their treasonable designs, as would reconcile their best friends to the necessity and justice of their punishment. In the mean time it was proposed that an armed force, sufficient to overpower them, should be collected as secretly as possible, by which their meeting might be surprised, themselves carried to prison, and all their machinations frustrated and their power of doing mischief destroyed at one blow. This plan had also another essential advantage. It would furnish sufficient evidence of the guilt of the culprits, without obliging the authorities to expose the individual from whom the information originated. Such exposure was, if possible, to be avoided, as it would incapacitate him from afterwards serving the patriotic cause in the character of a spy.” Thus far the epistle of Dr. Watson has answered the purpose of our narrative. The remainder having by some accident been destroyed, the story must proceed without its aid. By industrious research the writer has obtained a sufficient acquaintance with the facts, to be able to relate them accurately enough without the aid of any written document. The measures mentioned by the Doctor having been agreed to, a young and spirited officer of the militia of the district, named Dennison, undertook to have a sufficient armed force in readiness for the service. In the valley appointed for the meeting of the tories, there was a small log house belonging to one of their faction. About noon, on the appointed day, around this rustic building, the conspirators began to assemble, and until about two o'clock continued to increase in number, without proceeding to business. Butler, Brandt, and Aranooko, the Sachem of the Mohawks, were early on the scene. In conformity with the custom of modern and fashionable historians, we shall stop the progress of the story for a short time, in order to give a brief sketch of these three distinguished personages. Though this may communicate no important information, it may satisfy the curiosity of the reader, and, if so, will not be writing in vain. Butler possessed a good figure; and, in his pleasant moods, a handsome countenance. But in his moments of gloom and resentment he betrayed the looks of a ruffian, and in his periods of wrath the scowl of a demon. On such occasions the contracted brows, the flushed cheeks, the clenched teeth, the quivering lips, and the eyes flashing fire like burning mirrors, denoted the hellish fury of his mind, and if he did not become loathsome, he became terrifying. But his most furious fits could be controlled by his hypocrisy where his interest required it. A moment's reflection would replace him on his guard, and restore to him a placidity yet an expressiveness of countenance, which at once indicated great knowledge of the world, and ability to deceive it.—But having spoken H 2 of his appearance and character in a preceding part of our narrative, it is unncessary to enlarge upon it here. The ferocity of Brandt, his courage, his activity and robust strength, are well known to the readers of history, which has abundantly exposed to an indignant world, the sanguinary and vengeful disposition of this most daring of savages. His hatred of the whites is said to have been of a more embittered character than was usual even among the Indians. This is the more remarkable, as he himself was but a half-Indian, his father having been a white man, of German descent, who on occasion of some disgust which he had imbibed against civilized society, took up his residence among the Indians. The collisions with the frontier settlers into which the restless and enterprising disposition of Brandt had frequently brought him, and in which he had met with many repulses, no doubt tended much to irritate his feelings, and arouse that animosity against the whites which was the reigning passion of his soul. The Sachem, Aranooko, was an Indian of a dignified figure, somewhat advanced in years, but still athletic and healthful. He was actuated with all the antipathy natural to the aborigines against the despoilers of their race; yet he was averse to useless and wanton warfare upon them. He was unlike Brandt in the circumstance, that the destruction of white men of itself, unattended with any advantage to the Indian cause, afforded him no pleasure. At least, like a prudent father of his people, he was unwilling to plunge them into the horrors of war, when it afforded no prospect of a successful issue, merely from vengeful motives. He possessed neither the unbounded ferocity nor reckless hardihood of Brandt—yet he was greatly under the influence of that mongrel savage; and it was chiefly by his persuasions that he had been induced to join the present confederacy against the inhabitants of Wyoming.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. A fairer person lost not heaven; he seemed For dignity composed, and high exploit: But all was false and hollow; though his tongue Dropt manna, and would make the worse appear The better reason. Milton. Brandt and Aranooka sat on a bench in the chief apartment of the log-cottage already mentioned, waiting with dignified gravity, and in meditative silence, the full assemblage of the tories, whose number was every moment increasing by fresh accessions from various parts of the district. Five or six other savages sat near them. The two chiefs were drest in a very showy and rather imposing costume. Their vestments of scarlet flannel, wide in the sleeves, and tied closely round the body, were ornamented in front, by an intertexture of porcupine's quills and the down of various coloured birds, wrought into curious devices. These, together with their leggings of deer skin—their mockasins of buffalo hide—and, above all, their head dresses adorned with feathers of the flamingo and the eagle, presented to the eye a wild but rich and picturesque appearance. The dignified composure of these rude sons of the forest was well contrasted with the noisy restlessness of the tories who filled the apartment, and were often disputatious and clamorous, and sometimes even indecorous in their conversation and conduct. Ardent spirits, furnished for payment by the owner of the cabin, were used freely by the whites. But Aranooko and his companions refused to taste any until the business for which they had met, should be transacted. Such was the state of matters within doors, before the hour appointed for the transaction of business arrived. Without, a promiscuous assemblage of several hundred men, indulged themselves in military exercises, or in discussing the merits and prospects of their enterprise, or in feats of strength and other amusements, as whim or inclination suggested. At length, twelve o'clock being announced, Butler mounted on an elevated platform outside the door, and requested the attention of the assembly, which he addressed as follows:— “Friends and fellow subjects, I now beg leave to state the object of calling you together on the present occasion. But first let me observe, that I hope there is no one here who is not truly and zealously faithful to the cause in which we are embarked, namely, resistance to the unnatural and bloody rebellion now raging throughout this unhappy land. Remember, my friends, that we have been born subjects to the kind and beneficent monarch who, at present, sits on the throne of Britain. Britain, that noble and illustrious isle, whose arts, and arms, and literature have shed a glorious radiance over the whole world, in which we, as her children, largely partake; and of which, if we were actuated by a proper sense of duty and gratitude for the benefits she has, by her fostering and protecting care, conferred upon us, we should be proud. Unhappily, a large portion of our countrymen have shown that they are not actuated by such generous motives. Stimulated by pride or selfishness, or misled by the sophistry and cant of turbulent orators, the great mass of our people have abandoned the path of duty, broken the ties of gratitude, set at nought their allegiance, and rushed into a wild, sanguinary, and desperate rebellion, which has already brought destruction on thousands, and must terminante in the absolute ruin of their audacious and ambitious schemes. “My friends, I am, in truth, amazed and grieved when I think on the state into which the affairs of these colonies, so lately blooming in peace and prosperity, are now plunged. I could scarcely imagine, did not woful experience convince me of the fact, that such a degree of turpitude as is sufficient to produce the present direful crisis, could exist in human bosoms. What! the sons of Britains separate themselves from Britain!— disconnect themselves from British prosperity, British virtue, British greatness, and British glory!—And for what object?—the paltry consideration of saving a few thousand pounds a year, which we were well able, and well entitled to pay; and which the slightest impulse of gratitude or honour ought to have rendered us willing to pay. And is it possible that the present horrid state of things has arisen from this sordid motive? Has it been a mere petty financial speculation that has driven three millions of people into the crime of rebellion against a parental government; and induced them to plunge into a sea of blood for the hope of saving annually a few pence per head, which they ought to have been proud to pay a generous parent, who had so lately expended millions for their sakes? But no; my fellow subjects, repugnance to parliamentary taxation, let the disorganizers pretend what they please, was not the cause which induced the majority of the leading rebels to raise their accursed standard. It was ambition. Our lawyers got an itch for making laws for a nation, hence they must have a congress. Our military captains wanted war that they might become generals: our sheriffs and magistrates, and forward politicians of every class, wanted independence, that they might become governors of states, or members of cabinets, or public functionaries of some kind, whereby they might make a figure in the land at the public expense. “But enough of these dishonest and dishonourable men, who have embroiled us with the mighty power to whom we owe allegiance, and with whose vast superiority of strength it is madness to contend. The distress into which their schemes have plunged the country renders them abhorred by every virtuous and well principled mind. My friends, I hope there is not one among you who does not loath and detest them as you would a pestilence; and will not be ready to hasten with just and holy vengeance upon them, as you would upon incendiaries whom you caught in the act of committing destruction upon all that you held dear and estimable, or accounted sacred and venerable upon earth. “I propose now to lead you against a nest of rebels of this stamp. They have not, indeed, taken the field against their sovereign, but they have abjured their allegiance, and thrown off the lawful authority under which their fathers and themselves were born. Strange, indeed, and depraved must be that state of society in which allegiance and loyalty are thrown aside with as little ceremony and reflection, as the casting off of a loose gown or a pair of slippers. It is against the whigs in the adjoining settlements, whose militia hold their fortifications for the rebel congress, that I propose to lead you, and I call upon you, by your allegiance, to follow me. That you may see I am authorized to make such a call, I request you to look upon this commission. It has the signature of Howe, as noble and brave a general as ever wore a sword. I have within these two weeks been in his presence: I have been honoured and delighted with his conversation; and have received from him authority to arm all his majesty's loyal subjects in this district, in order to reduce the people in the neighbourhood to obedience, and sieze upon their fortified places in the name of his majesty. Hearken to the reward offered us in the event of succeeding in this service. It is a rich one—no less than the whole valley of Wyoming, including all its improvements, dwellings, cattle, crops and property of every description, now forfeited by the rebellion of their present owners, to be divided amongst us in proportion to the merit we shall individually exhibit in the contest we may have to sustain. “If we are truly zealous in the cause, and I desirous to earn this rich reward, we cannot but succeed. The force against which we shall have to contend is not much more numerous than our own, nor is it better equipped for war, for of warlike stores the British general has taken care to supply us abundantly. Besides, what have we, inured as we are to all the toils and risks of war, and experienced in its arts and stratagems, to fear from a simple agricultural race, the majority of whom have never witnessed a battle nor destroyed a foe. It is my belief, my friends, that on the first appearance of danger, these men of timidity and peace, will submit, and acknowledge once more the authority of their legitimate sovereign, while we shall earn the reward of our loyalty by becoming the owners of the fair estates they have forfeited by their rebellion. “But should they unexpectedly resist, besides our own strength, we shall, in reducing them, have the powerful aid of the brave Mohawks, the chiefs of whom I have invited to this conference, in order to lay before them the proposals of General Howe for an alliance between them and the government of Britain. The liberality of the terms offered to these valiant people, cannot but secure their approbation and win their aid; and with such potent allies, what have we to fear from the feeble peasantry of Wyoming. “Thus, my friends, the crisis which to others is so gloomy and full of peril, opens to us a brilliant prospect of glorious victory and rich reward. Be courageous and resolute, and soon the pleasant dwellings in which we have been only sojourners, and the fertile fields which surround them, shall be our own—and we shall dispose of the present inhabitants according to their deserts. What say ye, my gallant friends, shall we raise the standard of loyalty in these regions, and strike for possessions so valuable?” A shout of applause was given by the auditors of this harangue, in answer to the question with which it concluded. This shout continued to resound for some minutes, and seemed to express the unanimous assent of the assembly to the proposal of the speaker. It was not unanimous, however. There was one man, and one too in whose staunch loyalty all present placed the firmest confidence, who opposed waging war against the people of Wyoming, for the purpose of despoiling them of their property. This man's name was Clifton, who had already suffered much for his royalism. He had the courage to address the assembly, and was listened to only on account of his known zeal for the royal cause, and the sacrifices he had made for it. The warm expressions of personal regard for him which General Howe had more than once used in the hearing of Butler, induced the latter to attend to his remarks without interruption, although not without impatience and a strong feeling of resentment. “Friends and fellow subjects,” said Clifton, “your zeal in behalf of the government under which we and our fathers have so long flourished, is worthy of all praise; and in these unhappy times of treason and rebellion, is refreshing and consolatory to every well-disposed mind. I would not damp your ardour in such a cause; but I would direct it to the ad option of justifiable measures. I do not wish you to sit down in sluggish apathy, while rebellion, like a raging monster, fills the land with blood and desolation. No, my friends, I rejoice to behold your enthusiasm—I would have you to be up and active in the cause of the lawful and just government under which our colonies have long enjoyed so many blessings; whose protection and care alone preserved them in the feebleness of their infancy, and reared them to their present state of maturity. “But I would have you to select proper objects for the display of your zeal. I would have you to direct your hostility to points where you could perform real service to your sovereign, and vindicate, upon enemies actually in the field, the majesty of his laws. I would have you to wield your energies against rebels—and there are abundance of such in the land—to whom you are under no obligations for hospitality, kindness and protection; and to whom you have made no pledges of amity and peace. I cannot suppose that you have so soon forgotten the forlorn and fugitive state under which we implored and received shelter and sustenance from the people of these settlements. We were driven from our homes, and like wild beasts, hunted into the forests by the vindictive power of our enemies. We fled hither, and threw ourselves on the mercy of the inhabitants of these valleys. Although they had embraced the cause of our enemies, and disapproved of the political and warlike course we had pursued, yet they saw us destitute and suffering, and their humanity relieved us. They received our assurances of living in tranquillity among them, and they afforded us habitations. They fed, they clothed, they lodged us. We are at this moment, pensioners on their bounty, protegees of their care; and, trusting in our promises of peaceable behaviour, they have taken no precautions against our hostility, as if they could not dream that men were to be found so wicked as to aim I 2 insidious and dark destruction against protecting and confiding friends. “The king's general requires us to arm; I say too let us arm, since we have obtained the means. But let us arm against our enemies; not against our friends. The king has abundance of foes who are no friends of ours. Let us march to the sea-board; we shall there find rebels to whom we owe no gratitude, whom it will be our duty to subdue, and for subduing whom, the royal authorities will be as grateful, and, no doubt, reward us as liberally, as for subduing a people less deeply plunged in the guilt of rebellion, and to respect whose welfare we are bound by every tie of gratitude and honour.” When Clifton ceased speaking, a mixed sensation seemed to pervade the assembly—a murmur expressive of divided sentiments, was distinctly heard in various directions; for many were in reality, forcibly struck with the justice of his arguments and the propriety of his views. This feeling of rectitude, however, did not prevail long. Butler hastened to stem the current that was setting against his designs; and by his address he completely succeeded in giving it a contrary direction. “What!” said he, “have I, in reality, heard sentiments of lukewarmness in the cause of Britain, from one who has hitherto been so devoted to her interests; who has fought and bled and lost his all for his fidelity to the government that claims his allegiance! But it is the weakness of humanity—it is the mere frothing of the milk of human kindness, which now prevails over his natural vigour of soul, and enfeebles his energies with scruples of sickly sentiment and morbid sensibility. We are distinctly called upon by the British general, to seize and occupy the fortresses of the Wyoming valley, in behalf of the king, and to compel the inhabitants to return to their allegiance.” Here Butler read a commission which he had received from general Howe, appointing him to the command of such of the frontier royalists as might join his standard. He also read to the assembly a paper of instructions, requiring him to use every effort in his power to reduce the malecontents of Wyoming, and to preserve the district in subjection to the regal authority. This paper likewise contained the promise of bestowing on him and his coadjutors in this service, all the lands of the district whose owners should be convicted of any act of disloyalty. “Now,” said he, after he had finished reading these documents, “all who are willing to obey the orders of general Howe, and to serve their king, and earn the reward offered for such service, will come forward, enrol their names on the list of the king's friends, and swear fidelity to his cause. Those who refuse had better now retire from this assembly, for in half an hour they shall be treated as enemies.” None retired. All were either convinced or intimidated by Butler's statement. Even Clifton tacitly yielded to the opinions of the majority, and made no further opposition. One Ford, an active and violent tory, was appointed to administer the oath of fidelity to the assembly; while Butler and two or three other leaders withdrew to hold a conference with the Indian chiefs. The calumet was lighted, and each having smoked from it, Aranooko arose, and addressed Butler. “Brother, we received your message, and are here. Tell us the will of our father, the great king of the east. We would be his friends, and if his wishes be reasonable, we will obey him. The Mohawks have suffered much from the people of your race, the disobedient children of your father beyond the great lake. Our revenge has lately been asleep; but if the voice of your father comes in friendship to us, we will hear, we will awake—we will kindle up the fierceness of our wrath, like the angry panther when hunted in his native woods. We will be a rod in the hands of your father to chastise his unruly children—we will be a flaming brand to avenge our own wrongs. You have heard me, brother; now speak.” “Brave Mohawks!” replied Butler, “our father knows ye are valiant, and he asks your aid. He knows ye have been wronged, and he bids you avenge yourselves. The chief captain of his host bade me say to you, that he will supply you with clothing, and with instruments of war sufficient for your whole tribe. Ask what else you want, and it shall be given, for you are a brave people, and we wish for your friendship.” “Brother,” said Aranooko—“clothing and arms are all we want. Our forests supply us with food, and with fuel, and with timber for wigwams. We want no more.—But when we do, we shall ask it. We are your friends. The disobedient of your race are our enemies. We will join you in war against them.—Receive our Wampum!” So saying, he handed to Butler, a long string of beads made of red berries, in testimony of the league. In return for which Butler made him a present of several trinkets he had provided for the purpose. Brandt now arose. His eyes glanced fire for some moments, then cooled into a settled gleam of ferocious satisfaction: while pride perched on his heavy brows, determination expanded his large lips, and imparted a clenching firmness to the vigorous muscles of his whole frame, as he addressed himself to Butler. “Brother,” said he, “You and I are now leagued in one cause. You have rebellion to punish. I have wrongs to avenge. Our victims are the same. I devote them to death. Let no man step between me and my purpose! Brother, I am determined on slaughter. They shall die! Are you of my mind?” Butler himself was startled at the fiendish ferocity with which the savage asked this question. He paused for a moment, as if to recover from his surprise, and to reflect on an answer. He then said: “Brother, our minds agree. Blood must flow. Death must mark our course, for rebellion must be rooted out, and your vengeance be appeased. Brother, our hearts are one. I feel that we are colleagues in a work destined to eternize our names as perpetrators of unparralleled deeds.—Brother, shall we exchange gifts in token of the compact of blood?” Butler received a sharp hatchet in return for a poignard, on handing which to Brandt, he observed, “The point of that steel is for the hearts of thy enemies, until thy revenge is glutted!—The edge of this hatchet is for the necks of rebels until they be cut off from the land!” “Why wert thou not born a Mohawk?” exclaimed Brandt. “Thy sternness is worthy of our nation, and in fierceness of spirit we are brothers!” At this moment the party were startled with a discharge of musketry, and a cry of terror and distress which rent the air, and announced that they were attacked by the whigs. Butler, Brandt, Aranooko, and all, indeed, who were inside of the log-house, rushed out to lend assistance to their friends, but they found them in full flight, and were themselves borne off the scene by a torrent of fugitives which they could not resist. In a moment colonel Dennison and his militia occupied the ground on which the tories had been assembled, whence they detached a strong party in pursuit of the fugitives. The closeness of the woods and intricacies of the country, favoured the flight of the latter, and only about forty fell into the hands of their pursuers. Among these was Clifton, who was immediately released, on account of the effort he had made in opposition to the proposal to attack Wyoming, which was communicated to the whigs by one of their party who had acted as a spy among the conspirators.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. Ingratitude! thou poisoner of the heart, That mak'st it dead to all the joys of life, What fiend engendered thee! and brought thee forth, And let thee loose upon the sons of men! So that the one upon the other plays Such arts of treachery, as sting the soul With tortures keener than the adder's fang! Oh! thou dost wring the meek confiding spirit, With wrong'd affection's fierce, envenomed grip, Until the world seems to the writhing victim, A wilderness of pit-falls, thorns and briers, With not one green nor sunny spot therein. Harley. Who has made any progress on the journey of life, and mingled, in any degree, with society, without experiencing the truth of the above sentiments? What has produced to human hearts more intense pangs than ingratitude? To be injured by those on whom we have conferred no favour, on whom we have fixed no esteem, and lavished no bounty, occasions but little surprise, and inspires but little dissatisfaction with human nature. We can still, after such an injury, look upon the world and upon mankind, in their natural colours, compounded of the various and ever-changing shades of good and evil, and remain satisfied with ourselves. Hope blends with fortitude, and enables us to bear present ills in anticipation of future good. But when we have detected the lurking animosities of a favourite, or received an insidious blow from one whom we have trusted, aided, or esteemed, grief for disappointed hopes and lost affections, mortification at being duped by hypocrisy, and horror at witnessing such a manifestation of the perfidy of man, contribute much more than the amount of the injury received, to inspire us with gloomy views of our nature and condition, and render us discontented with existence. How intensely, on this occasion, did the astonished people of Wyoming experience such feelings! The greater number of the individuals who were detected in this foul conspiracy against their lives and properties, had been the welcome partakers of their bounty, many of them the confidants of their secrets, and some of them bound to their affections by the closest ties of relationship or marriage. When the prisoners were conducted through several of the villages on their way to the fort at Wyoming, how grievously did many a confiding heart shudder to reflect how it had been betrayed, and to perceive that its destruction had been contrived by those on whom its confidence had been placed without restraint, and its kindness lavished without limits. Perhaps there was no circumstance connected with these agitating scenes more remarkable K than the forbearance of the inhabitants of Wyoming towards their captured betrayers. The bare idea that such a treacherous and murderous combination had been projected, was enough to inflame the blood of its intended victims, and to arouse them to a degree of indignation which, had it arisen and overwhelmed their prisoners in immediate destruction, would have been neither so wonderful nor censurable as many ebullitions of popular fury which history has recorded, nor half so flagitious and detestable as the foul conspiracy it would have avenged. But no excess of this kind was committed. The generous inhabitants of the district were more grieved than irritated at the example of treachery and barbarous depravity they now witnessed. Alarm and sorrow, rather than indignation and rage, filled their hearts and actuated their feelings. To their governor, Zebulon Butler, who, though the relative of their arch enemy, was a tried and faithful friend to their cause, and to five of the most intelligent of their known patriots, whom they selected to form his council, they committed the management of their affairs at this critical juncture. Mr. Norwood, Mr. Austin, Dr. Watson, Colonel Dennison, and the judge of their court, whose name was Harvey, formed this council; and a more judicious selection could not have been made. In the honesty and prudence of these men, the inhabitants placed implicit reliance. Nor did they place it wrongfully.— Whatever zeal, vigilance and correct judgment could effect for the safety of the district, was accomplished. But their resources were small in comparison to those of their enemies, who were in league with the powerful tribe of the Mohawks, and supplied with all the materials of war, by the British General. The aspect of the affairs of the settlement was indeed extremely menacing. The inhabitants had, it is true, detected and frustrated a fearful plot, which, had it with matured force burst upon them by surprise, would have found them almost totally unprepared for resistance, and would inevitably have effected their destruction. But although this imminent danger had been escaped, safety was far from being secured. The clouds of a tremendous and savage war were gathering around them. They saw them with the apprehension of rational beings, who could estimate probabilities and appreciate consequences. But they trusted in Providence, and did not sit down indolently to await the bursting of the storm in the apathy of despair. They assumed the fortitude of men conscious of a good cause, and they made every preparation for defence that judgment could suggest or circumstances would permit. All among them, fit to bear arms, were enrolled, and instructed to be in readiness to act on the first alarm. Despatches were also forwarded to Washington, informing him of the threatening aspect of their affairs, and their defenceless condition; and requesting military aid as soon as he could possibly send it. The Wyoming volunteers were also implored by many private letters, to return to the protection of their friends and their homes. It was little more than a week after the dispersion of the conspirators in the Hemlock Glade, as mentioned in the preceding chapter, that an incident happened which greatly increased the consternation of the Whigs, and excited them to stronger feelings of resentment than any thing that had yet occurred.—Mr. Norwood had returned home on the evening of a warm day in June, from a meeting of his fellow counsellors at the governor's house, when learning that his daughter had gone into the orchard which skirted the stream of the Sharon, in order to enjoy the coolness of the evening air, he hastened to join her. He found her seated near the bank of the stream on a favourite spot, where she had often sat with Henry Austin. She had been reading, probably for the twentieth time, a letter lately received from Henry. This letter described to her the joyous entry of the troops under Washington into Philadelphia, which had been evacuated by the British force now under the command of sir Henry Clinton. The glowing style of triumphant patriotism, and the ardent expressions of undiminished love, which pervaded this communication from the chosen of her heart, warmed her feelings and engrossed her attention so entirely, that the alarming aspect of the affairs of her own neighbourhood were for a time forgotten; her whole faculties were employed in the contemplation of her absent lover. His numerous virtues, his patriotism, his courage, and the unchanging and unchangeable nature of his love for her— the toils he had undergone—the privations he had endured, and the dangers he had encountered in the performance of his duty of his country—all stood imaged in her mind as personifications of the highest excellence that could dignify the character and conduct of man. And he had been rewarded for these virtues and privations. He had seen his country's chief and her gallant army, in triumph enter her capital, which had just been abandoned by a retiring enemy.—He had himself formed part of the glorious procession. And now he was in the midst of a populous and fascinating metropolis. —Her thoughts instantly flowed in another K 2 current. Would he be able to resist the fascinations of gayety, beauty and splendor which the new scenes he should now witness would present to him? Amidst the many accomplished females to whom he would now become introduced, would there be none sufficiently attractive to make an impression on his heart? She wished to get rid of the unwelcome suggestion. To harbour it was painful, and might be unjust— nay, when she reflected on the vows and the virtues of Henry, she felt assured that it was unjust.—“No,” thought she, “no allurements will lead him from the path of fidelity. The temptations that shall assail him may be great; but his virtue is great—his love is sincere, and he will triumph over them all.” She was indulging this train of thought when her father approached her. “My daughter,” said he, “the messenger to general Washington has been despatched. Your letter to Henry has gone with him. I fervently pray that at least our own brave volunteers, who serve under him, may return to our aid, before the savages and tories shall have time to combine their forces and attack us.” “The distance is great and the road difficult;” she observed, “but when they hear of our danger, affection will give wings to their speed, and I trust in Heaven, that they will reach us in time to secure our safety.” “Their force is but small,” said Mr. Norwood, “but their military skill would be of immense value. We have requested general Washington for more extensive aid, which, I trust, he will be able to spare us, since the invading enemy has been, at length, compelled to make a retrogade motion, and to retreat, as we have just heard, across the Jerseys, towards New York, followed by the whole patriotic army.” “But, father,” said she, “this removes our friends farther from our assistance. Heaven only knows at what distance they may be, when our messenger reaches them. Our situation is, indeed, perilous. Our prospects are forlorn.” “Do not be alarmed, my Agnes!” returned her father. “Our messenger is well acquainted with the country, and he has been ordered to take the direct course into Jersey, and find the head-quarters of Washington by the shortest road. But lest he should fail, two other messengers will be despatched to-morrow. Nor are we in such immediate danger, nor so totally destitute of strength, as to justify despondency. Our men have all assumed arms— they seem brave and resolute, and will nobly resist any attack that the traitors and their savage allies may make upon us. And one or two of our forts are strong—” “Traitors and their savage allies!” exclaimed a large man in a mask, who, followed by two savages, rushed upon them from the midst of some bushes on the bank of the rivulet, where they had been concealed. The savages seized Mr. Norwood, tied his hands behind him, and hurried him off. The man in the mask caught Agnes, whom, without binding, he attempted also to carry away. She screamed and struggled, but he succeeded in removing her out of the orchard. She ceased her cries, and assuming a tone of entreaty, begged for a few moments' respite. She was taunted with the exclamation— “Traitors and their savage allies! These were harsh terms. You and your father, fair maid, shall soon know how far they are applicable.” He however slackened his pace with the view of treating her more mildly, as he added in a conciliatory tone—“you at least have nothing to fear. Unless too obstinate, your father and you shall be both well treated. I love you and wish to separate you from a rebellious people destined to destruction. Behold me, and believe my words!” He withdrew his mask and presented the countenance of Butler. An instinctive alarm seized her, and she again screamed aloud. At that instant a man on horseback gallopped towards them, the wood being sufficiently open to admit his approach. Butler drew forth a pistol. Agnes with great presence of mind, watched his motions, and, at the moment he fired, she shook his arm so forcibly, that the accuracy of his aim was destroyed, and he missed the advancing horseman. He uttered a profane exclamation of disappointment, and, perceiving the horseman to be in the act of presenting a pistol, he fled, and was soon concealed amidst the woods. “My father—my father is carried off by the savages!” cried Agnes, as Dr. Watson, for he was the horseman, alighted in order to raise and support her, for her alarm having overpowered her, she had sunk upon the ground. The main road was but a short distance from the scene of this incident. The Doctor had been riding past when he heard her cries. He hastened to her assistance. He was armed as has been stated. Since the times became dangerous he had never ventured from home with out being so. When Butler missed him and fled, he prudently reserved his fire that he might the more effectually protect Agues from any other assailant until she could be conveyed to a place of safety. This he soon accomplished, and hastened to raise a party to go in pursuit of the captors of Mr. Norwood. It will be readily supposed that so violent an outrage on the person of a clergyman so much esteemed as Mr. Norwood, would produce strong sensations of both sorrow and resentment in the minds of his people. Several hundred were speedily in active chase of the savages. But the latter, whom Butler soon overtook, knew the lurking places of the woods too well to be easily captured. For several days they were briskly pursued. But they finally escaped, and arrived safe, with their worn-out prisoner, after a perilous and toilsome journey, at the chief village of the Mohawks, where the tories had formed an encampment. Oh! Agnes, unhappy daughter of an unfortunate father, to what desolation of heart wert thou now subjected! What horrors did thy bereaved and fearful spirit imagine to be the doom of thy beloved and only parent! The vengeful bitterness and capricious cruelty of the savage nature were well known to thee— and was thy father now destined to endure them! Was his aged and venerable frame to run the cruel gauntlet, and sustain the scorn and the blows of Mohawk ferocity? Or does thy terrified imagination behold the blazing faggots, and the stake to which he is bound, in order to be consumed, amidst the shouting vengeance of exulting fiends in the shape of men? Is he doomed to that most cruel of all deaths to which savage vengeance is accustomed to devote its victims? Art thou, in thy misery of mind, capable of enduring the terrible thought? Or hast thou consolation? Does hope whisper any solace to thy heart? Dost thou listen to the suggestions of comfort? Dost thou not rather repel them as fallacious, and beg thy comforters to depart—to leave thee to silence— to sorrow—to hopelessness—to despair! No; —although thy grief is intense—almost too great for thy tender frame to endure, thou art a Christian, and wilt not harbour thoughts of despair. Thy spirit is too strongly imbued with the pious principles which thy father taught thee, to question the designs of Heaven in inflicting calamities, or to murmur at the rod of chastisement although it pierces thee to the heart. There is a Rock of comfort to which he, for whom thou grievest, taught thee to look for support under every affliction. And thou rememberest his instructions—thou lookest to the God of Christians for support in thy bereavement—for solace in thy sorrow, and for deliverance from thy affliction! Hence thou wilt not listen to the suggestions of despair. Thou art sick, and sorrowful, and wretched— thou canst not help suffering, but thou sufferest with piety—with meekness and resignation. The unrepining but intense grief of Agnes, although it could not overcome the strength of her mind, overpowered that of her body. Sickness seized upon her. A strong fever ran through her veins, and prostrated her strength. The solicitude with which Dr. Watson attended to a patient so beloved may be readily imagined. His sister, her faithful friend, now became her anxious and diligent nurse. She made her abode with her, and her assiduous cares and judicious counsels contributed much both to mitigate her fever and to shorten its duration. Her recovery, however, was chiefly owing to intelligence contained in the following letter, which she received about a week after the capture of her father, from the author of the outrage. “This letter is written by a man you hate; yet you will receive it with satisfaction. With satisfaction do I write it, because it will give pleasure to the woman I love—the only woman I ever loved. It pleases me also to think that the characters I now trace will be perused by you—will be gazed upon by those eyes which have struck the fire of love into my soul.—But I hasten to communicate the circumstance which is the object of my writing, and which alone will make my letter acceptable.—Your father lives—he is well treated— and, for your sake, until I hear from you, I shall secure to him a continuance of good treatment. “Believe me this will not be an easy task. What I have already done for him, has encountered much opposition. The half Indian Brandt,—he who escaped from the attack upon you, which afforded me the first occasion of beholding your loveliness, and of rendering you some service,—has not forgotten that he was once a prisoner in your village. He is inveterately hostile to all your people. He will go any length, he will submit to any hardship, he will expose himself to any danger, he will commit any crime to be revenged on the feeblest and most innocent among you. I had to sooth and conciliate him, and make even humiliating concessions to him, ere I could obtain his forgiveness for the part I acted in your rescue. His knowledge of the breach between your people and me, and an assurance that we are now irreconcilable enemies, tended to mollify him; my influence among the royalists whom he views as necessary instruments of his revenge, procured for me his respect, and, in some measure, his confidence; and my proposal L to join him in the late attempt to carry you off, has attached him entirely to my interests. “It was you I wanted, my love, and not your father. But when, from our lurking place, we discovered him to be with you, the Indians proposed to seize both, and I made no objection. I was rather pleased with the circumstance. My passion for you is vehement. I know your aversion to me. Your father being in my hands, might afford me the power of working on your mind, so as to gain your consent to become mine. I now lament the circumstance of your father being present. I have no ill-will towards him. I wish no harm to befall him. His being with you occasioned the failure of my great object to secure you. It drew the attention of the Indians from you. I thought my own strength sufficient to bear you off. It would have been so, had I not been desirous to effect my purpose with as little harshness as possible. I refrained from stifling your cries by force. I even indulged you by relaxing my speed when we left the orchard, for I wished to show you that you would be treated tenderly. That relaxation ruined the whole project. You renewed your cries. Your friend approached. I knew not how many might be following him. I cursed my ill-starred fate, and to avoid instant destruction, abandoned you. “I have gained something, however, by the enterprise. Your father is my prisoner. I see my advantage in this, and I am determined to profit by it. Let the irresistible nature of my love for you excuse my design. Your father must be my instrument to gain, or if the expression must be used, to extort, your consent to my wishes. I have already stated that I have protected him from injury. I have claimed him from the savages as my own prisoner. I have preserved him from the torments of their cruel customs. I have saved him from the humiliation and blows of the gauntlet, and from the fiery horrors of the stake. Do I not merit recompense for this? Will you not be grateful? Will you not attribute my exertions— for to do these things required exertions—to the ardour of my love? I would restore him to liberty, but my power over you would be then lost. No; I must have you. My conceptions of happiness are so entirely wrought up with the idea of possessing you, that I swear to you, I shall stop short of no effort that circumstances may put in my power, to obtain that great good for which I so passionately long. I disdain every other luxury—I disdain mirth and exhilaration—nay, I disdain reputation and power—I would disdain life itself but for the hope that it may last till you have blest me with your charms. “Hear now my purpose. Your father's fate is in my hands. It is in yours. Your conduct to me shall regulate mine to him. Let me know your resolves, and let me know them soon. The aspect of the times will admit of no delay. I enclose a safe-conduct for any messenger you may send me. Should you decide on coming here to see your father, and to be mine, it will be prudent to communicate your design to me privately, lest the people among whom you live, should prevent its accomplishment. Your messenger will hear of me at the wigwam of Aranooko. If he comes not soon, I shall not expect him at all. Fierce and prompt measures shall then be adopted, and remember who is in my power. Oh! drive me not, thou most fascinating of thy sex, to the adoption of measures that may sink thee into affliction, that humanity may deplore, that I myself may view with horror! If thou refusest to make me happy, most solemnly do I swear to make thousands miserable. Arouse not my energies to do mischief, or terribly, on all whom thou dost love, will I revenge thy hatred of me. John Butler.” What a diversity of feelings did this letter excite in the bosom of Agnes? With what contending emotions did it agitate her whole frame? Her immediate sorrow was relieved. Her father was alive—was safe. How earnestly did she rejoice—how ardently did she thank Heaven! But how long should he be safe? That depended upon her determination. Cruel consideration! She could not, she dared not comply with the terms on which her father would be spared. Her love was given, her faith was sworn, her hand was RETROTHED—to another. She could not be Butler's without being faithless and perjured. To save her father she would cheerfully die; but could she wrong her soul? Could she become a bold offender against Heaven and subject herself to perdition?—No, no —her father himself would shudder at the thought. She must reject the dreadful alternative, be the consequence what it would. To Mary Watson she showed the letter, and explained her perplexities, and from her she requested counsel. “Heaven be praised,” she said, “my father is alive; and he has not been tortured. But how shall I save him from the perils with which he is threatened. Oh! my friend, thy judgment is clear—counsel me what I shall do!” L 2 “Thy situation is, indeed, perplexing,” said Miss Watson, “what counsel to give it is difficult to determine. Concession to the demands of this wicked man cannot be thought of. To refuse him entirely might be to seal thy father's fate. To defer making any reply to his letter might gain time for the occurrence of some favourable event. But that is uncertain; and he threatens harshness in case of delay. To deceive him by a feigned and conditional compliance, would be the safest course; but would it be proper? Would it be justifiable? These are questions which require a clearer judgment than mine, to resolve.” “Alas!” said Agnes, “in what a situation am I placed, when the least unhappy alternative for me to adopt is deception!” “But it is deception to prevent cruelty and crime,” observed Miss Watson, “and deception too that will injure no one. Does this not argue something in its favour?” “I would fain reconcile my conscience to its adoption in this instance, ”said Agnes, “but I cannot. The motive for the imposition may be laudable. But still it would be imposition. It would be promising to do that which I am resolved not to do—Oh, Mary Watson, would you advise me to be guilty of falsehood?” “I am, indeed, bewildered on the subject,” replied Miss Watson. “Anxiously do I wish for the adoption of some means to preserve your father,—and I can see no other than your consenting to deceive the wicked man into whose power he has fallen. Yet, I acknowledge, the idea of your committing a deliberate falsehood, is a painful one. It would be truly desirable to avoid it. Perhaps my brother may be able to suggest some means of extricating you out of this difficulty.” “I should like to consult him,” said Agnes. “His wisdom may point out the correct course for me to steer. On his friendship for aid in my present distress, I implicitly rely, and I feel that I do not rely in vain.” A message was despatched for Dr. Watson, and he was soon in the presence of Agnes. When he heard her statement, “Thank Providence,” said he,—“they have not murdered your father! While there is life there is hope. Butler must, if possible, be kept in uncertainty respecting your determination. Peremptorily to reject his terms might be fatal to your father. You must write soothingly—but let me reflect —before you write, I will consult a friend whose counsel and whose aid, if any man's can, will serve us on this occasion. He is at present in our village.” He withdrew, and returned in about a quarter of an hour, with the Hermit of the woods. “My daughter,” said the Hermit, “I respect your scruples. Whether they be, in this instance, overstrained or not, I would have you for ever to cherish them. They are valuable proofs of upright feelings—precious marks of a pure mind. Yet, commendable as this rigid adherence to literal veracity, under all circumstances, is, in our course through life, we may often find the exercise of contrivance and stratagem requisite for self-preservation; and to use artifice against the deceitful must be sometimes allowable. It is but meeting them with their own weapons. To use it against such a dark and depraved dissembler as Butler, and, as in the present case, for the purpose of preserving the life of a virtuous man, can hardly be considered wrong. But since you have scruples on the subject, you do well to hearken to them. They proceed from correct principles; and so long as they regulate your conduct, you will not be likely to go astray.—If you will commit to me the management of this affair, I will endeavour to effect the preservation of your father, without obliging you to offend against your conscience. You are betrothed to another. You cannot promise yourself to Butler, without speaking a wilful untruth. Yet on such a promise the safety of your father seems to depend. Fear not, my child;—adhere to the strict principles of integrity which are the foundation of your virtuous scruples. The consciousness of doing so will be an unfailing solace in every trial. I will exert myself in behalf of your father. Will you trust to my efforts?” “You have spoken comfort to my heart,” she replied. “Not only will I trust you, but my thanks and my prayers shall attend your generous efforts. Save my father, and the justice of Heaven will reward you: it will be a deed beyond the power of man to reward!” The Hermit departed; and Agnes full of confidence in the success of his exertions, soon threw off the despondency which had weighed so heavily upon her, and bloomed once more in renewed health and recovered spirits.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. Should simplicity be opposed to cunning, and openness of heart to deep guile? As well might we oppose the lamb to the fox, or the trembling fawn to the crouching tiger. No; let snares be set for the deceiver, and let the deviser of fraud fall into his own pit. So shall honesty triumph over baseness, and wisdom show herself stronger than fraud. —Talmud. Although the Hermit approved of the scruples of Agnes on the subject of deception, and encouraged her to persevere, on all occasions, in a system of strict veracity, yet the moral code which he prescribed for himself was not quite so rigid. Injurious or even unnecessary untruths he detested. Such, he conceived, could never come but from a corrupt source. But he had great knowledge of human nature—of its condition in this life—its liability to be affected by circumstances which it cannot control, and which frequently change its position in respect to abstract morality, rendering the obligations of the latter more or less incumbent, according to events and situations. He had often been witness of alternatives which left only a choice of crimes. To choose the least was assuredly then the duty, and he who did so was, in his opinion, entitled to praise instead of censure. “To destroy the life of another in self-defence,” he reasoned, “has never been considered immoral. Neither is it thought immoral to break a promise or even an oath which is enforced by the fear of violence. How then can it be criminal to dissuade a ruffian from the commission of murder by communicating to him information which is known to be untrue? What is, in most other cases, a crime, becomes here a virtue. It is used as an instrument of good; and to forbear the use of it, when it is found that no other instrument will answer the purpose, is to omit doing the good, and to participate in the enormous guilt which the omission permits to take place.” If such were the Hermit's views, why did he not counsel Agnes to save her father by deceiving Butler? His motives were various. Truth is, at all times beautiful, and rarely indeed, is a breach of it commendable. To accustom young and ingenuous minds, therefore, to reverence it at all times, and to ward off from their experience, as much as possible, any occurrence that might justify deception, is to consult their welfare by strengthening their integrity. For this reason, the Hermit did not wish Agnes to diverge from the direct line of truth even for a good purpose, when that purpose might be otherwise obtained, which he believed it might by his own agency. Besides, he was a believer in the doctrine of the impulses of conscience being the criterion of good or evil actions. The scruples of Agnes, proved that in practising the proposed deception, she would have acted against the dictates of her conscience, and, therefore, in his view, would have been criminal. Should he find deception to be necessary to save Mr. Norwood, he had no scruples against using it himself. In such a case he would experience no compunction, while he would save a young female whom he esteemed, from doing what might afterwards inflict upon her the pangs of remorse. In short, whether the Hermit's reasoning on this subject was right or wrong, it will be admitted that his intentions and conduct were benevolent. He had in view two schemes for the delivery of Mr. Norwood. The first was to use an agent whom he could instruct in a certain stratagem which might effect the purpose, and thereby obviate the necessity of himself appearing on the scene and deceiving Butler in relation to Agnes; an alternative which he wished to avoid, but if found necessary, he was resolved to adopt. On leaving Agnes he proceeded to the residence of a young man named Joseph Jennings. Joseph, though rugged in his manners, possessed a warm heart, and was devotedly, or rather superstitiously, attached to Mr. Norwood, whose clerical character he esteemed as the perfection of human excellence, and whose abduction he conceived to be a sacrilegious crime that could not fail to be visited by the vengeance of Heaven. Joseph was stout, active and fearless. From his earliest youth he had been a hunter of the wild beasts of the forest, and was, in consequence, acquainted with every hill and valley, defile and cavern, river, swamp and lake, in the whole of the broad region that lies between the two great branches of the Susquehanna. He possessed also that quick and shrewd conception, which, when found among the uneducated classes of mankind, is more observable, perhaps because less expected, than when found among those who have had better opportunities of mental cultivation and intellectual improvement. It was with the aid of this youth that the Hermit proposed to effect the deliverance of Mr. Norwood; and he found him a ready and zealous auxiliary in the enterprise. He accompanied him to a cavern about ten miles distant from the residence of the sachem Aranooko, in the neighbourhood of which Mr. Norwood was confined under the immediate surveillance of Butler himself. From this cavern, Joseph proceeded alone on the enterprise. He had received instructions from the Hermit in relation to the measures he should adopt. He pushed M forward boldly with a resolution to act the royalist to the heart's content of the tories, who had on the detection of their conspiracy, fled, in great numbers, from the Wyoming settlements, to the country occupied by the Mohawks, near the chief village of which they had formed an encampment. Joseph entered this encampment singing, at the top of his lungs, “God save the king.” His hunting pursuits, by keeping him at a distance from society, had prevented his political predilections, which were decidedly whig, from being generally known. It was, therefore, not doubted but that he was sincere in his present manifestations of loyalty; and that, as he now pretended, he had fled from the threats of the Wyoming whigs, to seek shelter among men whose sentiments were more in accordance with his own. He was soon introduced to Butler, furnished with arms at the expense of king George, and enrolled among the faithful defenders of his majesty's crown and government. Joseph knew the value of time, and was no laggard on an errand of importance. He soon discovered the tent in which Mr. Norwood was confined. He had some slight acquaintance with the sentinel placed over the reverend captive for that evening. It was late in the evening when Joseph approached this sentinel in a seemingly careless manner, with a flask of rum in his hand. He tipt him a jovial wink, and offered to treat him. Good humour is always infectious, especially when good fare is offered with it. Joseph's was at this time irresistible to the sentinel, who willingly pledged him in a bumper, which was soon repeated; and Joseph seated himself on a log beside his sociable companion and began to talk of the times. “When do you think, Ephraim,” said he, “we shall have to fight the whigs? I guess when we muster our forces, Indians and all, they wont stand us long.” “The time of marching will be fixed to-morrow,” said Ephraim. “Who fixes it?” inquired Joseph. “The Indian chiefs are to hold a council for the purpose,” replied Ephraim, “and our leaders are to assist at their deliberations.” Another glass, drank to the success of their enterprise, followed this information. “How does the old preacher stand his confinement?” asked Joseph. “He seems patient enough under it,” answered Ephraim. “Is he well treated?” inquired Joseph. “Pretty well as yet,” was the reply. “But he is not likely to be much longer indulged as he has been. Butler and he have had a violent quarrel to-day.” “How?—but no matter,” said Joseph. “It is none of our concern, you know. Here Ephraim, another glass to the success of the right side. This empties the flask.” “The more's the pity,” said Ephraim, again partaking of Joseph's spiritual kindness, the effects of which on his intellects had now become visible. “Did you hear nothing of the cause of their dispute?” asked Joseph. “Cause!—hic—darn the cause! Guess it was politics—Care nothing about it—hic-up—darn this sentry duty—curse the rebels! hic—they give so much trouble— hic-up.” Joseph, who perceived that his friend, whose notions of military discipline were not very orthodox, had got into the delectable care-for-nobody state which suited his design, proposed to relieve him for a short time of his irksome duty, by assuming it in his stead. “If Butler or Bateman—hic-up—finds that I have left my post—hic”—muttered Ephraim. But without finishing the sentence, his ideas took another turn, and he exclaimed, “Darn them, what care I for them. I'm as good a man as any of them. I am for king George— hic-up! Guess I'll have a frolic. Some of the boys are carousing in Josh. Juggles's tent! Keep my post for half an hour—bravo! darn it —now for spree! hic-up!” And away Ephraim staggered in pursuit of jollity and rum, leaving Joseph in possession of the premises. Joseph's difficulty, however, was not yet over. The tent contained more inmates than Mr. Norwood. Butler himself and two or three other royalists were it inhabitants. It is true, from the lateness of the hour, eleven o'clock at night, the presumption was that they were asleep; but that presumption was the same in regard to Mr. Norwood. Besides, Joseph knew not which bed was occupied by the latter gentleman, and he might awake some other person in his stead. He had a bold heart, however, and he resolved to make an effort to effect his design, trusting to some favourable circumstance, and his own dexterity for success. He cautiously entered the tent, and perceived by means of a dim lamp that flickered in one corner, three beds spread on the floor, two of which apparently contained more than one individual. In the third which was the farthest from the entrance, he conjectured there was but one person, whom from the appearance of an article of dress which lay upon it, he believed to be the object of his solicitude. Joseph, while he supplied Ephraim so liberally with M 2 the rum, had taken care to use it very sparingly himself, so that he was in possession of all his faculties, with perhaps a little elevation of courage suited to the occasion. He approached the bed which he believed to contain Mr. Norwood; but he was mistaken. It contained Butler himself, who was in a sound sleep. He examined the other dormitories, but was greatly chagrined to find that the object of his search was in neither of them. He was retiring very reluctantly and with much mortification, when he heard a cough which he thought was familiar to his ear, and perceived the movement of a curtain which he had before mistaken for part of the enclosure of the tent. He was also agreeably surprised at seeing the curtain drawn aside, and the well-known countenance of his reverend friend looking at him. He hastily motioned to Mr. Norwood to preserve silence, and to follow him. Mr. Norwood knew Joseph well, and instantly comprehended his intention. “This is a providential interference”— thought he—“I will avail myself of it.” He beckoned to Joseph that he understood him and would follow. Joseph immediately withdrew, and, in a few minutes Mr. Norwood joined him outside of the tent; a few more carried them into a part of the woods which effectually secured them from detection.— Through the intricacies of the forest, there could not be a better guide than Joseph, and early the next morning he conducted his venerable protegee into the cavern where he had the day previous left the Hermit of the woods. In three or four days more, Mr. Norwood received the embraces of his pious and affectionate daughter, and the heart-felt congratulations of all the people of Wyoming.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. The council meets, and vengeance is decreed;— War's demon is unchained, and blood-shot rage Whets his fierce appetite, and spurs his steed To the death-revelling field, the strife to wage, Where innocence as well as guilt shall bleed; But, if he can with human suffering feed His fell voracity for mortal wo, He cares not;—let the weapon but succeed, To him no matter who endures the blow, The wound it makes shall cause the demon's joy to glow! Harley. No demon of wrath could exhibit more fury than did Butler on discovering that his important prisoner had escaped. The sentinel whose neglect of duty had occasioned this mischance, was brought trembling into his presence. In vain did he acknowledge his crime and implore pardon. In vain did he plead that he had been deceived by one who had deceived Butler himself—one who had that very day been enrolled among the king's friends, and seemed particularly zealous for the royal cause. Poor Ephraim was handed over to some tory officers who formed themselves into a species of court martial, for the purpose of trying him for his offence. As strict discipline was, as yet, far from being properly established among the tory bands that now rallied round the standard of Butler, and as there was some danger of exciting discontent in their ranks, if Ephraim should be punished too severely, he was merely sentenced to be first publicly reprimanded, and afterwards exposed in an open space in the centre of the encampment, with his legs confined in a wooden frame resembling stocks, for twenty four hours. Butler was greatly dissatisfied with the lenity of this sentence; but reflecting that too much harshness might shake his popularity among a body of men who were not yet accustomed to subordination, he acquiesced. He, however, determined to urge forward, with all speed, the measures that were in preparation for an attack upon the settlements of Wyoming. In expectation of being able, by means of her father, to constrain Agnes to comply with his wishes, he had for some few days past rather contributed to retard the intended enterprise, that he might have time to effect this purpose. He knew the filial reverence and strong attachment of Agnes for her father. He considered him, therefore, as an engine in his hands, by which, with proper management, he could wield her determinations as he pleased. He had written to her, as we have seen, informing her that her father should receive good or had treatment, according as she complied or not with his wishes. The time in which, according to his calculations he should receive her answer, had elapsed on the day of Joseph Jennings' arrival at the tory encampment. No answer had arrived. But in this he scarcely felt disappointed. He was too well aware of her aversion to him, to have been very sanguine in his expectations of one, at least one satisfactory to his wishes. He considered that Agnes, knowing her father to be himself averse to her connexion with him, might suppose that her consent, even if she gave it, would not receive his sanction. To remove that obstacle, therefore, he determined either to persuade or compel his prisoner to exert his authority over her, and to write desiring her to yield to his wishes. It was his attempt to enforce such a letter from Mr. Norwood, that occasioned the altercation between them to which the sentinel alluded in his conversation with Joseph Jennings. The firmness of Mr. Norwood highly incensed him, and he did not refrain from the most vehement threats of vengeance. He, in fact, determined to commence a system of harshness and cruelty towards his prisoner, which he doubted not would compel him to purchase forbearance by compliance. His scheme, however, was frustrated by the event we have related, and, with a spirit animated to the utmost fury of revenge against all the whigs of Wyoming, he resolved to exert his whole influence in hastening forward the expedition now planned against them. A great council, composed of the Mohawk chiefs and the tory leaders, was held the day after Mr. Norwood's escape. This was the council alluded to by the sentinel Ephraim. It convened in the wigwam of Aranooko. Its object was to confirm the league between the Indians and the royalists, and make final arrangements relative to the marching of the intended expedition against the whigs of Wyoming. The sachem Aranooko presided at this assembly. Around the council-fire which was lighted in the centre of the wigwam, the chiefs and leaders arranged themselves. The calumet was smoked in silence, for some minutes, and the cup of hospitality pledged, in token of amity between the parties. Aranooko then addressed the tory leaders. “Brothers, I am glad to see you. Hearken to me. The council-fire is kindled that we may converse around it. The smoke of our calumets have mingled, and we are united—the festal cup has been pledged, and we are friends.— Every Mohawk says, let it be for ever. Brothers, what is your reply!” “For ever!” answered Butler and his coleagues. “Then take this wampum,” said the sachem, “and let the treaty be confirmed.” Butler received the wampum, and presented Aranooko with a handsome military sash in exchange. “The treaty is now confirmed,” continued Aranooko. “We are now the allies of the great king, your father, whose throne is fixed in chambers of the east—in the land of the morning sun. Your father is powerful. He is at a far distance. But he stretches his arm across the great deep, and our forests tremble at his strength. The winds of heaven have blown to this land the travellers of the sea that he has sent forth. They brought thunder with them, they shook the solidity of our shores, and at the glare of their lightning, heroes have turned pale. Thus mighty is your father. Yet he has children in this land, who fear not his power. They have united in strong bands against his faithful servants. They have spoken words of defiance—They have committed acts of rebellion. They are not worthy to be called children. “Brothers, your father wants to chastise his disobedient children. He asks us to aid him, and offers us rich rewards. We have agreed to his terms. Brothers, hear our reasons. “In the quarrel between your father and his disobedient children, we would have nothing to do, if those children did not deserve chastisement from our hands, as well as from his. They have usurped our lands—they have driven us from our hunting grounds. The wigwams of our fathers once covered the fair regions of the Merrimack, the Hudson, the Delaware, and the Susquehanna. Where are now those dwellings of the brave? They have vanished like the blossoms that are beautiful when fanned by the gale of spring, but that wither and fade away when the fierce summer bursts upon them with the relentless scorching of his beams. So have our people faded before the wrath of the children of your father. They would now destroy him also; and shall we not help to avenge his cause and our own? “Brothers, we grieve for the doom of our fathers. The recollection of their sufferings, makes our hearts ache. You invite us to revenge them. Can we refuse? When we look at ourselves, what do we see? The persecuted remnants of a mighty people. Our race was once like the stars of the heaven, numerous and bright in their glorious abodes—we are now like the glimmering meteors of the swamps and N solitudes, few and wandering, scattered by the winds of night, and extinguished by the beams of day. “Brothers, you offer us vengeance. Shall we not take it? Our wrath is awakened—our strength is revived. We have lifted the hatchet. We pant for the enemy. Let us hasten towards him, that we may scorch him with the fire that burns within us. “Brothers you have heard me.” Butler now rose and addressed the sachem. “Brother and chief, thy zeal delights me. The spirit that animates thee is worthy of the chief of the gallant Mohawks. Thou hast not degenerated from thy fathers, and thy fathers were heroes. They never shrunk from battle, although the death-winged thunder of artillery rolled in volumes of destruction against them. Their hearts were invincible, but their weapons were not formed of materials to combat with the deadly hail of the musketry, or the fiery bolts of the cannon of their adversaries. Yet they would not submit to the invaders. They could die but they could not yield. Hence were they swept from the land.—Ye are now, brave Mohawks, in the stead of your fathers. You are equally heroic. Their spirits, from their abodes in the land of bliss, will survey your exploits in the approaching war with delight. They will say to each other: `Our sons are heroes—they are mindful of our wrongs. See how they avenge us!' “Brother, thou hast said truly that our father, the great king beyond the ocean, is powerful. All parts of the world have seen the glittering of his arms, and heard the rolling of his thunder. His armies have conquered continents, and his navies have brought the islands into subjection. His rebellious children in this land, could soon be humbled by his power, and crushed in his wrath; but they have sought aid from his enemies, and have unnaturally thrown themselves into the arms of those who envy the power of their parent. Is their offence not heinous? Is it not aggravated beyond endurance? “Brother, those same disobedient people are your enemies. In this very neighbourhood, they have usurped the lands which were once yours, and they have given you no equivalent for the possession. The pleasant valleys on the Susquehanna are no longer yours. They have enclosed fields, built villages, and erected strong-holds on your hunting grounds. You are expelled from the heritage of your ancestors. You will now be avenged; you will soon repossess your own. Our great father, the king, invites you to accept of his assistance. He sends you arms and ammunition equal to those possessed by your enemies, and such as your fathers never had. With such means would your fathers not have conquered? Would they not have kept possession of their lands, and transmitted to you the inheritance of a great people? Your hearts answer, `yes.' “Brother, you will do no less than your fathers would have done. We will lend our aid. We will go forth jointly to conquest and revenge. We will avenge the wrongs of our father, though he is far distant. You will avenge those of your long-suffering race; and after the wreaths of victory shall decorate your brows, you will resume your station as a great and valiant people. “Brother, shall we march to-morrow? In three days we shall be upon the enemy. We shall take them by surprise, and they shall be easily overthrown. “Brother, it is my proposal that we delay not, lest our foes receive succour and be in a condition to give powerful battle on the field, or to entrench themselves securely in their strong-holds. “Brother, you have heard—what say you?” “My voice is for marching to-morrow by the dawn,” said Aranooko. “Father!” said Brandt, addressing the sachem, “My voice is the same. Shall I say that now the wish of my heart is accomplished, when I see a league formed against the spoilers of our people? No, until I behold a thousand of their scalps hanging around our wigwams, I shall not say so. But, father, I will say that I rejoice exceedingly at the prospect this treaty holds forth. It appears to me as the dawn of a triumphant and glorious day, which will not set until my soul shall be satisfied with the blood of my enemies. “Father, hear me. I am a Mohawk. When I was a boy some of my companions taunted me. They said that the blood of the pale-faced people ran in my veins—that my heart sided with the race of my father, and that the Mohawks should not confide in me. I then vowed to show to you all which side my heart preferred. Did I ever spare a white man in battle? Did I ever show mercy to a white prisoner? If so, let my mother's race disclaim me. But ye are all witnesses of the animosity with which I have pursued the white race, and how I have endeavoured to avenge the injuries they have inflicted on my red brethren, the people of my mother. “Father, I will tell you the reason. My mother was tender to my infancy. She cherished, she fed, she clothed me in my helpless N 2 years. I reverence her memory. I love her people. My father I never knew. He deserted me when I was feeble. He was unnatural, and left me to the protection of a forsaken woman. My mother had been his friend in distress. She nursed him in his sickness, and her caresses relieved the anguish of his mind. He was ungrateful. He was more unnatural than the rugged bear or the ferocious panther. They do not desert their young when it is helpless, and leave to its mother the sole charge of providing for it. My father did so. Can I love him? No; I grieve that my frame contains any portion of his blood. For his sake I detest his people.—Father, on my own account I detest them also. Have they not maltreated and imprisoned me, because I resented the insult of one of their rude tongues. I clove him down. I should have been applauded: but I was bound and thrown into a dark cell. My heart has panted for revenge! I demand of my white brother, that, when we gain the victory, he will allow me a thousand scalps of the prisoners over whose tortures I may exult, and enjoy a full banquet of vengeance.” “Let our white brother speak,” said Aranooko. “Brandt is brave. He will be the leader of our warriors. He will deserve his reward.” “I know the bravery of Brandt,” replied Butler. “I admire his zeal in behalf of his people. His desire of vengeance upon those who have injured him, is natural. I will not oppose it. Let it have its full swing upon the rebels of Wyoming. There are but two or three there whom I would save. I will name them to Brandt in secret. All others shall be at his disposal. Why should I wish to preserve rebels?—Will this satisfy my brother?” “I am satisfied,” said Brandt. “There is joy in my heart. I will have vengeance for the bonds that fettered my limbs; and for every hour of my imprisonment the scalp of a white man shall reward me!” “Let the first glance of the sun to-morrow upon our village, be the signal for marching!” said Aranooko. The chiefs signified approbation, and the council broke up, each man hastening to make arrangements for his departure the next morning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. Who that feels what love is here, All its falsehoods—all its pain, Would, for even Elysium's sphere, Risk the fatal dream again? Who, that 'midst the desert's heat, Sees the waters fade away, Would not rather die than meet Streams again as false as they? Moore. What a wayward and unaccountable passion is love! No strength of mind can resist it—no force of reasoning can control it. If it has once truly fixed upon the heart, what will remove it? Neither the coldness nor the unworthiness of its object. We may discover that our affections are misplaced—we may grieve, but we will continue to love. We may disapprove—we may condemn—we may even try to detest. But it will not avail. Our affections will cling to their chosen object, no matter how desperate the efforts we may make to separate them. The mention of a beloved name will excite tender emotions, although we know it to be the name of a wretch. We may abhor crime, yet we may love the criminal. Nay, we may receive injuries—ungenerous, base and cruel injuries—yet we may love the unkind being who inflicts them, and long to kiss the hand that consigns us to misery. Unfortunate, indeed, is the condition of those whose heart and understanding are thus at variance. Often does the struggle continue until the whole frame becomes agitated and convulsed, and sinks into despondency—despair—madness— death!—So true is the Greek adage which may be thus paraphrased: Not against hope alone, said mighty Jove, But against reason shall weak mortals love, Until the madd'ning strife exhausts the breath, And the torn victim finds repose in death. Isabella Austin still continued to love Butler even after his treacherous alliance with the savages became known. In spite of the exhortations and arguments of her friends—in spite of her own earnest desire to withdraw her affections from one so perfidious and wicked, her heart still clung to him. He was her first, her only choice among mankind. All her affections were entwined around his image, and she found it as impossible to dissever them as to separate sensation from her existence. Severely, indeed, did she feel his perfidy—deeply did she lament his turpitude. His attempt upon Miss Norwood, and his instrumentality in carrying off her father, greatly shocked her. She could offer no apology for him. She saw that he was not only a traitor but a ruffian; yet, though her esteem was gone, her love was not diminished; and no small portion of the agitation she experienced, when she heard of the late transaction, arose from the danger to which he had then been exposed. The outcry against him throughout the whole settlement was unanimous and great; and every day her ears were pained by accumulating intelligence of his flagitious acts and detestable projects. She brooded intensely and sorrowfully on the subject, until she became an object of pity to all her acquaintances, and of anxiety to her immediate friends. Miss Norwood and Miss Watson were her most intimate companions, and deeply did they sympathise with her. By every art that could be suggested by the tenderest friendship, they endeavoured to sooth her sorrows, and divert her mind from the unhappy subject of its contemplations. Books, music, short walks— for the times were too dangerous to admit long ones—and cheerful conversation, were the principal means resorted to, and they sometimes produced an apparently good effect. She felt grateful for the attention of these true friends, and seemed to derive enjoyment from their society. One evening as they sat in the porch of Dr. Watson's house, they observed two fowls fighting with great fury. “Alas!” said Isabella, “all animated nature seems to be imbued with contentious feelings. The propensity for mutual destruction is not confined to man. To be irritable and vengeful seems to be a law imposed, no doubt for wise ends, on all sentient beings!” “All sentient beings,” observed Agnes, “have impulses capable of being excited to either hatred or love, resentment or gratitude. The effects of hatred and resentment even in the inferior animals, it is unpleasant to behold; while those of love and gratitude are always delightful. How much more so in man! and endowed as he is with reason to see and appreciate the superior advantages of the latter, he is wonderfully inexcusable for not cultivating them attentively and indulging them exclusively.” “That men,” said Miss Watson, “with all their powers of calculation and foresight, should plunge, on account of any provocation, into the known miseries of war, seems to me not only inexcusable but unaccountable. The lower animals cannot estimate the extent of injury they may inflict on each other by yielding to the impulses of anger, and are, therefore, certainly not so culpable and absurd in their quarrels as men. Neither do the evils resulting from their combats ever extend so far. With the rational, and, therefore, less excusable beings, we frequently find the evils of contention almost unbounded in their extent, and shocking in their details. Plunder, devastation, and death inflicted in a thousand forms, and, alas! too often in the most cruel that can be devised, are the direful accompaniments—often the intended objects—of human warfare, for which, in my view, no justification nor apology can be offered.” “I do not wish to justify the wars waged by men from any example drawn from the brute creation,” said Isabella. “Alas! I have been too severely tried by the animosity existing among our race—our neighbours—our connexions—shall I say our friends!—ah! no; they are deceitful—false friends!—But such are mankind!—Can I justify them? No—no. In our present unhappy dissensions, my approbation may be entirely on one side; but there are those I dearly love embarked on both. Can I, without a bleeding heart, contemplate the strife of such, or wish either to be vanquished? My friends, you will forgive me if I wish safety to your most dreaded and detested enemy! Alas! is he not my own enemy? Yet does my heart bleed for him—cling to him—in spite of reason —in spite of duty—for, oh! I cannot control my heart. I ask you not to approve of me. I only ask you to pity and forgive me!” “Truly do we pity—sincerely do we forgive you,” said Miss Watson. “We know your affection for that man is involuntary. It is true love with which reason has nothing to do. It is the offspring of feeling alone. Happy, happy are they whose reason sanctions the impulse of their feelings!” At this moment their attention was directed to a man on horseback galloping swiftly towards the governor's house. They recognised him to be Joseph Jennings. Their hearts sunk within them, for something indescribable in his manner, as he past, told them that he was the bearer of alarming intelligence. In a short time, they perceived a crowd assembling about the governor's house, and were soon informed that the intelligence was indeed alarming. The combined forces of the tories and Indians had invaded the district. One of the remote forts situated about half a day's journey from the village, had already fallen into their hands, in their attack upon which they had slain nearly a hundred of the garrison, and after its surrender, had massacred the survivors consisting of about the same number. In a short time our trembling females received O a message from the governor, requiring them to retire into the adjoining fort, where all the women and children, and the aged and infirm inhabitants of the settlement, were hastening for protection. Mr. Norwood and Dr. Watson were the bearers of this message, and their companions to the only asylum that now remained against the advancing and ferocious foe. The habitations of Wyoming soon became totally deserted. The fort, although capacious, having in its construction been adapted for such an emergency, was incapable of affording accommodation to the great number that desired admission. Many were, therefore, obliged to fly to the wilds and mountains for safety. The nearest and dearest friends were thus separated, and the most heart-rending scenes of grief and distress were sorrowfully witnessed by the governor and the council, without it being in their power to relieve them. The fort was tolerably well calculated for defence. It was surrounded by a parapet about five feet high, outside of which was a ditch nearly as many feet deep, and more than twice as many wide. This ditch was, on the present occasion, filled with water brought to it by a channel purposely cut from the Sharon. It was entered by a wooden bridge or moveable platform which was susceptible of being drawn up against the gate of the parapet, so as in that place, to form no inconsiderable addition to its strength. The garrison consisted of about four hundred men, comprising nearly two-thirds of the armed strength of the whole settlement. The residue was scattered in various small bands, for the purpose of protecting the inhabitants in different parts of the district. One of these under Joseph Jennings, was particularly useful in defending those who were obliged to seek shelter in the mountains from marauding parties of the enemy. While engaged in this service, Joseph had the fortune to encounter the celebrated Brandt himself, and to rescue from his murderous hands, the venerable Hermit of the woods. The incident will be related in the next chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. There was a something in his look, Which the fell murderer's purpose shook; His words, mysterious, dark and strange, Had power the savage heart to change; Yet less the words impression made, Than the deep tone of what he said. Harley. It was about mid-summer in 1778, that the united force of the tories and Indians arrived at the most northern settlement in the valley of Wyoming. This place was defended by a garrison of about two hundred men, stationed in a fort, called Wintermoot, from a violent tory of that name, who had several months before made it the object of an attack, in which he was defeated. It was assailed now by an overwhelming force of nearly sixteen hundred tories and Indians, under the command of Butler and Brandt. The tories, who were commanded by Butler, formed the largest portion of this army, their number being about one thousand. The remainder consisted of the Mohawk warriors, who owned Brandt for their leader. On reaching the first settlement of the whites, they halted in order to perform some warlike ceremonies customary with the native tribes, on such occasions. The war-dance was accordingly performed, and the war-song chanted. The former being more grotesque than picturesque, would afford no pleasure in the description; the latter, which was wild in its structure and fierce in its sentiments, ran something in the following strain. INDIAN WAR SONG. Warriors! warriors! we are come To the field of blood; Warriors! warriors! we assume The fierce and vengeful mood! Remember the combats our fathers maintained So daringly, so daringly! O'er the red fields of slaughter their hot vengeance reigned Unsparingly, unsparingly! The sun of the summer burns fierce on the plain, The fire of our wrath in the battle shall glow;— The thunder of Heav'n shakes the land and the main, Our war-cry strikes dread to the heart of the foe! On, ye warriors, brave and bold! The foe is there—his ranks behold,— To death—to death devote them! Send their souls to howl in air; And let their writhing frames declare 'Twas vengeful arms that smote them! Warriors! now to us belongs To avenge the red-man's wrongs, To teach the spoilers of our race, The murderers of our sires, That strength does yet our sinews brace, That rage our hearts inspires!— O 2 There they are!—We'll spare them not! Our arms are strong, our rage is hot, Our aim is sure, and sharp our steel, Which soon their quivering flesh shall feel, As from their sculls we wrench away The trophies of this vengeful day! Warriors! warriors! we are come, To seal yon haughty white men's doom— Hark! our fathers from on high, Pronounce the mandate—“they shall die!” Haste then, the dread command obey!— Plunge—plunge into the deadly fray! Nor mercy ask nor give to-day! After the excitement of the bloody exhortations contained in these verses, it is not to be supposed that much mercy would be shown to the small garrison which was now attacked. The brave Wyoming soldiers, however, sold their lives dearly. Repeatedly did their well-aimed discharges of musketry from behind their ramparts, thin the ranks of the assailants and stagger the enthusiasm of their approach. But that enthusiasm, supported by the weight of their numbers, carried them forward to the gate of the ramparts, which soon gave way, and a thousand balls followed the flying garrison into their last refuge, a large log edifice inside of the entrenchment. Nearly one half of these brave men were slain; the rest surrendered at discretion, but were soon laid prostrate in the arms of death along side of their companions, and two hundred scalps collected together that evening in the tent of Brandt, formed the horrid trophies on which that monster feasted his fiendish imagination with intense delight. “Eight hundred more!” cried he, addressing himself to Butler, “and my revenge on Wyoming shall be satisfied!” “That will require the heads of nearly one-fourth of the population of the district!” replied his confederate in cruelty. “But no matter, you shall be gratified. The full complement shall, before many days, be meted out to you. Your valour deserves even a richer reward.” “What richer can I obtain?” asked Brandt, with fierce satisfaction gleaming in his burning eyes. “In the assemblies of my tribe, I will point to these trophies of my valour, and I will say, `Mohawks, behold how I have dealt with your enemies'—and they will answer, `Brandt deserves to be our leader in war, for he has overpowered the white men!”' That evening, while the victors, wearied out by their exertions during the fight, or their carousals afterwards, were mostly sunk in slumber, and the whole encampment had become hushed in comparative silence, Brandt, whose exultation of mind prevented him from sharing in the general repose, and who was also desirous to ascertain whether the sentinels were attentive to their duty, wandered for some time from station to station, indulging his delight in the present triumph, and regaling his imagination with the contemplation of others that he believed were speedily approaching. The evening was beautiful, and altogether free from that sultriness which frequently characterizes the evenings of July (for it was now the beginning of that month) in Pennsylvania. There was a magnificent serenity in the expansive brightness of the starry heavens, the majestic mildness of the modest moon, the sedateness of the lofty hills, the solid plain on which he trod, and the broad and quiet sheet of the Susquehanna that lay basking in the moonlight rays before him, that might have inspired even a savage with the love of tranquillity and peace. There was also inherent in the sublime grandeur of the scene, a mysterious power of impressing on the mind of the beholder, holy and solemn feelings and convictions relative to the great Author of all things, which might have imparted a sensation of humility even to the proud and stern heart of the triumphant Brandt, and softened his rugged temper, into, at least, a temporary feeling of kindness and benevolence toward his fellow men. But although he was impressed with no feeling of this nature, he was not altogether insensible to the beauty and blandness of the scene. These induced him to wander some distance from the fort, towards the bank of the river, in order that he might have a more perfect view of the silvery sheen of its broad bosom. As he approached the river, but while yet at some distance from it, he imagined that he beheld the figure of a man moving slowly amidst the trees near the bank. He advanced cautiously, and with that stealthy pace which the Indians, when requisite, can so readily adopt, for he wished not to frighten away the wanderer, whom he suspected to be a spy from the whig party, endeavouring to reconnoitre the state and position of his encampment. If so, as he was armed with a tomahawk, he determined to cut him down, and add one scalp more to the number of the day's trophies. If indeed he should be a white man, whether a spy or not, unless he belonged to Butler's party, he resolved that he should suffer the same fate. His quick eye soon discerned that the stranger was clothed, partly at least, in the Indian costume. This caused him to hesitate in his murderous intention, and he hailed the stranger in the Indian language. The latter was startled. He had evidently not hitherto observed the approach of Brandt. It was now too late to avoid an interview, even if he wished to do so, and he answered the salutation in the same language. Brandt now recognised the Hermit of the Woods. By information received from Butler, he knew that he had now in his power the person whose interference had occasioned the rescue of Miss Norwood and Miss Watson, and the death of three of his party in the Hemlock Glade. His first impulse was to sacrifice him to his vengeance. But reflecting that he was entirely in his power, he resolved to forbear, until he should show him how he had excited his resentment—for he knew that revenge is never so complete as when its victim is made conscious of his offence, and compelled by his sufferings or his fears to deplore having committed it. Indeed those who are epicures in the indulgence of that most savage and hellish of all passions, never wish the sufferings of their victim to be too suddenly terminated by his dissolution—for what gratification can vengeance derive when consciousness is gone and life extinct?—Besides, even before he received the information of the Hermit's agency in the transaction just mentioned, Brandt had partaken of the general reverence which was felt for the old man by the Mohawks, whose villages of late years he had frequently visited, and had to Brandt himself paid more than ordinary attention. It is true, he had sometimes wearied the stern savage by ineffectual attempts to restrain his impetuous temper and soften his ferocity. Brandt, although he disrelished those harangues, and improved nothing by them, could not but respect a man who took so much trouble to do him a service. Some sprinkling of this feeling, perhaps, on this occasion, mingled with his resentment, and contributed to produce the pause in his murderous design, which we have mentioned. “What brings thee here, old man,” said he, “prowling, at midnight like a beast of prey, on the skirts of a field of battle?” “I come,” said the Hermit, “to this scene of slaughter to discover if there is no wounded being lying neglected in its vicinity, to whom I may be of service.” “Thou mayest save thyself such trouble,” said Brandt. “Every thing human that, this morning, inhabited yon fort, has been subjected to the tomahawk.” “Then indeed I can render them no service!” ejaculated the Hermit. “Barbarous— barbarous Brandt!—But cruel as thou art, thou art even less so than he who bears the name of a Christian—was born among Christians—was educated in Christian principles—and yet has assisted thee in this butchery upon his own people.” “Beware old man,” exclaimed Brandt, “or thou mayest thyself become the victim of my resentment. My vengeance is not yet satisfied on the usurping race who have destroyed my fathers, and robbed their children of their hunting grounds!” “Thy fathers!”—interrupted Rodolph— “thy fathers were of the race on whom thou seekest vengeance. Unnatural man, leave the work of destroying white men to those who have none of their blood in their veins! Thou shouldst—” “Hold!” shouted the savage with a loud and fearful voice, “by Manetto, thou dost insult me! Seest thou this tomahawk! Is that the weapon of a white man? Seest thou the hand that grasps it, the eye that directs it, and the heart that dictates its use—Seest thou these? Do they belong to a white man? No—no— tremble—they belong to a Mohawk! One who has sworn vengeance on all thy race; and who grieves that his blood is tainted with theirs. One who has sworn vengeance on thyself, for thou hast done him an injury not to be forgiven —thou hast caused the destruction of three of his mother's kindred!” “Brandt!” said the Hermit, in a fearless tone that surprised the savage, “Brandt, what meanest thou? Thy charge I comprehend not. —But let me tell thee, I fear neither thy barbarous weapon, thy blood-stained arm, thy ferocious eye, nor thy savage heart. Weaponless as I am, I dare defy thee. But explain thy charge. What kindred of thy mother have I destroyed?” “One word will explain it,” said Brandt, somewhat disconcerted by the manner of the Hermit, “the Hemlock Glade!—All the people of my tribe are the kindred of my mother!” The Hermit now clearly comprehended the charge; but he shrunk not from meeting it. “Ha!” said he, “I might have been assured that thy companion in atrocity would have informed thee of that. I did my duty then. I saved innocence from misery, and thee from additional guilt. Yet I lifted not my hand against thee. Dost thou wish that thou hadst disgraced thy manhood by the murder of women?” “They were our captives, old man,” said Brandt; “what we should have done to them would have been determined by our chiefs. But the death of my companions must be avenged. Thou wert the cause—thou must die!” As Brandt prepared to strike, the Hermit, starting back a few paces, drew himself up to a P greater height than usual, and assumed an air and attitude of majesty that seemed for a time to hold the savage spell-bound. “Brandt, beware!” he exclaimed, “Heaven looks upon thee!—No—no, thou darest not strike to injure this time-worn frame. The spirits that inhabit the orbs which shine above us would see thee and shudder, for it would be a deed of guilt surpassing whatever thou hast yet committed. Return to thy camp, nor pollute the earth with such a crime. Thou knowest not whom thou wouldst slay.” “Who art thou? strange man,” said Brandt in a subdued tone. “Art thou not Rodolph of the woods?” “I am Rodolph of the woods,” replied the Hermit; “and I am one whose fate is so closely connected with thine, that if thou darest to strike me, with the blow thou wilt seal thy own perdition. The laws of the universe have given me a control over thee from which thou canst not escape, but of which, at present, thou knowest nothing.” “Thou speakest mysteries, old man!” returned Brandt. “By Manetto, I do not believe thy words. Thou wouldst mock me—thou wouldst frighten me.—Ha! thou shalt not.— What care I for thy fancied control. Vain dreamer, thy silly device will not serve thee. I must have revenge for my slaughtered friends— and now thou diest!” “I die not now. Heaven prevents thy wickedness!” said the Hermit. Brandt replied not; but uttered an imprecation which he intended should be followed by the stroke of death. Immediately his weapon was raised in air, but as it descended, it was grasped firmly by an unseen hand, and rendered powerless. The Hermit then seized it, wrested it from him, and flung it afar into the Susquehanna. “Untameable savage!” he cried, “return to thy companions, I command thee; and thank Heaven that thou hast been prevented from committing the most terrible of crimes.” Brandt, awe-struck and yet enraged, was about to answer, when an unknown voice exclaimed “Obey!” and at the same instant, a large pistol was presented to his breast by the hand that had lately grasped him so firmly. He instinctively started back, muttered a curse upon his ill-fortune, and fled. “It would be right to shoot him,” said the person who held the pistol; and he was about performing what he said, when the Hermit prevented him by exclaiming— “Oh! spare him! for my sake, spare him!” “For your sake, then, let him go in safety, this time,” said Joseph Jennings, for it was he who had come so opportunely to the Hermit's assistance. “But I fear,” added he, “that we shall all have reason to repent this lenity.” “Alas! I also fear it,” said the Hermit, sorrowfully; “but, Joseph, you know my reasons. I thank you for respecting my feelings, and for your timely interference to-night. Let us trust the future to the goodness of the Great Being, whose hand has so evidently appeared in what has just taken place. But we must now haste from hence, lest the implacable Brandt return to assail us with a force we shall not be able to withstand.” Joseph's small party of bush-rangers, as they were called, were stationed in a valley about a mile distant. Thither they bent their course, and soon joined them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. Last noon beheld them full of lusty life, Last eve in beauty's circle proudly gay, The midnight brought the signal sound of strife, The morn the marshalling in arms—the day Battle's magnificently-stern array! The thunder-clouds close o'er it, which when rent, The earth is covered thick with other clay Which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent Rider and horse—friend, foe—in one red burial blent. Byron. The next day was one of terrible importance to the people of Wyoming. It brought against them the combined forces of their unfeeling enemies. Flushed with victory, and breathing denunciations of desolation and ruin on the hitherto flourishing settlements of this fair valley, the fierce Mohawks and merciless tories, swept along in their march from the fort of Wintermoot to that of Wyoming, without meeting any opposition. The country indeed was deserted before them. Men, women and children,—the cattle, and all kinds of easily transported property, had been hurried off to places of security. In their hasty flight, however, the fugitives had unavoidably left much valuable property behind. This, it is not to be supposed, was spared by the invaders. Every dwelling was pillaged, and whatever could not be removed or was not thought worthy of removal, was destroyed. The plundered P 2 houses were subjected to the flames, and even the fences of the fields were vengefully and wantonly demolished. At length the drums and trumpets of the tories, and the terrifying war-whoop of the savages, were heard by the garrison of Wyoming, and the alarmed multitude of women, children, aged and infirm under its protection. Every disposition that judgment and zeal could suggest towards an effective defence was adopted by the Governor and his military coadjutor Colonel Dennison. Their men were divided between them, and each took his station at a separate wing of the entrenchment, in order to repel the enemy from whatever part it should be assaulted. Upon two sides only could the fort be easily attacked, and to these was the defence now chiefly directed. The assailing force was also divided into two bodies, the savages and the tories, being ranged under their respective leaders, Brandt and Butler. The tories were the first that made the assault. They advanced toward the moveable bridge, but found that it was drawn up against the gate of the parapet. They retired, and in the course of half an hour constructed a frame of light timber. This they intended to throw over the ditch which was now full of water. In approaching to make the attempt they were saluted with such an effective volley of musquetry from the Governor's division that they could not accomplish their design. They withdrew, greatly chagrined, with the loss of nearly a hundred men. In the meantime the savages had dragged forward, as near to the fort as they could with safety approach, a large quantity of rubbish and timber torn from the houses of the village, in order to fill the ditch in a quarter where they thought the entrenchment assailable. But here they also met with such a warm reception from the walls as obliged them to desist, after the destruction of about fifty of their warriors. Butler and Brandt now held a consultation. “These pale-faced rebels,” said the latter, “fight like furies. How shall we penetrate their strong-hold? To approach it on any side is destruction.” “It is an unexpected resistance,” said Butler. “We must use artifice. Let us withdraw our men from the reach of danger, and then deliberate.” The attack was suspended, and the chiefs conferred together. “The rebels manage their affairs better than I expected,” said Butler. “They know the strength of their position, and they have availed themselves of it with much spirit. It is in vain to exert our force against them while thus sheltered. We cannot reach their ramparts, otherwise we might scale them. But our musketry produces on them no effect, while theirs, whenever we approach near enough thins our ranks in the most murderous manner. Cannon we have none. If we had, the state of affairs would be different,—this consultation would not be required. We have the choice of two measures—to besiege, and endeavour to starve them into a surrender, or to allure them out of their strong-hold either by fair promises or pretended flight. Which shall we adopt?” “A siege is tedious,” replied Brandt. “I love action. My heart rejoices in the excitement of strife. But flight is shameful. Are we vanquished that we must leave the field to the victors?” “No,” said Butler. “We are not vanquished. We shall not fly—we shall only retire to a better position. I dislike the tediousness and dulness of a siege as much as thou. The delay might frustrate all our designs. The rebels are in daily expectation of succours from their great army. We must subdue them soon, and possess their fortified places, or we shall not be able to withstand the force that may be sent against us. A siege, therefore, will not answer. But, brother, are thy people not expert at stratagems? Do ye not love the animating variety of dextrous manœuvres, ambuscades, rapid marches, surprises and sudden actions in war? Are such not the favourite pastimes of true warriors, who shun no toil and dread no danger?” “Brother,” replied Brandt, “thou art skilful. Thou hast spoken truth. My people glory in the manœuvres of war. The rapid march, the silent ambush, and the clamorous battle are changes that delight them. Exert thy wisdom—let thy cunning dictate. I and my people will obey thee.” Butler being satisfied with this assurance, took his measures accordingly. He first sent a message to the garrison summoning it to surrender, offering them terms more favourable than he had any intention of fulfilling. The Governor was inclined to accede to these terms; but the other leaders were averse to them, and he was overruled. They insisted that it would be folly to trust to the professions of so treacherous a character as Butler, whom no treaties could bind. Besides, the terms now offered being only personal safety, and the guarantee of certain property under the obligation of never again resisting British authority, were such as became conquerors only to propose to the vanquished. But their enemies were not conquerors; nay, thus far, they were themselves the victors in the strife. In fine, the terms were rejected, and Butler hastened to adopt other measures. During the attack which had taken place, Mr. Norwood, who was entrusted with the maintenance of quiet and regularity in the interior of the barracks, where those unfit to assist in the defence were collected, had found abundant exercise for all his fortitude as a man and his influence as a divine. The ferocity of the Indian character, had, by the repetition of a thousand tales, made a deep impression on the minds of the women and children. The very name of Brandt was terrifying to them. It was connected in their minds with all that was terrible in savage cruelty or dreadful in human suffering. Nor was the name of Butler, at this time, much less appalling than that of his barbarous confederate. The atrocities committed under his sanction at fort Wintermoot had struck them with dismay, for they felt that if they should fall into his hands, they might expect nothing but a similar fate. Lamentations and cries, and prayers to Heaven for protection, filled every apartment occupied by these unfortunate people, during the whole continuance of the firing produced by the action that had taken place. In the work of consolation and encouragement, Mr. Norwood was zealous and active, and he had two assistants whose zeal and activity were little inferior to his own. These were his daughter and her friend Mary Watson. Their own hearts were torn with anxiety and terror. But they lost not their presence of mind. They concealed the agitation which they could not overcome; and, hastening from one group to another of their terrified companions, they soothed their alarms and diffused among them at least a portion of that courage which they themselves so nobly exerted. As soon as the firing ceased, and it was ascertained that their enemies were beaten off, the joy and gratitude which pervaded all hearts were equal to the alarm and despair they had before experienced. Praises and blessings, loudly expressed and earnestly felt, were showered upon their brave defenders. Mothers pressed their sons to their bosoms, daughters their fathers, sisters their brothers, and wives their husbands, with all that ecstacy of delight and thankfulness with which they would have hailed their restoration from the dead. After the first ebullition of joy had subsided, and tranquillized feelings permitted their thoughts to arise to the Author of all good, Mr. Norwood assembled them in the open space between the barrack and the ramparts, and publicly offered up to Heaven grateful acknowledgments for the protection they had experienced, and earnest entreaties, if it were consistent with the Divine will, that it might be continued until their enemies should no longer seek their destruction. Intelligence that their enemies were retiring from before the fort, soon added to their satisfaction. Scouts were despatched to watch the proceedings, and if possible ascertain the intensions of the retiring foe. It was in a short time ascertained that the tories and the Indians had separated, and marched off in different directions. Many supposed or rather hoped, from this circumstance, that some misunderstanding had arisen between these confederates, and if so, that the enterprises of either against their settlement, if continued, would be easily resisted and overthrown. While the minds of the people, in the fort, were occupied with these and other conjectures relative to the present aspect of their affairs, one of the scouts who had been taken prisoner by the tories, and was released by the order of Butler, after experiencing from the latter much unexpected kindness, returned to the garrison. He reported to the Governor that Butler was heartily tired of his alliance with the Indians, on account of their ferocious cruelty at Fort Wintermoot, as well as the general obstinacy of their character, which prevented him from being able to restrain their excesses, or even to direct their military force to any useful purpose. The scout also stated, that besides giving him this information, Butler had requested him to acquaint the Governor of Wyoming with his desire to enter into arrangements by which their differences might be reconciled, and peace restored to the settlement. What we ardently wish to be true, we are extremely ready to believe. The Governor was, therefore, much disposed to credit this statement of his kinsman's wishes. There were, notwithstanding the known perfidy of Butler's character, many circumstances which countenanced the supposition that he was sincere in this instance. The scout, who had conversed with him, seemed fully convinced of his sincerity.—It was believed that he had witnessed cruelties enough to render him sick of such scenes; he had been worsted in his attempt upon their fort, and might begin to feel hopeless of success in his designs; and above all, he had found his savage allies so intractable that he had been obliged to separate from them. Why might he not, therefore, be desirous of a reconciliation Q with his former friends who had treated him with much kindness, and with whom he had lived in tranquillity and ease. These reasons operated on the minds of many besides the Governor. But Mr. Norwood, Colonel Dennison, and Dr. Watson, placed no confidence in them. They expressed their conviction that the professions of Butler were totally false, and that they were intended merely as a lure to facilitate the execution of some stratagem, against which it would be proper diligently to guard. They, however, believed that, with due vigilance, his sincerity might be put to the test, without any risk on their part. Since so many of their friends, therefore, were desirous to open the door for a reconciliation, which might put an end to such a barbarous and unnatural war, they would throw no opposition in the way of any prudent and honourable effort to effect so desirable an object. But they trusted that if a negociation were opened with the tories while they continued to form an armed force, the utmost circumspection should be used to prevent any surprise, or the gaining of any undue advantage in a military respect, by enemies so unprincipled and unfeeling. It was, at length, determined that the same individual who made the report relative to Butler's wishes, should return to him and ascertain on what terms he would disband his forces and accept of the forgiveness and friendship of the people of Wyoming, who were, even yet, willing to overlook all his hostility, and restore to him their former protection and kindness. The messenger soon returned with Butler's answer, which was, that if the Governor and any number of his friends would meet him at an appointed place, they would confer together, and, no doubt, speedily agree upon terms. This reply was certainly vague and unsatisfactory. It strengthened the doubts of those who had suspicions of Butler's intentions. Why should he want the Governor and his friends to leave their place of security, and meet him in a situation where, it was evident they could have no other guarantee for their safety than his word. Was it not mockery in him to pretend that he expected they would rely on the promise or the honour of one who had already so egregiously deceived them, and had proved so bitterly their enemy? Yet the fond hope of bringing the distressing state of their affairs to a termination could not be slightly abandoned, and some risk might well be incurred for the attainment of such an object. It was therefore agreed that the Governor, Colonel Dennison, and Mr. Austin, should proceed to the place appointed. But as it was thought imprudent for them to go without protection, they were accompanied by upwards of three hundred and fifty men well armed, comprising, with the exception of about sixty soldiers, the whole force of the garrison. The fort was entrusted to the care of Dr. Watson and Mr. Norwood, the former being invested with the military, and the latter, if we may so term it, with the civil command which required the performance of but few more duties than he had hitherto discharged. The Governor and his party marched out of the fort in high hopes and joyous spirits, anticipating a speedy and prosperous return with their repentant and submissive enemy. When they had proceeded nearly a mile, they perceived the enemy's flag about a furlong before them at a bend of the road. They hastily pushed forward in order to overtake it; but it receded as they advanced, continuing for a considerable time at nearly the same distance from them, without any accompanying force in view, even he, who bore it, being but seldom visible. At length it stopped at the entrance of a defile. Colonel Dennison, who strongly suspected treachery, had just advised the Governor to follow, what he called a deluding meteor, no further. The Governor was about taking his advice, and retracing his steps to the fort, when the stationary appearance of an unprotected hostile flag at such a short distance from him, induced him to advance toward it. When the Wyoming party reached the entrance of the defile, the flag suddenly disappeared. But further in advance a white flag was perceived, which soon began to approach. They awaited its arrival. The man who carried it stated, that Butler felt unwilling to subject himself to the hazard of an interview with the Governor while attended by so large a party of armed men personally hostile to him. He proposed that, if the Governor would select five or six of his friends, Butler would select the same number of his own, and attended by these only, they should meet at the bottom of a high cliff which he pointed out about a quarter of a mile further up the defile. In spite of the remonstrances of Colonel Dennison, the Governor agreed to this proposal. He left his men in charge of the Colonel, and accompanied by Mr. Austin and five others, proceeded to the place appointed. Butler, with a small party, had reached the ground a few minutes before them. They had scarcely met, when the latter retired suddenly from the group, and sounded a small horn. Instantly a band of about twenty men, who had been concealed in an adjoining hollow, rushed Q 2 upon the Governor and his friends. They made a brave resistance until four of them were killed, among whom was Mr. Austin. The Governor and another named Dorance, who held the rank of captain, were taken prisoners. But the latter was so badly wounded that he died shortly afterwards. On perceiving the attack thus treacherously made upon their friends, Colonel Dennison and his whole force hastened forward to rescue them or avenge their fate. They had proceeded but a short way, when they perceived at some distance up a narrow rugged ravine in the hill on their right, a flag which they conceived to be the fatal one that had decoyed them into this snare; but their anxiety to save their friends, whose lives were, before their eyes, so perfidiously assailed, induced them to hurry forward without stopping to revenge the injury it had done them. So rapid indeed was their approach that they succeeded in rescuing the Governor; his assailants hastily disappearing behind the rock at the base of which the assault had taken place. On advancing to this spot, however, the Wyoming soldiers were struck with consternation to behold the whole tory force issuing from the midst of a dark glen, to attack them. They had scarcely time to form their ranks, which had been broken by the rapidity of their advance, when their hearts were appalled by the sound of the dreadful savage war-whoop, which awoke the trembling echoes of the hills behind them. They turned, and saw the ferocious warriors of Brandt rushing impetuously forward to attack them. These savages had been lying in ambush in the defile where the Wyoming troops, on passing to the aid of the Governor, saw the flag which they supposed had ensnared them into their present appalling situation. Appalling, indeed, was that situation. A well armed band of royalists, at least three times their number, was close upon them on the one side, while an infuriate force of red warriors had already attacked them on the other. There was little time for deliberation, but what there was, the Governor and Colonel Dennison improved to the best advantage. Their force was divided into two parties. The Governor, at the head of the one which was somewhat most numerous, waited the onset of the tories, while Dennison led the other to attack the savages. The Governor had not to wait long. In a few minutes, a volley from the tories levelled about one fourth of his party to the earth. Their companions, however, avenged them by a destructive fire upon the assailants, which for some moments checked their approach. But it was only for some moments; for soon an overwhelming torrent of bayonets rushed into the midst of their ranks, and consigned them to one general doom— indiscriminate, unsparing destruction. Cries for quarter—entreaties for mercy, addressed by name to those who had received kindness, many and great, from the imploring victims, were totally disregarded on this dreadful day, by men who had hearts harder than tigers and more unnatural than fiends. Scarcely a remnant of the Governor's party escaped this terrible slaughter. He himself, for some time, fought bravely, and brought several of his assailants to the ground. He soon, however, perceived all to be lost in this quarter, and hastened with about thirty men, who followed him, to reinforce Colonel Dennison, who was making head gallantly against the Indians. On reaching the Colonel's party, the governor exclaimed— “All's lost above—the tories have slaughtered our friends; they are hastening upon ourselves. Our only chance is, with desperation, to cut our way through the midst of the savages. On! my brave men! and as many as survive, fly to the fort, lest it, too, fall into the hands of the unmerciful!” Dashing on, he lead the way. Colonel Dennison followed, and their whole band rushed to the same point. The astonished savages were either overthrown or fell back before them. But the inveterate and victory-flushed tories were dealing death upon their rear, and the thunder of the savage rifles, rolling upon them from all directions, also dealt destruction at every step. About forty only succeeded in escaping from this fatal defile. They hastened to the fort; the sad remnant of that gallant band of nearly four hundred patriot soldiers who had so recently left it in sanguine hopes and joyous spirits.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. Auria's self is now but one wide tomb For all its habitants—what better grave? What worthier monument?—Oh, cover not Their blood, thou earth! nor ye, ye blessed souls Of heroes and of murdered innocents, O never let your everlasting cries Cease round th' eternal throne, till the Most High For all these unexampled wrongs, hath given Full, overflowing vengeance. Southey. Alas! how horror-struck were the disconsolate inhabitants of Wyoming, when the melancholy relics of their late band of brave defenders returned to that fortress which was now their last asylum. Where were now the near and dear relatives, the fathers, sons, brothers, husbands and lovers, to whom so many heartfelt thanks had that morning been given, and for whom so many earnest prayers had been offered? Ye bereaved mothers, and ye orphans and ye widows, cold now are the manly hearts that, but a few hours since, beat so warmly to your ardent pressure; and those ears which drank in, with so much rapture, the glowing praises and fervent blessings which ye showered upon them, are now deaf to all sounds. From neither friendship nor love can those clay-cold bosoms, late so generous and joyous, now experience any pleasing emotion. The blooming cheek is now pale; the sparkling eye is dim; motionless is the heart of ardour, and nerveless is the arm of strength. And ye survive those dear objects! Alas! unhappily for yourselves, ye survive them. Ye are in sorrow; ye are miserable. Sorrow can approach them no more. Their trials are over; they are happy! Yes, they are all happy; for the barbarity of their foes has not permitted a wounded one to survive—the work of death has been carefully, coolly, and effectually accomplished upon them all. Oh! ye mourners, do your hearts long for the same fate! Alas! what is life, when those who constituted its charm are no more? And within the walls of the fort of Wyoming many a heart, during that dismal night, (for night had now come on,) would have given a sincere welcome to the blow of the Indian tomahawk or the thrust of the tory bayonet which would have terminated their grief, and sent them to join, in the realms of spirits, the beloved ones of whom they had been so cruelly bereaved. Colonel Dennison was now invested with the command of the small garrison, whose task it was to defend the fort and preserve from destruction the hundreds of helpless and innocent beings who had made it their place of refuge. The governor, on escaping from the fatal defile, had refused to enter the fort. “You are,” said he to Colonel Dennison, “better fitted for the command than I. My unhappy credulity has been the sole cause of the terrible disaster that has befallen my friends. I am mortified; I am grieved almost to heart-breaking, to think of the fatal infatuation which induced me, in spite of your judicious counsel, to place confidence in the assurances of a wretch so perfidious, so utterly wicked. I will not enter the fort. I could not look upon the faces of those whom my obstinate folly has reduced to such a state of danger and distress. Your coolness, your wisdom, your intrepidity will do more to save them, if there is yet for them any means of safety, than any power or effort of mine. Yet I will not desert their cause; I will hasten to the districts on the Delaware. I will implore the people there to hurry to your aid; and, if I cannot succeed, I will fly to the camp of Washington himself, and entreat assistance. Alas! it may then be too late to assist you. But if so, I will avenge you—God protect and bless you!” said he; and the tears rushed to his eyes, as he shook Colonel Dennison by the hand. He then mounted a horse which was brought to him from the fort, and rode off. The tories and their allies did not advance towards the fort that evening. They had, during the day, performed abundance of fatiguing work. Besides the labour of the severe battle they had fought, they had gone through the barbarous toil of despatching the wounded and despoiling the dead, upon all of whom the scalping-knife had performed its horrid office, and the diabolical Brandt added, that day, the integuments of more than three hundred human heads to the number of his former trophies of conquest and massacre. They encamped in the vicinity of the fatal field, and after their customary carousal in celebration of victory, they sunk exhausted into a supine and heavy state of repose. But the garrison of the fort was too weak, and, perhaps, too much disheartened to take advantage of this defenceless condition of the enemy. This melancholy night was spent by Agnes Norwood in a state of the most intense and restless anxiety. At the first intelligence of the disasters of the day, poignant grief overcame every other feeling. But the exhortations of her father, and the exemplary fortitude of Mary Watson, contributed much to restore her to a state of pious submission to the awful dispensation that had taken place; and although the terrors of destruction seemed to accumulate so thickly around her, as to exclude from her view every hope of deliverance, R yet she would not resign herself to despair nor withdraw her confidence in the overruling goodness of the Most High. Her attention was, indeed, soon so entirely absorbed by the wretchedness of her friend Isabella Austin, the only sister of her Henry, who, on first hearing of the death of her father, became so overpowered with grief, that she had to be carried, in a state of insensibility, to her bed-chamber. When she recovered from this, she wept bitterly for some time, and then relapsed into stupefaction. Towards the morning, she was seized with several fits of frenzy, during which she frequently exclaimed, that she beheld the ungrateful Butler in the act of murdering her father! “Ha!” she would cry, “see, see! oh! save him! The horrid steel pierces his heart. Ungrateful Butler! He was your best friend. How could you do such a deed! Oh! for my sake, could you not have spared him!” She would then laugh deliriously, and sink again into stupefaction. Agnes and Miss Watson became alternately the nurses of the poor sufferer, and in the intensity of her grief, almost forgot their own. The morning arose with the brightness usual in July. The night-clouds fled, and the advancing sun came forward joyously and in smiles, as if he were that day to witness no scene of calamity and suffering on the earth which he illuminated. Colonel Dennison, at an early hour, mustered the whole strength of his garrison, and found that it scarcely numbered a hundred men. This was but a small force, with which to contend against that which he expected soon to assail him. They were zealous, however, and determined to defend the place to the last extremity. To propose a capitulation, they knew to be folly. The garrison of Fort Wintermoot they remembered, had received to the request which they made to Butler to be informed of what treatment they might expect if they surrendered, the reply which has since become so famous for its laconic ferocity of “the hatchet!” Their prospects of making a successful defence were, it is true, hopeless. But making such defence would not render their fate more certain or more severe. Massacre would inevitably follow submission; nothing worse could follow resistance. Besides, in resistance there was one chance; that of protracting their fate, until, perhaps, the succour which was daily expected, might arrive. This, indeed, was literally a forlorn hope. Their utmost efforts could not be supposed capable of resisting the force of their numerous enemies for many hours. They were, however, too brave to despair; and with the firmness of devoted martyrs, they calmly awaited the approach of the expected foe. How terrible to the reflecting mind is such an interval of suspense! In the hurry of battle there is an excitement of mind which silences the emotions of fear; and nerves which, in moments of tranquillity, would tremble at the contemplation of approaching doom, in the actual struggle with that doom, become animated to a defiance, and indurated to an endurance of its uttermost extremity. At length the music of warlike instruments, floating at first so weakly as scarcely to seem to agitate the distant air, became every moment louder and louder, until the neighbouring woods shook, and the walls of the fort itself reverberated with the sounds. The blood-stained banner of toryism soon appeared issuing from the surrounding forest; and Butler and Brandt, with the whole strength of their sanguinary followers, drew up before the devoted fort, which they soon made arrangements to attack. The fire of the small garrison succeeded for some time in keeping the assailants at a respectful distance. But it was not sufficient long to guard the entrenchments at every point from numbers so superior. A party of the tories succeeded in filling the ditch, near its northern angle, with rubbish, which rendered it passable. In various other places repeated attempts to accomplish the same object had been made by the besiegers, which were foiled by the unremitting exertions of the garrison. To the place which was now rendered passable, the assailants soon directed their chief efforts. The garrison rushed to prevent their wall from being scaled there. The besiegers drew back. But many other points being now undefended, at several of them the trench was also soon rendered passable. At one of these, Butler resolved to make an effective attempt, cost what it would, to scale the walls, and take the place by storm. As he was leading on a choice body of men for this purpose, his attention and the attention of all, both in and out of the garrison, were suddenly attracted to an apparition upon the rampart opposite to him, of a beautiful young woman with her white garments flowing loosely around her, her dark brown hair streaming wildly in the air, her face pale, her eyes rolling, and her hands stretched towards Heaven. It was Isabella Austin. She had unexpectedly rushed from her chamber, and with the energy and fleetness of a maniac, while the attention of her friends was directed towards the advancing foe, she ascended the parapet, R 2 looked wildly around her—then fixing her view upon Butler, she exclaimed: “Ha! he is there! Heaven, have mercy! a murderer!—my beloved—did ye not know I loved you? Yet ye killed him! My father —Oh! Heaven, think of the deed! The old man was kind.—Ha!—the thunderbolt! it has struck my brain. Terrible man! thou art accurst. My love will not save thee. Fiends! fiends!—yes, there he is—he is a murderer— Oh! God! must I fly to the arms of a murderer!” Uttering the last words, she sprang from the wall towards Butler, and as she descended, a random ball—for even this heart-rending spectacle had not produced an entire cessation of the firing—passed through her heart. An exclamation of horror burst from the defenders of the fort. One volley they fired with desperate precision upon their enemies, which levelled about fifty of them to the ground. But it was their last volley. Before they could reload, Butler and his inhuman followers were within the ramparts, furiously employed in the work of destruction. Butler, in the midst of this affray, became anxious to obtain possession of Agnes, lest she might fall a victim to the savages, who he knew, had resolved on a general massacre, and who were now surmounting the entrenchments in all directions. Seeing Colonel Dennison engaged with a soldier, he ordered the latter to desist. “Your life, Colonel,” said he, “shall be granted on one condition. You see it is useless to resist. Let me have your sword.” “Name your condition first,” said the Colonel. “It must be such as an honourable man can accept, or I shall die sword in hand.” “It is only to lead me to Mr. Norwood and his daughter, that I may save them,” said Butler. “No time is to be lost—the Indians may in another moment, defeat my intention.” “You are right,” replied Dennison. “I surrender—take my sword—follow me!” In a few moments they had penetrated the mingled mass of destroyers and victims, and reached the chamber where Mr. Norwood and his daughter,and Dr. Watson and his sister, were calmly awaiting that expected death which they were determined to share together. On entering the apartment, Butler, looking at Agnes, exclaimed, “I am fortunate!—You are yet safe. But you must be taken hence. These walls are doomed to destruction!” He then called, from the window, to Bateman, one of his partizans, who has been already mentioned as enrolling the tories in the Hemlock Glade, to bring forward the company he commanded. He was speedily obeyed. “Captain Bateman,” said he, “here are five prisoners. Their safety is of importance to me. I charge you with it. Conduct them to Mr. Norwood's house. I will join you there as soon as our business here is completed.” Agnes and Miss Watson, Mr. Norwood, Dr. Watson, and Colonel Dennison, were thus snatched, like brands from amidst a mass of flaming destruction, by the influence which the charms of the former had over the savage heart of a ruffian who was destitute of every other tender feeling save that of love.—Love! ah! no—let not the name of the sweetest and purest, and most disinterested of feelings be profaned by being applied to the gross and selfish, and sensual passion which actuated the heart of Butler the destroyer of Wyoming A detailed description of the terrible carnage that was now committed on the defenceless inmates of the fort, by the merciless victors of this bloody day, would present too horrible a picture of human suffering and human depravity, to be endured by any reader of sensibility. The monster Brandt seemed to be in his natural element, when wading through the currents of fresh-flowing blood that filled the yard of the fortress which was made the butchering place of the victims. As each victim received the mortal stroke, he rushed upon the body, while yet writhing in the agonies of death, and with his own knife dissected, with a fiendish delight, from the warm skull, the scalp which added one more trophy to those horrid memorials of vengeful victory of which he was so proud. The number of these memorials to which he had limited his ambition was on this occasion completed. “I have now a thousand scalps!” said he to Butler. “I have had a full harvest of revenge. The people of my tribe will extol me. I shall be called Brandt the successful—the destroyer of white men!—I am satisfied!” The carnage being over, the dead were stripped of every thing valuable. They were then dragged into the principal building of the fort, which after being pillaged, was set on fire along with the adjoining edifices. The smoke and flames soon ascended to the clouds, and struck new terror into the hearts of the disconsolate prisoners at Mr. Norwood's; for too well they knew that the awful conflagration which they beheld was the funeral pile of slaughtered hundreds of their friends and neighbours.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. If she will smile I'll woo her like the dove, Soft, fond and tender every word shall be; But should she frown repulsive on my love, The tiger's amorous rage shall reign in me; Horror and dread shall drive her to my arms, And with infuriate love, I'll seize upon her charms. Harley. Butler did not interrupt the sorrowful meditations of Agnes for that night. He wished to render himself as little odious to her as possible. By treating her and her friends with kindness and delicacy, he hoped to remove her unfavourable impressions of him, and in some degree, at least, ingratiate himself into her esteem. The vehemence of his passion, however, would not permit him long to defer his attempts to gain her to his purpose. He visited her the next day. “Miss Norwood,” said he, “I truly rejoice that you and your father were yesterday rescued from the unsparing hands of the savages. This is twice I have had the happiness of rendering you such service. May I claim some portion of gratitude for my efforts?” “If your general conduct were such,” said she, “as to warrant my yielding you any esteem, I would freely acknowledge gratitude. For the particular services of which you speak, however, receive my thanks. But beware lest you conceive them to be thanks accompanied by any other feeling than horror at the numberless deeds of cruelty of which you have been guilty.” “My fair reprehender,” he replied, “thou only utterest such sentiments as I expected. Thy reproach, therefore, does not offend me. But dost thou not consider the circumstances that have influenced my conduct, and, in spite of myself, compelled me to act as I have done. My conscience is hostile to the rebel cause. My father was murdered by the whigs. I was denounced by them. I fought them often. I have triumphed over them, and been triumphed over by them. They have put me into prison; they have doomed me to death. How I was rescued thou hast heard.” “Ha! ungenerous man!” said she, interrupting him, “the faithful maid to whom thou didst owe thy rescue, has been killed by thy cruelty. Thou didst desert her; she pined in secret, but reproached thee not. At length, her reason gave way before the pressure of calamity and grief inflicted by thee, for thou didst slay her father.—” “Fair Agnes!” said he, “thou art wrong. I did not. Another slew him in the scuffle!” “But thy treachery ensnared him to destruction. Poor Isabella! she is no more. She died awfully insane, the victim of thy ingratitude and thy crimes!” “I grieve for her death, for she loved me. But if I could not love her, am I to blame? For a time I tried to love her, and thought I had succeeded. But I saw you, and found I was mistaken. The soft regard—perhaps I should rather call it, the petty fondness—I felt for her, bore no comparison, in intensity, to the all-absorbing passion I feel for you. Had I never seen you, perhaps, I might not have been ungrateful to her. To your charms alone has my ingratitude been owing. Can you blame me for this?” “Thy love for me!” she exclaimed. “Oh, thou deceitful and barbarous man, I am truly unfortunate in being the object of thy love. Alas! if thou wouldst acquire any portion of my regard, talk not to me of love. I cannot hear thee without loathing.” “Fair Agnes,” he replied, “dost thou not know love to be an involuntary impulse? If I could have compelled myself to love Isabella, I might then have been justly charged with ingratitude. If I could now refrain from loving thee, thou mightest properly reproach me for cherishing a feeling thou wilt not, perhaps canst not, return—thou mightest rightly reprimand me for troubling thee with a subject which thou loathest. Oh! Agnes, if thou wert mine, thy virtues would chase away my vices. I would become what thou shouldst choose to make me. But without thee, I feel I can never be virtuous—I can never be happy.” “This is rhapsody—it is delusion,” she replied. “Thou dost not want strength of mind. Struggle to win the victory over thy bad passions. It will be the most glorious thou hast ever gained, and will afford thee more satisfaction than any triumph whether of successful war or prosperous ambition.” “Thou dost throw away thy counsel, my lovely adviser,” said he, looking fondly on her countenance, which animated by her subject, had brightened, during her observations, into a most beautiful glow. “By heaven, I would not resign my love for thee for an empire! It is the sweetest sensation that ever animated my frame. At this moment it sweeps through my veins with a thrill of delight, which I would not forfeit for the riches of the Indies.—Thou must be mine, I tell thee, ere long, or perdition shall seize us both!—Till to-morrow think of the fervour of my passion. I must leave thee till then.” He had heard the sound of a bugle which was the signal for a joint-muster of the Indians S and tories, in order to perform some military manœuvres previous to a carousal they were to hold in the afternoon, in celebrating their late decisive victories. On such celebrations, it was the practice of the Mohawks to sacrifice some prisoners to the manes of their slain warriors. But so complete had been the previous day's slaughter in the fort, that no prisoners had been made, except those who fell, as we have seen, into the hands of Butler. This barbarous part of their ceremonies, therefore, the Indians had no means of performing unless Butler should give up some of his prisoners for the purpose. Brandt made an application to this effect. But Butler's design of conciliating Agnes prevented him from complying. He reminded Brandt that the glory of obtaining so large a number of scalps as he now possessed, more than compensated for the want of prisoners; and that, as to the few he had himself taken, he considered he was well entitled to the entire disposal of them, especially as he had not interfered with the operations of Brandt in securing as many scalps as he had thought proper. He also observed that had the Mohawks been less eager to seize upon these trophies of victory, they would not have destroyed all their enemies upon the spot, and might now have been in possession of many prisoners. Brandt acquiesced in the propriety of these remarks, and the captives of Butler were permitted to remain solely at his own disposal. During the carousal, or, as the Indians termed it, the Feast of Victory, on this occasion, every species of riot and debauchery was indulged in to excess. To describe a scene of such frantic folly and disgusting dissipation, would be to give a representation of human depravity and degradation, neither agreeable to write nor desirable to read. While in a state of intoxication, an altercation, as was to have been expected, took place between some of the Indians and the tories, which the interference of their chiefs alone prevented from becoming serious and bloody. In consequence of this, it was agreed by Butler and Brandt, that, while the Indians remained in the Valley, they should encamp at a distance from the tories, but not so far off as to prevent the maintenance of friendly intercourse, or a speedy junction in case of either being attacked by an enemy. On visiting Agnes the next day, Butler approached her with the self-satisfied air of a wooer who thinks he can plead the merit of having performed an action of a nature very pleasing to his mistress. “My sweet Agnes,” said he, “you will not consider me destitute of all claim upon your esteem, when I inform you, that, but for my exertions your fellow captives would have been yesterday sacrificed by the savages in conformity with their ferocious customs. Do I merit no portion of gratitude for saving them?” “I do, indeed,” she replied, “and they too must feel grateful to you for this.—And oh! if you were to conduct us to a place of safety and restore us to liberty; abandon the wicked schemes in which you are engaged; repent of the crimes and the cruelties you have committed upon your own kindred and people; and by your future conduct make some atonement for them—then might you yet require respect upon earth and forgiveness from Heaven.” “Agnes,” said he, “I know that you think me a villain, but I did not suppose that you thought me a fool. Were I to do what you say, and throw myself upon the mercy of the whigs, in all the contrition of a sincere penitent, would not the halter be my fate? My father's death admonishes me not to trust my enemies. I have avenged him amply, and, therefore, my spirit rejoices in my career. But I have no desire to become the victim of that career, by trusting to the mercy of those to whose friends I have shown none. No; I can form no connexion with the rebels—I can make no peace with them. But for thy sake, fair charmer, I can, in future, be less virulent in my resentment—less destructive in my revenge. Nay, hear me further; if thou wilt comply with my wishes, if thou wilt be mine, I will set thy friends at liberty, I will withdraw from all scenes of strife—I will retire to Canada or Europe, and though I will not make peace with the rebels, I will no more lift my hand against them. Say, fair Agnes, wilt thou sign the treaty? “Sign a treaty to become thine!” she exclaimed, “no; never! My reason forbids it, my heart shrinks from it, and my vows render it impossible. Expect it not, I entreat thee; and if thou wouldst not make me utterly abhor thee, persecute me no more with thy applications.” “By Heaven,” he ejaculated, “I have been patient long enough with this girl's obstinacy.— Maiden, I shall not be so easily baffled in my wishes, as thou thinkest. Mine thou must be. I find that the mild means of persuasion will not prevail with thee. But thou art in my power— thy father—thy friends are in my power. I can bring force—terror—torture to my aid. I have but to say the word, and they are borne to the stake. By six this evening thou shalt consent to be mine or they shall—die!” She heard the dreadful threat pronounced S 2 with the tone, and accompanied by the looks of a demon, and she knew he had daringness and cruelty enough to perform it. Her terrified imagination overcame her fortitude. She caught him as he was hastily retiring, and, although she felt as if even the touch of his garment were pollution, she clung to his arm in an imploring attitude, and with a voice and look of sorrow that would have softened a fiend, “Oh! if thy heart be human,” she said, “have pity, pity on my wretchedness!” “Have pity on thyself,” he replied, “have pity on me—on thy father—on thy friends!— Reflect till six!” So saying he left the room, and under the impression that the persuasions of Miss Watson, whose life depended on her decision, might prevail on her to comply, he ordered that young lady into her apartment. He himself hastened to that of Mr. Norwood. “I come,” said he, “my reverend friend, on an errand of much consequence to yourself, to your daughter, and to all your fellow prisoners. You know the violence of my love for Agnes. You also know her obstinate antipathy to me. She is in my power. I might seize upon her charms by force. But my wishes are for an honourable union with her. No persuasions of mine can induce her to consent. Exert your authority. Should you succeed, you and your friends shall be set at liberty. I shall retire from the contest against the whigs, and reside in tranquillity either in Canada or England.” “When I was formerly your prisoner” replied Mr. Norwood, “you obtained my answer to a similar proposal. My answer now shall be the same that it was then; for my mind is unchanged on the subject. I will not comply with your wishes.” “Then hear thy doom, foolish, obstinate man,” said Butler, in a tone of fierce determination—“and the doom of thy captive friends —ye shall, should she not consent to save you, be delivered up by the dawn to-morrow, to the Mohawks, who, at noon, shall bind you to the stake, and sacrifice you upon the flaming faggots, according to the customs of their tribe!” “When thou shalt have done that, cruel man!” said Mr. Norwood, “thou shalt have done thy worst. I pray to the gracious Power who can disconcert all the designs of the wicked, and into whose hands I commit my fate and that of my friends, that, be our destiny and that of my daughter what they may, he will avert from her what I would deem the most direful of all misfortunes, a union with thee!” “Rash man,” replied Butler, foaming with rage, “it ill becomes thy prudence when under the paw of the lion, to goad him to wrath; and it is but a poor display of clerical sanctity to convey reproof in the words of insolence. I swear to thee, thou shalt soon be taught thy own pulpit doctrine of repentance. Either that doom, which seems to thee the most direful of misfortunes, shall overtake thee—thy daughter shall be mine—or thou shalt die!” He pronounced the last word with a terrible emphasis; and casting on Mr. Norwood the scowl of a fiend, he hurried furiously from the apartment. At the threatened hour of six, the enamoured tyrant waited on Agnes to ascertain her decision. He dismissed Miss Watson sternly, for he perceived from the mixture of detestation and defiance with which she regarded him on his entrance, that she had not been a very zealous advocate for either his interest or her own. “And now, my fair one,” said he, as he closed the door after Miss Watson's departure, “I want to know whether thou hast decided on peace or war, and art resolved that thy father and his friends shall live or die?” “Alas! to what straits does thy cruelty drive me!” said she. “If my own death will satisfy thy barbarous wishes, Oh! I intreat thee to inflict it, and spare my unoffending parent and thy other intended victims?” “Thy death!—Nonsense!” he exclaimed— “Thou dost trifle with me. I am serious. Thou knowest that it is thy love—or thy person, if I cannot have thy love—and not thy death that I desire. Thy death! No; I would be miserable if thou shouldst die before I possessed thee!— But now for thy decision? Wilt thou be mine, or shall the victims die?” “Hear me,” she said, assuming a sudden energy inspired by the utter hopelessness of her situation—“Unhappy and inhuman tyrant, thou mayest sacrifice those victims; but their death shall avail thee nothing. Thine I never will be. If they die, I shall die also. Their destruction and mine, shall only aggravate thy crimes in the sight of God and men. It will sink thy soul more deeply into perdition, and render thy memory more accurst.” “Ha! sorceress!” he cried, “dost thou too speak the language of defiance? Well may a sinner like me be pardoned some rudeness when holy men and gentle ladies can assume the tone of violence and the language of menace. But, fair one, I am made of materials too stern and unyielding to be frightened by the denunciations of a maiden's wrath, or even the curses of a priest. I am master of thy destiny, and of the fate of thy friends, and they shall be wielded to suit my purpose. Since thy resolution is taken, so is mine. I shall see you to-morrow at ten!” He withdrew; his countenance expressing the settled sternness of determined malignancy, rather than the violence of irresolute rage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. XVII. How shall I woo her? she is obstinate— As well attempt the firin-set rocks to move With the soft motion of the zephyrs wing, As try persuasion on her. But the bolts Launched by the red artillery of the sky Can to their entrails rend the solid rocks: And there's a thunder that can shake the mind, Formed by the raging agony of terror: With it I'll woo her till her heart be rent, And moulded into trembling pliancy. Harley. What a terrible night of hopeless sorrow did Agnes Norwood spend in her lonely chamber! She was in utter solitude, left a prey to her own despairing thoughts without a counsellor or a companion. Her tyrant had forbidden Miss Watson to be again admitted to her, for he truly conjectured that, disregarding all selfish considerations, she had strengthened, by her influence and arguments, the opposition of Agnes to his wishes. He had, therefore, ordered her to be elsewhere closely confined, and to prepare for death the next day. Miss Watson heard her sentence with the calmest resignation. She felt herself a martyr in a just cause, and she determined that her fortitude should not be overcome by any consequence, however terrific, that should arise from having done her duty. She had, indeed, been always of a resigned and enduring temper; and death had of late too frequently appeared to her and threatened her in his most hideous forms, for her to be now surprised if he should overtake her at last. She had witnessed the destruction of hundreds of beloved friends and respected neighbours. It was by a miracle that astonished herself, that she had hitherto survived. She could not always expect such a special interference of Providence. What greater claim had she upon life than those who had already fallen? She could not conceive of any. To the dispensation, therefore, now awarded her, she was resolved to submit as her duty dictated, without repining and without complaint. The character of Agnes was not so stoical. Her disposition was much more sensitive, yet she was equally firm in her adherence to duty. She had besides, causes of inquietude from which her friend was exempt. The worst that could happen to Miss Watson was death. She had not, like Agnes, the fate of others in her hands. No one could charge his suffering to her obstinacy. But Agnes!—dreadful consideration!— the life of even thy own father depends on thy will! And wilt thou not save him?—And thy three other friends—are they to die too, because thou wilt not yield to the solicitations of a man who would wed thee? Alas! it must be so. Thou canst not break vows already made. Thou art the betrothed of another, thy fidelity to whom no accumulation of earthly calamities can ever shake. To be unfaithful to him would be to be unfaithful to Heaven and thy own soul—to be a traitor to thy own heart. It cannot be. Love, triumphant love assists thee now in the terrible task that duty requires thee to perform. The trial is severe, but thou art firm. Thy sufferings are great, but thou wilt endure without yielding to crime—thy heart may break, but it will not be false. Towards the morning, as the sleepless sufferer lay meditating on the horrors of her destiny, the door, to which her eyes were directed, slowly opened, and a soldier cautiously entered. Perceiving her awake, he approached, put a letter into her hand, and whispered, “when you read this, destroy it, or it may destroy me. Your father has paid me for delivering it. This will be an awful day! I am sorry I can do no more for either you or him.” He departed without giving her time to reply. She opened the letter. There was sufficient day-light to enable her to read as follows. “My daughter, I tremble lest you should be frightened into submission to the tyrant. Remember your vows of betrothment. They are as sacred and binding as the vows of marriage T itself. Let no peril nor calamity shake your fidelity to them. Care nothing for me. Let not my fate have the weight of a feather in opposition to the obligation of your solemn oath. I am resigned, my daughter, to the death which awaits me. Why should I wish to live, since I have witnessed the destruction of my beloved friends and neighbours—the zealous hearers of the word of life which I experienced so much delight in delivering to them— the pious communicants of the cup of salvation which I felt it so glorious a privilege to distribute among them. They are gone; I have nothing to do but to follow. To separate from thee, my child, I confess, is a heavy affliction, but it is not so heavy as would be the knowledge, that thou wert degraded and criminal. Perseverance in virtue, on this awful occasion, is the earnest and last injunction—and that the Almighty may bless and protect thee for ever, is the anxious prayer—of thy father.” At ten o'clock, Butler, according to his threat, visited her. “A chance still remains for thy friends,” said he. “Although I have promised them to the Indians, and the exulting Brandt has all things prepared for their execution, thou canst yet save them. Say only that thou wilt be mine. I shall recall my promise to the Mohawks. I will relinquish their confederacy, and fulfil every item of the proposal I have made to thee.” “Thou dost tempt me in vain,” she replied. “I will not be criminal; I will not break the oath of my betrothment to Henry Austin, though all the wicked and cruel powers of men and fiends should conspire to accumulate horrors upon me for the refusal!” “Thou hast named my rival—my detested rival!” cried he. “From thee his name comes with a torturing—a malignant influence. It has sealed the doom of thy friends, and converted my wish to persuade, into a resolution to compel thee.” At this moment, the music of the “Dead March,” was heard. He knew its meaning. He led her to the window. A melancholy procession was approaching. She beheld it; her heart sunk—the light left her eyes—she became dizzy, and had she not hasted to a seat, she would have fallen upon the floor. She had seen the prisoners—those friends so dear to her heart, bound and seated in a cart— her father and Miss Watson on the one side, and Dr. Watson and Colonel Dennison on the other, moving towards the place of execution. “Thou seest that I have made no empty threats!” said the tyrant, exultingly. “I perceive thou dost pity the plight of those poor victims of thy obstinacy. Wilt thou save them? Shall I stop the death-going procession, and restore those beloved ones, free and in safety, to thy arms? Say only thou wilt be mine, and this shall be done.” “I cannot—O! God forgive me!” She exclaimed, “if I am wrongly obstinate—obstinate even to the destruction of my revered parent!” “Save thy father!” cried the tyrant. “I had resolved no more to entreat, but to command thee—to force thee to yield. But once more, for the sake of those victims, I resort to entreaty.” “I am firm. Heaven has strengthened me,” she said with a tone and air of determination, which aroused the wrath of the tyrant. He exclaimed, “be it so then, perverse girl! They shall die, whilst thou shalt profit nothing. Thou shalt even behold them sacrificed, that thou mayst witness the firmness of my resolves. Thy charms shall then be mine without more parley. Look upon that couch. Thou shalt be brought back from the scene of death, and there—there, while the cries of the sufferers are still ringing in thy ears, shall thy charms become mine. Thy consent I will ask not. I have strength sufficient to seize upon happiness.—I shall riot on thy loveliness, until my longing soul shall be satiated with beauty!” He ordered her sentinel to assist him in conducting her to a light wagon which was in waiting. He placed her on a chair in this vehicle, and seating himself beside her, they followed, at a slow space, the melancholy procession already noticed, to the place appointed for the dreadful sacrifice. They reached it in about half an hour. It was a large field adjoining a farm-house, the owners of which had been slaughtered at the capture of the fort. The house stood southward from the field, and between them was a small garden, overlooked by a balcony. With a sternness of purpose and a refinement of cruelty characteristic of his infernal mind, Butler conducted the trembling Agnes to this balcony, that she might, in pursuance of his threats, witness the horrible sacrifice, for the completion of which every thing was now ready. He seated himself beside her, and, with barbarous officiousness, pointed out the arrangements of the scene. The field rose in a gentle ascent towards the north, on which side and on the east, it was bounded by a wood of considerable thickness. A small rivulet which flowed into the stream of the Sharon, formed its border on the west. Upon or near the bank of this rivulet, the tories had taken their station, as spectators, leaving to the Indians, the office of being the performers T 2 in the dreadful drama. The latter were ranged near the centre of the field. Immediately in their front, between them and the house, were placed, in a line, four large piles of wood, about eight or ten yards asunder. To a stake erected in the centre of each of these piles, and projecting five or six feet above them, was bound one of the victims. The piles were intermixed with a quantity of dried leaves and straw, plentifully besprinkled with tar, in order to facilitate the kindling of the mass. A burning pile which had been kindled somewhat nearer the house, sent up to the air its mingling volumes of flames and smoke, which occasionally bent their red and dusky streams towards the prisoners, as if to familiarize them with their fierceness ere they should envelope them in their fatal folds. Round this burning pile stood four Indians, of peculiarly fierce aspects, who were appointed as executioners. They were kindling the brands with which they were to fire the combustible piles, upon which the prisoners were bound. This last act of preparation was, at length, completed, and these ferocious figures only awaited the signal which Brandt, who stood near the balcony, was to give, at the intimation of Butler, to perform their horrid office. A solemn silence pervaded the whole field Every eye was fixed, with intense interest, upon the innocent victims of barbarous customs and lawless and revengeful passions. A heavy horror hung over the scene which seemed to paralyze motion and to diffuse melancholy through all surrounding nature. At length the demon of the mournful drama arose, and with a smile of malignant triumph, looked first towards the prisoners, then upon the horror-struck fair-one beside him. She was pale as sackcloth, her lips quivered, her eyes were swollen, her heart was faint; but her soul looked towards Heaven, was fixed upon truth, and resolved on an adherence to duty. “Fair-one,” said the demon, “look on thy friends. The balance of their fate is suspended. Life and death are in the scales. One word from thee will make either preponderate. I ask, for the last time, wilt thou be mine?” She raised her eyes towards Heaven, and grasping with her whole soul at the unfailing support of conscious rectitude, she committed the issue of all to the protection of her Maker, and firmly answered—“No!” The tyrant turned from her with fury streaming from his eyes. He gave a signal to Brandt, who instantly raised the death shout; and the executioners, flourishing their flaming brands in the air, were hastening to fire the fatal piles, when a man, in the garb of a prophet, bearing the consecrated wand of Manetto, rushed impetuously from the woods, and commanded them to forbear. “Stand back!” said he, “Mohawks! In the name of the Great Spirit, I charge you to cast away your brands, and harm not the innocent at these stakes, on peril of the vengeance of the Almighty!” The prophetic symbol which he displayed, together with the boldness and energy of his manner, and the awfulness of his words, were successful. The executioners, and indeed all the Indians who beheld him, except the untameable Brandt, respected the words of the prophet, and feared the denunciation delivered so impressively in the name of the Great Spirit. Even Brandt felt tremulous at the first appearance of the prophet. But he soon recovered, for he recognised him to be the object of his late resentment, the Hermit of the Woods. His rage kindled, and when he perceived the executioners to throw down their brands and relinquish their office, he rushed forward to the Hermit. “How darest thou, dotard,” said he, “intrude thyself and thy madness between us and the sacrifice of our captives? The spirits of our slain warriors call upon us for the vengeance which we must inflict upon these victims. I have my own wrongs to avenge upon thee, Rodolph. Retire, and disturb us not in this feast of vengeance, or I will cut thee down where thou standest.” “I defy thee, vain man!” returned the Hermit, camly. “Thou darest not—I am here in defence of innocence, and in the service of the Great Spirit. In his name, I command thee to set these prisoners free. If thou refusest, his hand is out-stretched, and immediate destruction shall fall upon thee!” “Destruction shall fall upon thee first,” shouted the infuriate Mohawk, and he plunged his tomahawk into the breast of the prophet. All the spectators shuddered, but stood still as if horror had rooted them to the ground. “Brandt! Brandt!” said the Hermit, as he fell to the earth, “thou knowest not what thou hast done. This deed has filled the measure of thy wickedness. There is no more peace for thy spirit. Thou hast slain thy father!” Brandt uttered a yell of horror which made the air quiver and astonished the Indians who were now moving irregularly and timidly towards him. He caught his father's breast, and held it with an endeavour to stem the issuing of the blood that flowed from it.” “It is in vain,” said Rodolph. “But thank Heaven thou seemest penitent, and I forgive thee. —I deserved this. In my youth I was wicked as thou. My father's liberal bounty I exhausted in dissipation. At length he refused to supply me with more. I longed for his riches. I slew him. Oh God! then, then, frenzy seized my brain! I fled from civilization. Your mother nursed me in my delirium. I recovered—I married her. You were born.— I fled from your presence. He who has injured a father ought never to have a son. A presentiment I could not banish, told me that you were to be the avenger of my father's blood —I slew my father—my son has slain me! Eternal justice, thou art satisfied!” he said and died. Butler, on perceiving from his station on the balcony, this interruption to the execution of his victims, hastened forward to ascertain distinctly the cause. By the time he approached, the Hermit had ceased to speak. He saw Brandt powerfully affected. He was surprised, for he knew not the cause. “What! is this the hero of the Mohawks!” said he, upbraiding his confederate in iniquity. “I thought thou hadst the soul of a warrior; but thy heart is grown feeble like a woman's. The spirits of thy fathers will be ashamed of thy weakness.” Brandt cast upon him a look of indignation. “The spirits of my fathers ashamed of me!” he exclaimed. “Ay; they will curse me. But thou—thou hast nothing to do with my fathers. Hie hence, lest, if thou frettest me, in my madness I slay thee!” “What! art thou, indeed, mad?” cried Butler, in astonishment. “Does it grieve thee that thou hast slain a peevish grey-beard who was thy enemy?” “Ha!” cried Brandt, seizing his tomahawk, which was still reeking with the blood of his father, “if thou wilt scoff again, I have a weapon accustomed to pierce hearts. By the blood that is now upon it,I swear I am thy friend no longer!” “Nonsense!” returned Butler, perceiving the impolicy of irritating the savage farther. “I wish not to offend thee. I cannot comprehend the cause of thy agitation.—But enough of it. Let us now proceed with the sacrifice of the prisoners.” “Ah!” exclaimed the savage, his habitual taste for destruction returning. “Our customs require it.—He was but a white man,” he said to the executioners, who now stood near him, “and could not be a prophet of Manetto. Haste, fire the piles, and let the sacrifice be offered!” Being no longer in awe of Rodolph, whom they now considered a deceiver, and who lay dead before them, the executioners hastened to re-kindle their brands, which they soon accomplished, and waving them, as they blazed and crackled in the air, they proceeded towards the piles. But before they could apply the flaming instruments to their destructive purpose, a sudden shout of warlike voices issued from the woods, and a number of musket balls pierced each of them, together with the ferocious Brandt, and stretched them on the ground. This was instantaneously followed by a more abundant visitation of the same deadly missiles, upon the thickest groups of the Indians, more than a hundred of whom fell, and the rest fled in terror from the scene. Butler, with the whole force of the tories, was now advancing to check the flight of the Indians and give battle to the assailants, when Henry Austin, at the head of the Wyoming Volunteers, and about five hundred Continental troops, rushed out of the wood and charged the traitorous destroyers with the bayonet. They made but a short resistance. They were unable to withstand even the first shock of their disciplined adversaries. They broke, and imitating their Indian allies, fled into the depths of the forest, leaving two hundred of their party dead on the field. Butler, even in this extremity, resolved to make an effort to retain possession of Agnes. He hurried from the scene of battle, as soon as he saw that the day was lost, to the balcony where he had left her in charge of a sentinel. By this time, however, the prisoners were unbound, and Dr. Watson, whose anxious eye followed the career of Butler over the field, perceived this movement, the intention of which he at once conjectured, just as Henry Austin approached towards him. “Fly, Henry!” said he, “fly to yonder balcony, and save your Betrothed from the destroyer!” With the speed of an arrow Henry obeyed, and just as Butler had seized Agnes to carry her off, he with one spring mounted the balcony, and one powerful thrust of his sword, annihilated the opposition which the sentinel imprudently offered to his advance upon Butler. “Ah! infamous miscreant!” cried he to the latter, “thank Heaven, I have thee!” “I know that this is my death-scene,” said the courageous ruffian, “for thy soldiers surround me. But I shall die with the satisfaction of knowing that thou, my detested rival, shalt not survive to enjoy Agnes.” So saying he made a desperate pass at Henry, aiming, not to save himself, but to destroy his antagonist. That antagonist, however, was too expert a swords-man to be endangered by such U maniac rashness. He struck the coming weapon aside with such force that it almost flew from its owner's grasp, while his own sword, in its backward sweep, nearly dissevered Butler's head from his body. “By that Heaven-directed blow,” said Colonel Dennison, who at that moment entered the balcony, “thou hast avenged the desolation of a whole people.” “Thou hast also,” said Dr. Watson, who entered immediately after the Colonel, “avenged thy father and thy sister, and rescued thy Betrothed from unspeakable misery—from the hands of a villain!” “Oh Agnes!” exclaimed Henry, straining her to his palpitating breast—“my beloved, my faithful one, thou art yet my own. I am happy —Heaven hath preserved thee for me!” “I see thee again!” said she. “Oh Henry, thanks to the Eternal! this is indeed happiness!” The tears rushed to her eyes; she hid her burning blushes in his bosom, and sobbed aloud the grateful agitations of her heart. “Bless thee, my son!” said Mr. Norwood, who now, with Miss Watson, advanced towards the victor. “The hand of Heaven is manifest in this day's deliverance. May the Almighty Power that sent thee at the critical moment, when all seemed to be lost, still befriend thee and that maiden, thy own betrothed, who has been true to thee and to her vows, amidst the severest trials that could beset human nature.” But we haste to close our narrative; and must, therefore, decline entering into a detail of the congratulations and outpourings of gratitude of which Henry Austin was now the object. The party retired from the eventful balcony to the residence of Mr. Norwood, which was so lately the prison of its venerable master and his friends. Henry now informed them that it was owing to information received from Rodolph the Hermit, that he had been enabled to come to their rescue at so critical a juncture. After the capture of Fort Wintermoot, Rodolph anticipating what would happen elsewhere, hasted on horseback, towards the Lehigh, where he understood that a party of Continentals was advancing to Wyoming. Here, fortunately meeting them, he stimulated their speed by the intelligence he imparted, and conducted them, by the shortest route, to their destination. “Yesterday,” said Henry, “Joseph Jennings joined us with a small party of his bush-rangers. He informed us where the Indians were encamped, but he knew nothing about the intended sacrifice. Rodolph, who had often, in the character of a prophet, by working on their superstition, restrained the ferocity of the savages in their wars, conceiving that he might possibly do some good by visiting them now in that capacity, hastened on before us, to their encampment. We followed as fast as our numbers and equipments would permit. With the result of his arrival, as well as of ours, ye are acquainted. Would to Heaven we had arrived but one week sooner! What an amount of unparalleled misery and desolation would have been prevented!” “The ways of Providence are, indeed, mysterious,” observed Mr. Norwood. “Often do the wicked triumph, while the virtuous are subjected to the most terrible calamities. But God is just; hence there must be a time and a place where the inequalities of this world shall be corrected, and the value of virtue and the principles of eternal justice vindicated to the satisfaction of both angels and men.”</field>
