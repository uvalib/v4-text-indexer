      <field name="fulltext">Vol. I. 2 CLINTON BRADSHAW. CHAPTER I. Near the court house, in one of our principal cities, (the especial whereabout and name, for certain reasons, we must leave to the sagacity of our readers,) in an autumnal evening, about eight o'clock, or after, not many years since, a young gentleman might have been seen walking in rather a quick step, like one who felt himself in somewhat of a hurry. On reaching the door of what appeared to be a lawyer's office, he rapped quickly against it with a leaden-headed rattan, such as were then, and are now, much the fashion. “Come in,” said a voice, from the upper story of the building, from the window of which a light shone forth into the street. “Hold a light, Bradshaw,” said the visiter, as he entered the lower room, “or I may break my neck over some of these chairs.” “Come a-head, my dear fellow; be cat-like, see in the dark, or feel—you know the room; besides, fancy you are stealing to your lady-love, and, though you need not tread with a feathery step, yet, be a little cautious. Take care you don't run your proboscis against the stair door—it's open: if you do, there'll be blood upon thy face; that won't look well at the party. Mind, there's a nail I fasten the door with, that may interfere with your inexpressibles: I've none to lend you;—I'm as poor as Job's turkey.” “I am ditto to Mr. Burke, and that's a good reason why you should have held the light,” said the visiter, who, by this time, had ascended the stairs free of harm, and entered the room. He found Bradshaw busily engaged, with his coat off, in the act of polishing a pair of pumps. The room was filled with rough shelves, which were covered with books, most of them of the law, as could be distinguished by the covers; but, in a kind of recess, formed by the flue of the chimney, was a number of miscellaneous works, which appeared to have seen some service. There was a screen in the room; behind it was a bed; and in the centre of the chamber, near the fire-place, in which was a little fire burning, stood a table; on it were scattered papers and books, apparently in much confusion. “Why, Bradshaw, you are a pretty fellow! It's after eight o'clock, and here you are blacking your pumps, and not dressed yet. Bah! your hands are as black as a chimney sweep's: I'd have a fellow to attend to such things for me, if I had to go in debt for it.” “So would I, and so do I; but the Rev. Mr. Longshore, who does me this honour, has gone to an abolition meeting,—and the calls of patriotism, or rather philanthropy, are, with him, stronger, of course, than pecuniary considerations. See, I'm giving them a polish like his face.” “Bradshaw,” said his companion, (whose name was Henry Selman, and who carefully dusted a chair ere he seated himself,) “what do you think of these abolitionists?” “Think of them! Why, that some of them are knaves, some of them are fools, and some of them are honest, but misguided, men. But, tell me, who's to be at the party?” “Why, all the world and his wife; I'm told the old fellow is going to do the handsome thing. He's made great preparations, and the womankind have been talking of it this week past. I wonder if the old chap is as rich as it is said?” “Doubtful.” “What makes you think so?” “Various circumstances; however, it is generally thought that, if he lives, he will be very wealthy. He, you know, is alike fond of money and display. He wants to win caste among the aristocratic, and he seeks to hide his original obscurity in display:— he cannot throw off the “filthy dowlas” of the plebeian, but he can cover it with patrician robes. It sometimes, as you know, steals out, though most wofully. I should rather say this of the family than of the old man, for he is indifferent to the aristocracy with which they would inoculate him. But why do you ask? are you speculating upon the solid charms of his daughters?” “Why, that depends, as you would say, upon the speculations of the father; they are fine girls, but they're as plenty as blackberries.” “Ay, and the parent stem is thorny: you must take care in the plucking, else you will find the thorns remain, after the sweets are not only plucked, but gone—all but the memory. There is no fun in wooing for gold, and marrying a portionless bride; besides, the old man's a hard knot, and if he had wealth, you would “feel hope deferred” for many a year, and of that heart sickness an unloved wife could not cure you. Again: though his fortune might give one daughter a splendid dower, think of it, when divided among the race of Perrys that are, and are to be.” “Bradshaw, you're a strange fellow: I never saw such a mixture of sensuality and sentiment, worldliness and romance, in any man, before.” “Well, sir, that's bad news: it's the very temperament to bedevil a man; for between the conflicting feelings which must be engendered in such a character, there must always be an irresoluteness of purpose—an action and reaction—that will make any thing but a successful, or a happy being.” Bradshaw's brow clouded as he spoke. He had finished the task which Mr. Longshore, but for the abolition meeting, would have performed for him, and with his toilet made, for he was quick and careless in making it, he stood leaning, with his arms folded, against the mantel-piece, looking abstractedly 2* into the fire. Selman paused, for a moment, from the self-complacent act of striking his square-toed shoe with his rattan, struck with the interesting and intellectual appearance of Bradshaw: He was rather below the middle size, and of slender and graceful proportions; his head was finely shaped; the hair thick and wavy, and worn carelessly, without any regard to the fashion, though it had been cut fashionably; the forehead was rather broad and perpendicular, than high; and his eye was dark and deeply set, with a quick and searching glance. It was capable of every variety of expression, and no one could look upon it, for a moment, without being struck by its expression. His nose was straight and finely formed, and the mouth chiselled, with compressed lips, for one so young, but which relaxed into a winning or scornful smile in an instant. There was, in him, that undefinable interest which some men create in the bosoms even of their most familiar acquaintances, and which strikes the most casual observer, and makes him anxious to know more of the character before him. He will occupy a considerable portion of this narrative. At the period where we now begin his history, he is about nineteen years of age, and a student of law. His previous biography is soon told: He is the only son of a most respectable farmer, whose progenitors landed on the pilgrim rock, among that little band who were the fathers of New England. In the progress of years, the immediate ancestors of Clinton Bradshaw emigrated to one of our middle states, and there his father tilled the farm which had been, for more than a century and a half, in his family. Clinton Bradshaw had, in early life, very bad health; so much so as to prevent him, for many years, from going to school. His mother, however, did all she could to compensate him for the loss: she kept him as close at his books, as his health and truant disposition would allow: nevertheless, he grew up, to the age of fifteen, without schooling in any respect. His health was often an excuse for him not only to quit the tasks of the master, but to throw aside those of the mother, and roam at large through the woods and by the streams where his wayward inclination led him. Yet, in consequence of severe attacks of indisposition, he was, at periods, much confined to the house; and by his mother's side he would read, day after day, and week after week, every variety of books, which, at his age, could interest a youthful mind; and some, which older minds delight in. Notwithstanding the religious character of his parents—they were Methodists—he was allowed to read just what he chose, and what the large circulating library of the city supplied; as any thing that would relieve his suffering, or make him forgetful of his tedious confinement, that which a spirited boy so illy bears, was permitted him. Romances, history, biography, novels, poems, were thus open to him, and through them he roamed, with as little restraint as through his father's fields, when his health permitted him to do so. His parents, too, though very plain people, at the period to which we allude, visited a great deal among their neighbours and in the city; and to divert the mind of their son—the only son —as well as to keep him immediately under the parental eye, for they felt momently and intensely anxious about his health, they always took him with them. In his early years a little stool was placed in the bottom of the gig for him, as regularly as the horse was harnessed; and when he grew older, Clinton's saddle was put upon his pony, and he accompanied his father to the different county meetings, religious and political; for the father felt an interest in both; and, though a modest and retiring man, was a leading character among his neighbours. At the quiltings and apple-butter frolics, Clinton was a favourite with every body—the farmers, their wives and daughters, always welcomed him. At the husking matches, where the negroes collect in the slave states with the labouring class of whites, on some allotted evening, and make a frolic of stripping the corn, which has previously been thrown in a pile, from the husks, no one's coming gave more real satisfaction to all. The old negroes would observe, “There comes Massa Clinton; he good to poor nigger; he make good massa:” and the youngsters would grin from ear to ear, with the anticipation of some harmless trick that Clinton would be sure to play off upon some one. The whites, too, would greet him, one and all; his presence, young as he was, never failed to give delight to every one. In this way Clinton Bradshaw's character became a marked one in early life. In the company of his father and mother, he went frequently into the best society the neighbourhood afforded, (in it were some of the oldest and most respectable families in the country,) and under circumstances where he seldom met boys of his age; this compelled him to seek what enjoyment he found on such occasions, in the conversations of his elders, male and female. He would stand by his father's side and listen, for hours, to matters of grave discussion between him and his friends, or talk with the old ladies of his mother and themselves: with the young ones he was most popular; he early learned the thousand nameless arts of pleasing them, which he practised not with the sheepishness of a boy, but just with boyishness enough to make them remark what a man he would be. From these various scenes, when his mother did not accompany him, he would return and tell her all about them. As his father was not communicative concerning his meetings with his friends, through Clinton, Mrs. Bradshaw generally learned what his father said and what others said. To his mother, and his little sister,—he had but one sister,—he would narrate all he saw in the female community of the neighbourhood: and whenever he had been from home they were sure to ask him all about his visit, which he could recount with a discrimination of character and powers of conversation far above his years. All these various circumstances made him manly, early, and gave him address, self-possession and self-reliance in every company. His reading, in his long hours of sickness, had been such as to fit him to shine in society. At fifteen, Clinton's health rapidly improved; so much so that, at his own request, he was taken from the county school and boarded in the city, that he might attend the high school, or college, if we give the epithet to the institution with which the trustees were wont to dignify it. In town his mind rapidly developed itself; in the routine of school his companions surpassed him, but in composition and declamation he stood unrivalled. He was popular, both with his tutors and his school-mates; for though hasty, and prone to resentment, he was frank, magnanimous, and daring. He had, however, the temperament which is said to belong to genius. He was subject to an inequality of spirits, and to a depression, which sometimes made him moody in the gayest scenes. This was observed of him in his early boyhood; he would retire from his companions, in the midst of their gaiety, and sit apart, musing, for hours. He was, perhaps, rather suspicious: this, in after life, he attributed to reading tales of treachery and blood, such as first caught his attention in boyhood. Without the occurrence of any material incident, other than may be noticed in the progress of our narrative, Clinton Bradshaw left school with a high reputation for talent—the very highest—and commenced the study of the law. In the office, in the upper story of which our readers have been introduced to him, he had been a student nearly a year.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. Mr. James Perry, at whose house the party was given, was one of that class of individuals who are frequently to be met with in our country. From extreme poverty and obscurity he had risen to opulence, and that kind of reputation which opulence bestows. On 'Change, he was bowed to with profound respect by his brother merchants; the lawyer knew him as one able to fee well; the mechanic, as one who paid well; the young, fashionable men, about town, as the old chap who had daughters and something to give them; and the young ladies, that is, certain of them, as the delightful old gentleman with such fine sons; and the solicitors of all sorts of nameless charities, as the very one whom they had best get to head the lists of contributions: therefore, Mr. Perry was a distinguished citizen. He was a shrewd, money-making, money-keeping old man, with a good deal of worldly wisdom. He did not look upon the bright side of human nature, but he was good-natured, and he retained much of his original vulgarity, which did not trouble himself, but afflicted his family sorely. Mr. Perry had four daughters and two sons; the oldest of the daughters was married to Mr. Joseph Nutt, who formed one of the firm of Perry, Nutt, &amp; Co.; the Co. being represented by the eldest son of Mr. Perry; namely, Mr. James Perry, jr. The rest of the family were unmarried, but marriageable. There was, first, Miss Priscilla Perry, and then Miss Penelope Perry, and then Miss Jane Perry, and then, last, though not least, at least in his own estimation, was Mr. Washington Perry. The mother of this race was a thin, bustling, active old lady, who loved her children devotedly, and always sided with them when any discussion took place between them and their father on certain fashionable proprieties, which the old gentleman seemed to have a propensity to violate, or rather not to understand. Upon this point Mrs. Perry felt herself entitled to admonish him, as she was sometimes wont to observe, in the family circle, that she came of a family who knew what high life was when Mr. Perry first got acquainted with her: and he had to show the devotion of years, in which time his property did not decrease, before the lady could be brought to consent to accept his long proffered hand. Two suits of rooms were thrown open to receive the company who assembled on this evening. It was, literally, a squeeze. An individual moved about to the eminent risk of his neighbours' toes and to, apparently, the unutterable damage of the ladies' dresses. It required the skill of an accomplished tactician to step amidst the mass of fashionables (dare we use the expression) and not do injury. How frowningly disdainful would curl some fair one's lips, when some one whom she held of little worth disordered her robes in passing!—particularly if the individual chanced to be one of her own sex, the why and wherefore of whose invitation she held debateable. These squeezes are a great test of amiability. How many passions are attempted to be thrown off with the old dress! and how many soft phrases and kind looks are put on with the new one! which, like it, often lose their gloss before the evening is over;—and yet here were many happy faces that were really emblems of happy hearts—and many more, that wore the seeming, and had it not—this counterfeiting, though, proves one thing—that the true coin is not only current, but valuable. The party was a brilliant one—all the fashion of the town were there, and they had assembled before Bradshaw and his friend arrived. “I declare, Mr. Selman,” said Miss Penelope Perry, a plump, pretty, good-natured coquettish girl, “I declare you are really getting too fashionable; you are the last of all!” “Not in your good opinion, I hope, Miss Penelope,” said Selman, with a most gallant air, which was meant to be tender. “You deserve to be, if you are not, sir, for coming at such a time.” “I assure you, Miss Penelope,” said Bradshaw, “it was my fault. I detained Selman; and the Vol. I. 3 only way I could keep him was, by discoursing of yourself.” As this was said, Selman took his seat by Miss Penelope, and Bradshaw, cutting his eye at him, whispered, “Three is bad company,” and sauntered to another part of the room. “My, what fine manners Mr. Bradshaw has,” said Miss Penelope; “he's so good-looking, and they say he is superior to all the young men in the city. Is it so?” The way that “superior to all the young men in the city” was pronounced, gave Selman, for a moment, a queer sensation, that was not pleasurable, but he rallied and said, “He's the finest fellow I know; as that wild Kentuckian, Willoughby, says, he's a whole-souled fellow.” “I wonder he don't go more into society, I never saw easier manners.” “Yes, he has very fine manners; but, Miss Penelope,” said Selman, lowering his voice, “why did you treat me so coldly at your sister's, Mrs. Nutts, last night? You had neither smile nor look for any one but that booby Bates.” “Kentuck,” said Bradshaw to Willoughby, in another part of the room, “how do you like our city? and how does this gay scene before you compare with old Kentuck?” “Why, sir,” said Willoughby, who was proud of being a Kentuckian, “Kentuck would not suffer in the comparison. There we have more frankness; and in getting up a ball or party extempore we could beat you. I wish, Bradshaw, you would take a trip across the mountains with me, some of these days, and judge for yourself; you would be delighted with the Kentuckians, and, to tell the truth, you remind me a good deal of them.” “Thank you, sir. Estimating your countrymen as I know you do, I feel, indeed, that you have paid me a compliment.” “Ah, Mr. Willoughby, I'm glad to see you, sir,” said old Mr. Perry, advancing towards the young men, and giving them a hearty shake of the hand; “you must make a good report of us, when you write home. Mr. Bradshaw, you are welcome, sir. I believe you are not yet acquainted with my wife, sir,—my lady—Mrs. Perry?” “I have not yet had that pleasure, sir; though I have several times called upon the Miss Perrys, I have not been so fortunate as to see your lady.” The old gentleman took the arm of Bradshaw and led him up to Mrs. Perry, who was standing by the mantel-piece, with great dignity, waiting the approach of her guests. Bradshaw was, accordingly, introduced. “I believe, Mr. Perry built this house himself, ma'am,” said Clinton, looking round the ample dimensions of the room, and at the costly furniture, “did he not?” “Yes, sir—oh, yes, sir; and, I believe, I may lay claim to some of it as being according to my taste.” “All of it, I should presume, ma'am.” “Yes, sir, and the Miss Perrys, the folding-doors, sir—they are broader, you perceive, than they are generally made. I took the hint from Mrs. Holliday's, and she, I'm told, saw all the houses after this fashion when she was in Europe.” “Mrs. Holliday; is she here, ma'am?” “Yes, sir: that tall lady in black, whom you see standing by the piano. She is a delightful lady; I love her very much.” “I have the pleasure of knowing her.” “Yes, Mr. Clinton Bradshaw, it seems you know every body this evening, except me, your old school-mate,” said a sweet voice at Bradshaw's elbow. Bradshaw turned quickly, and well he might. The speaker was a female, and could scarcely be sixteen. Her form was of the finest proportions, and graceful as could be; perhaps, she was not quite tall enough. The rose was just budding. The delicately moulded hand, which he felt tremble a little, as he clasped it, was proverbially beautiful and fair. The neck, thrown archly back, may be, with a little consciousness, was nearly hid by long and clustering curls of light auburn hair, that seemed, as the light was reflected on them from a large mirror opposite, to have been gathered of sunbeams, among which night had partly thrown her shadows, if I may dare to use such an expression, and bound upon her brow with starry looking pearl. Her forehead was very fair, but rather broad than high, and the eyebrow rather deeply drawn, and slightly arching. Her eye was blue— blue as heaven, with a softness over it, like a summer's sky seen between whitest clouds; but its expression changed with every feeling, while a playful archness and sensibility lurked in her exquisite and redolent lip. “Mary,” he exclaimed, warmly,—“I beg pardon, Miss Carlton, when did you come to town?” “Yes, sir, you're a pretty schoolmate to neglect your old friends at this rate! I brought a note for you from your sister, and I was determined you should not have it till you called for it. I came to town the day before yesterday, and this is the first you knew of it, is it? And here you have been in the room this half hour, and, I verily believe, you have spoken to every one in it, old and young, except myself!” “No, Mary, no,” said Bradshaw, in a low voice— “ `Every humbler altar passed, I now have reached the shrine at last.' Indeed, I am glad to see you. If I had known you were here, I should not have loitered away so long: I should have had the pleasure of waiting on you here. How is my sister? But I heard from her to-day.” “Is she well?” “Yes.” “She has written you a very long letter. She said you were to be out there next Sunday. She charged me to tell you to take care of your health.” “My kind parents and sister think I am still an invalid, and they regard me still as the poor, frail child who gave them so much uneasiness. I consider myself now in strong health, and, as I never was much of a student, and read less now than I 3* did two years since, there is a likelihood of my health remaining strong.” “I hope so; but, Mr. Clinton, what if you should become dissipated among your city friends? I suppose you flatter yourself, that you have strength of mind sufficient to resist all temptation.” “Quite the contrary: I find that the prayer, `Lead us not into temptation,' which I have so often heard my father repeat, must be mine in spirit and in truth; for, Mary, to tell you the truth, I fear, whenever I get into temptation, temptation gets the better of me. Won't you be my guardian angel?” “Why, sir, according to your confession, you'll want a whole host of guardian angels; as many as were appointed in Pope's poem to guard the lady's hair,—and, after all, you know, the lock was stolen.” “Ah, but, Mary, who would not struggle with a thousand invisible shapes of air, and defy their influence, to win such a lock?” said Bradshaw, gazing upon her own luxuriant tresses. “Come, Mr. Clinton, none of your flattery here, sir,” said she, slightly blushing; “talk to me as you used to talk to me at school, when you walked home between Emily and me, and bore our baskets for us, and gathered the wild berries, and plucked the wild rose, and kept away the wild bull: do you remember that time?” continued she, drawing involuntarily closer to his side; “I shall never forget it, Clinton. Now, sometimes, it occurs to me you are altering, particularly since you have come to town: you seem more worldly, and more cold, and more ambitious, and what you say is said in choicer language, and with more self-possession, but is there so much of the heart in it?” “More of it, to you, Mary; but come, take my arm and promenade with me, and let me make some of these exquisites around us envious.” “Pray, who is that?” said a young man, in another part of the room, by the name of Bates, to his companion; “who is that, on whose arm Miss Carlton is leaning?” The interrogator is the same individual whom Selman, in reproaching Miss Penelope Perry for neglecting him, called “booby Bates.” He is a young gentleman who has high notions of himself,— high aristocratic notions of family,—notwithstanding his father was a pedlar, and peddled, with a pack upon his back, tapes and needles to the mothers of those around him, whom he affects to call plebeians. Mr. Bates was fresh from college, and strongly reminded one of Swift's lines— “Near a bow-shot from the college, Half the world from sense or knowledge.” His companion was a young gentleman of his own age and calibre. He replied to the interrogation in an affected tone of voice, saying, “'Pon honour, I don't know any thing about him. His father, I believe, is an old farmer—ploughman—who sells his own turnips in the market, and has, I suspect, hard times to raise the wind to support my gentleman in the study of the law. Really, Mr. Bates, the professions are becoming quite common!” “Yes, sir, very much so, Mr. Turnbull—but how came Miss Carlton to be acquainted with him?” “Why, I believe, sir, the fact is, that this young man's father's farm joins the estate of Mr. Carlton, and, I suppose, the young man, in running of errands to Mr. Carlton's, perhaps, to the overseer's, to borrow some article of husbandry for his father, chanced to get acquainted with Miss Carlton.” “She seems to treat him very kindly.” “He fastened himself upon her, probably, and she can't get rid of him. Besides, there's no accounting for tastes, you know; ha, ha, his father's a shouting methodist!” “We must reform these things, Mr. Turnbull, we must reform these things,” replied Mr. Bates, adjusting his stock. “Now, I'd give a hundred dollars,” thought Selman, who overheard this conversation, “if I had it to give, poor devil as I am, if Bradshaw heard this.—I hate that Bates, and I've just a great mind to tell Bradshaw. The blood of the pilgrims would be up in his veins, as Kentuck would say, like all wrath.” Selman was a great lover and utterer of quaint sayings. The dancing now commenced. Mr. Bates, with an air of extreme affectation, treading on his toes, and bending forward, advanced to Miss Carlton, and begged the honour of her hand for the dance. “Thank you, sir,” replied Miss Carlton; “I promised to promenade this set with Clinton—with Mr. Bradshaw. Are you acquainted with Mr. Bates, Mr. Bradshaw? Gentlemen, permit me to make you acquainted.” The young men bowed to each other: Bradshaw with easy civility, and Bates with much awkwardness, which was intended for dignity. “How long have you been home, Mr. Bates?” asked Bradshaw. “About a month, sir.” “I have not had the pleasure of meeting you before, sir. When Professor D—, of Yale, was in our city, some three months since, I had the honour of making his acquaintance. I received a letter from him to-day: he spoke of you, sir, and of several of your fellow students; and desired me to present his compliments to those of the graduates with whom I might be acquainted.” “Was he well, sir.” “Yes, sir, I thank you, very well,” replied Bradshaw, as he bowed and passed onward, with Miss Carlton leaning on his arm. The dance went on merrily. Selman was making the agreeable, with all his might, to Miss Penelope Perry; and the lady appeared to be particularly kind. Mrs. Perry was seated on the sofa, talking with one of the elder ladies, but evidently abstracted: judging from the expression of her eye, and its direction, she was observing the Miss Perrys. The way in which she contrived to keep all of them in the maternal vision, was an art which none but mothers, fond of their daughters, and anxious for them, can practise. There is a beauty and joy in the glittering dance which makes even age blithesome! The merry music—the many twinkling feet keeping time with it—the profusion of lights— the happy faces looking on—and the thousand little flirtations which the very courtesies of the dance call up in the feelings of partners, however indifferent to each other,—how strong, at the moment, the feelings of others, differently situated!—combine to make the scene one of enjoyment to all. Even the old gentlemen, who had been busily discussing the politics of the day over Mr. Perry's wine, quit the one, and forgot the other, while they joined the circle round the dancers, and called up the day of “Auld lang Syne.” To an observer of human nature, it is a pleasant sight, to behold, on such occasions, how the gray heads and caps of the company will become suddenly brisk and youthful in their civilities to each other. Then it is, the young discover that the manners of their fathers, which struck them as cold formalities—the formalities of another age, which must have been one of stiff ceremonies—are, in fact, as social as their own, when the social feelings are aroused. Their parents differ from them only as age differs from youth; as the snow-clad landscape, the frozen current, and songless bird upon the withered bough of winter, differ from the smiling landscape, the babbling brook, and tuneful bird, of summer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. It was late when the company broke up. Bradshaw stood in the passage with his hat under his arm, waiting to escort Miss Carlton home, who was up stairs, arraying herself in her cloak and bonnet. As she descended, Mr. Bates stepped up and offered her his services. “I am sorry to deprive you of so much pleasure, sir,” said Bradshaw; “but this is an honour and a gratification which I cannot resign.” As Bradshaw passed out, with Miss Carlton leaning on his arm, Willoughby and Selman both addressed him with—“Bradshaw, meet us at Fleming's.” “Mary, this is a beautiful night! how bright the moon and stars are! I should love these autumn evenings, were it not that the leaves of these shade trees seem, when moved by the night air, to be sighing for summer. The happiest period of my life was the six months after I had left my town school, previously to my commencing law student, which I spent in the country. How often have I walked with yourself and Emily on such an evening! The stilness of the scene, interrupted only by the falling of the leaves, and the breath of the wind among them, contrasts with this so strangely and so jarringly, that I wish we were walking there now, that “Auld lang Syne” might be called up without any discordant associations.” “I wish so too, with all my heart, for it seems to me that, in town, one feels more worldly, and disposed to speculate upon and question feelings which, in the country, we should be content with enjoying.” “Yes, 'tis just so; and who ever yet quit a crowded and bustling scene, such as we have just left, and went forth, in the still night, without feeling a certain sense of loneliness—no, I cannot, must not say loneliness, with you by my side—but a conviction that their happiness never can spring from such scenes, and that they constitute but a small portion of it.” “True, Clinton,” said his companion, looking up into his face; “but why do you, who seem to enjoy such scenes so much, philosophize so much against them?” “Ay, there's the rub: I do enjoy myself a great deal, but it is the enjoyment of mere excitement, which must give place to gloomy thoughts. I do believe that we start in life with a certain portion of animal spirits, which, like a bottle of Champaign, we cannot use and keep; or, to use a homelier illustration, we cannot eat our cake and have it too.” “But is not the memory of its enjoyment a pleasure?” “Why, I don't know; I rather think with Byron— “Joy's recollections are no longer joy, But sorrow's memory is sorrow still”— Here am I now, with the world before me, to force my way in a toilsome and most laborious profession, with thousands running the same career; even should I win in the race, it may be at the expense of health, and to find the goal beside the grave, and scarcely a breathing time, before the breath is gone for ever.” “What put you in such a strange humour, Clinton?” “Oh, I don't know,—seeing you, I suppose, whom I have not seen for so long. It throws me back upon all my early feelings, which, to tell the truth, I have not called up lately. They come upon me like an overflowing stream that has been pent up for a long time. My `little bark of hope' may be said to be upon the breakers, driving I know not whither—he who holds the helm, you know, must not look back too often to the land he's left—must not look back, I fear, at all—else, he may be wrecked upon his venturous voyage. He must go on, like Columbus, and quell the passions that rise, like his mutinous mariners, to force him back. Therefore it is, Mary, that I want a guardian angel, as I told you early this evening, or, rather, a bright particular star, to control my destiny and make it happy.” “Ah! but Clinton,” said his companion, in a tone that a close observer would have discovered trembled Vol. I. 4 a little, “as I replied, you would want a host of guardian angels—a milky way of stars.” “This milky way of stars would but mislead me. Mary, I should verify, to quote poetry again, for the `stars are the poetry of heaven,' I should verify the lines of the poet— `A wand'ring bark upon whose path-way shone All stars of heaven, except the guiding one.' Well, here we are at your home. Let me pull the bell. I have talked and felt more romantic for this last half hour than I have since I last saw you.” “Clinton, you must call and see me very soon.” “Certainly—I will call to-morrow. Good night.” “Good night.” Bradshaw turned to leave; when he had proceeded ten or twelve steps from the door, he heard it shut gently. Buttoning his coat close up to the collar, he hastened down street, with a rapid step, to Fleming's. He descended the steps of the cellar, (it was an oyster cellar,) and in a few moments stood among his companions, who were all seated round the open stove of the establishment, waiting for him. “Bradshaw, you must have escorted Miss Carlton home at a snail's pace—Selman's just got here from Mr. Perry's; he lingered round Miss Penelope like old Mohegan about his birth-place,” exclaimed Willoughby. “Ah, did he?” replied Bradshaw; “I thought several times, when I observed Miss Penelope and Selman this evening, that she must have been influenced by a consideration of the text, `Blessed are the merciful;' and you know, Selman, that love is like mercy, it is thrice blessed; `It blesses her that gives and him that takes.' But beware of old Mohegan's fate, Hal; remember he expired in a flame, or, what is worse, he was literally scorched to death.” “Bradshaw!” exclaimed Selman, “plague take your quotations; be original. I heard you this evening, with your d—d die away air, repeating Tom Moore to Miss Penelope. I don't think Tom Moore should be repeated to any lady.” “Ah, Selman, Selman,” said Bradshaw, laughing, `The course of true love never did run smooth.' And I fear me that true love has run this evening as it always runs.” “I thought,” said Kentuck, “when I observed Selman this evening, that he was going ahead like one of our glorious Ohio steamers; but, by Jove, I believe he's run against a snag since. Stranger,” he continued, imitating the rough voice of a boatman, “you seem to be in a bad fix.” Here they all laughed heartily, save Selman, who tried to laugh, too, but his voice jarred like a cracked fiddle at a concert. “A fellow never knows when he is well off,” said Bradshaw. “I heard mother-in-law puff him up to the seventh heaven to-night, and the old gentleman echoed it.” “Come,” exclaimed Selman, jumping up and rallying; “love must be fed, gentlemen, and Bradshaw, I suspect you have an appetite,—you have been out so long in this cold night-air, hey? What say you?” “Yes, you're right, Selman; I have an excellent appetite. What say you to whisky-punch and oysters? Or, if you feel more ethereal, wine and oysters, or a beef-steak? for I must feed.” “I go in for the punch,” said Kentuck. The viands were accordingly ordered. “Gentlemen,” asked a modest, amiable young man, named Emory, “how did you enjoy yourselves this evening?” “As for me,” said Willoughby, “first rate. I stood by the sideboard and listened to father Perry with profound attention. The way I sucked in his wine and his wisdom was a caution. I drank bumpers to all his sentiments. Bradshaw, you, I thought, were, like Selman, drinking in something else.” “Yes,” said Selman, “I suspect, Willoughby, you're verifying the old proverb, `In wine there is truth.' I'll swear you're telling it on Bradshaw. What say you, Bradshaw?” Bradshaw smiled and replied,—“No man is obliged to criminate himself, as the law tells us. Criminate himself! Why, it would be criminal not to admire Miss Carlton!” “That's a fact,” said Kentuck; “she's the loveliest creature I ever saw, east or west.” “She has so much ease and grace,” said Emory; “and then, for one so young, she has such sweet manners to all.” The servant soon came in to say that their oysters were ready. “It's half after one, by Shrewsbury clock,” said Kentuck. “We are here all alone; come one and all into number seven. Mr. Fleming, please to let us have a goodly number of whisky-punches. Let me see; one, two, three, four, five—that's it; `there's a divinity in odd numbers.' No, we're not exactly alone neither; I see there's a light away off in that box.” The young men all entered box number seven, and before they left it, their stock of oysters had been replenished once or twice, and their glasses repeatedly; so often as to add a great deal to their already overflowing hilarity. The company were five in number; namely, Bradshaw, Kentuck, Selman, Emory, and another, whom we have not yet introduced to our readers, named Cavendish, who did not join his party until they had commenced their supper. Cavendish was a student of law, and from his great gravity, and a certain oddness, more, perchance, than for his legal acquirements, although they were very superior, his companions had already anticipated his elevation to the bench, by calling him judge. The judge's gravity had been considerably relaxed, and his tongue loosened, by the good things which the little green curtain of number seven hid from the vulgar eye. As the young men came forth and took their seats round the stove, Bradshaw and Cavendish were in warm dispute concerning the merits of different members of the bar. “I tell you what it is, Judge,” said Bradshaw, 4* “you may depend upon it, that Glassman, in point of real talent—of genius—is the first man at this bar. I know that he is dissipated—that he has been guilty of excesses—that there are many things in his life which the world condemns: but remember what Byron has so beautifully said of Sheridan— “What to them seemed vice might be but wo!” “Wo! exclaimed Cavendish, “you don't pretend to tell me there is any wo about Glassman!” “Yes, I do pretend to tell you that there is wo about Glassman—unhappiness, I mean.” “Unhappiness! What a man you are, Bradshaw; you're always fancying something of somebody. Why, he is one of the liveliest men I ever saw: it's a mere fondness for dissipation and profligacy which makes him lead such a life, and I consider that W— and T— are infinitely his superiors, as lawyers. What, in the name of common sense, makes you think that he's unhappy?” “If you please, a mere fancy. I know little of his history, and I don't know him personally; but he's a man who always interested me. He's dissipated, fond of society, yet, I'm told, has no intimates —he's a roué without a mistress—a gambler, indifferent to losses or gains—and you must have observed, if you've ever observed him, though not at all avaricious, he always attends closely to business, when he has a press of it; and it is in some interval of business, or when he has very little to attend to, that he commences his scenes of dissipation: I, therefore, conclude, that he does not seek dissipation for the mere love of it, but for the oblivion which it brings. Depend upon it, no man, no matter how loudly he laughs, or how easily he talks, ever exhibited such a character as Glassman, who was not unhappy; and, much as I may startle you with the thought, I do not believe his unhappiness springs from disappointed ambition or treacherous friendship—what think you of my saying of Glassman the roué, that I think the unhappiness, which I attribute to him, arises from a woman.” “You'll be an excellent advocate before a jury, Bradshaw, in fancying facts,” said Cavendish. “I might know a man all my life, and never elaborate such a character of him as you've just given; and here you, who don't know Glassman personally— know, you confess, nothing of his history—you pretend to draw such conclusions!” “Well, Judge,” replied Bradshaw, “I confess my premises are slender, and I lay claim to no superior penetration, but I have often observed Glassman at the bar, in the street, and at different places, and I really think what I said is correct, though, perhaps, I could get no one to sanction my opinion; but the superiority of his talents I can maintain on more tenable grounds: he is the first man at the bar, in point of natural capacity; in legal acquirements, he is not surpassed by either W— or T—; and in polite literature he is better versed than either of them. And, pray, who so eloquent? Who has a finer person? Who a better address? He joins conciliating manners with firmness of purpose. Notwithstanding his habits, he maintains his professional dignity, and commands the respect of the community, not only for his talents, but for himself. Who is more courted in society, when he chooses to enter it, and by those very men and women, too, who spend so much breath in finding fault with him, behind his back. Why, Judge, I'd rather hear him speak than any man at this bar. His language is of the pure old English—such as one gets by reading the old poets and prose writers of England—racy, pointed, and precise. His wit may be a little artificial—somewhat after the manner of a good deal of Sheridan's —far-fetched; but, then, it is often natural, and always keen and applicable. If he does not always hit the centre of the mark, he always goes near it, even when he misses, and his arrow is sent from so strong a bow, that it always sticks. He reasons clearly—the most profound subject so clearly and so simply that you do not see its profundity or its intricacies. Then, I pray you, who wins more causes than he, or who gives opinions that are oftener sustained by the court—and who can adorn a dry legal argument with so much elegant literature—and who—” “Halloo!” exclaimed Willoughby, from another part of the cellar, where himself and Selman had been drinking and laughing with Fleming, the owner of the establishment. “Let's sally out boys, and have a night of it; I feel like going my death.” “So do I,” said Selman; “let's have a real spree.” “Agreed,” said the Judge, who, though he maintained his argument consecutively, and carried his liquor discreetly, more like an old limb of the law than a young one, was overflowing, as his much talking proved. “Agreed, agreed; call me not Judge, though, gentlemen—call me not Judge; and I shall only resume my judgeship, by your leave, gentlemen, to fine any one as many glasses as we can all drink, who shall dare to disturb the joyousness and the appropriateness of this occasion by uttering the ominous word—Judge.” “A Daniel come to judgment,” exclaimed Willoughby. “Joseph Willoughby,” said Cavendish, assuming his gravest face, “the court fine you five glasses of whisky-punch, or of whatever drink any individual of this company may deem most palatable,—the court will amend their judgment, six glasses, for Fleming will drink one with us,—for transgressing the law.” “How does your Honour make that out?” asked Willoughby. “Another fine—twelve glasses,” said Cavendish. “How in the d—l do you make that out?” shouted Willoughby. “Fined again,” said Cavendish. “Joseph Willoughby, alias old Kentuck, otherwise Kentucky, the court fine you eighteen glasses—let there be silence in court while the judgment is being pronounced—and, let it be understood, that whoever shall refuse to drink his portion of the fines, shall have his nose held, as does a mother hold her child's, when she would give medicine to it, which the ignorant infant has not capacity to understand is for its own good, and take voluntarily,—shall have his nose held, and a double portion administered to him, by compulsion; the first portion, because he ought to have taken it, and the second, because he did not take the first portion willingly.” “How do you make it out?” asked Willoughby, impatiently. “Let's have the court organized,” said Bradshaw. “Cavendish, put that arm-chair on the table, and mount it, for the judgment-seat: here, I'll turn up this little table; it will do for a dock, in which to place the prisoner. Constable Emory, take charge of the prisoner, and place him in the dock, while I assist the Honourable Jonathan Cavendish, whose extreme decrepitude—the decrepitude of honourable age—requires support, to the judgment-seat. We are thankful, however, that he does not want spirit to do his duty.” “Listen, Joseph Willoughby, alias Kentuck, alias old Kentucky,” said Cavendish to Willoughby, the one seated in the arm-chair on the table, and the other standing upon the inverted table, while Emory held his collar; “listen, while the court pass sentence upon you, and let the by-standers take warning by your awful example. Were it not that the court were already, for other offences, about to fine you heavily, you should be severely fined for appearing in court in your present beastly condition—for, alas! it is too apparent that you are in such a state, that the admonition of the court will be but little heeded:—My Lord Mansfield has observed that there is no situation in which the human mind can be placed, more difficult, and more trying, than when it is made a judge in its own cause. The court do not think that they are placed in this difficult situation, described by my Lord Mansfield, though, at first blush, it would seem that they were. The law was passed, that you should not use the word judge on the present occasion; yet, no sooner was it passed, than you exclaimed—`A Daniel come to judgment.' “Now, who can pronounce the word judgement, without saying judge. For this, then, you are fined six glasses. As the court were about to pass sentence on you for your first offence, you interrupted the court, and used the word honour; now, as honour is but a synonymous word with judge, and as on this occasion we must construe the law according to the spirit, you are as clearly finable as if you had said judge. The third instance in which your are finable is, for using the word devil, and interrupting the court. Such offences as the last-named, were punishable by the common law. Therefore, Joseph Willoughby, alias Kentuck, alias old Kentucky, you are fined eighteen glasses, and let them be immediately forthcoming. The court are dry with much speaking.” “Ha! ha!” shouted Willoughby; “I will say, though I am fined again, that you're a wise judge, and I do honour thee.” “Mr. Bradshaw,” said Cavendish, with great solemnity, “do you not mean to attend to your duties? Assist the court to descend, sir.” “There's one thing I'll propose,” said Selman, while they were drinking, “that is, that we fine Bradshaw for his d—d quotations, and for spouting Tom Moore to women.” “Come, let's sally forth and have a night of it!” exclaimed two or three of the company. “Gentlemen, I protest,” said the Judge, scarcely able to stand, yet as grave as he was tipsy; “I protest, I hope that some of us—your humble servant, for instance—has a character to lose. Here's Emory, his modesty will take him out of a scrape, as no one will believe that he got intentionally into it. Here's Selman; he has an excuse in the frowns of his lady-love. It is proper, said one of the old philosophers, to drown love in wine. Old Kentuck is a privileged character; he can get drunk when he pleases. Bradshaw, keep your eyes open, and you'll be something: you have the elements of success in you; but mind your ways, and put the curb bridle on your imagination and your passions; if you don't, you'll be thrown, though you were riding Eclipse. There, I can elaborate a character, too, gentlemen. Each of you wend your several ways. What, get into a spree just from Perry's party! Why, sirs, this slanderous town will allege that we got drunk there. I fear they could prove it upon Kentuck; and what then, gentlemen of the jury? I believe I'm drunk—I've got a whole host of declarations to fill up to-morrow.—Come, Kentuck— gentlemen, the court stands adjourned sine die— this is die, though it is as dark as Egypt.” So saying, Cavendish took Willoughby's arm; the rest following, they left, not without many missteps, the cellar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. With tipsy determination, Cavendish insisted upon going home, and, after a good deal of parleying, Cavendish, Willoughby, and Emory went one way; Kentuck and Emory, Kentuck especially, making a great noise, turning over boxes, and striking his rattan against the awning-posts and houses, and Cavendish remonstrating with them on the loss of character, and the filthiness of the watch-house. Bradshaw, arm in arm with Selman, proceeded to his office, where we first introduced him to our readers. They soon reached the office, stirred up the fire and seated themselves before it. “Bradshaw,” said Selman, “I don't know what to make of you, or how to consider you:—I was a going to speak to you on this subject before we went to the party, but you spoke of the Perrys in such a manner, and you seemed to think every one must like the girls for their money and for nothing else, that—” “My dear fellow,” interrupted Bradshaw, “don't think of that: my only motive was a little innocent quizzing, and a wish to see how the fair lady stood in your good graces—as I had every reason to believe you stood well in hers.” Vol. I. 5 “Do you think so?” eagerly inquired Selman. “Why, I'll tell you what it is—just how she treats me—and I'll be blowed, if I can tell how I stand with her—sometimes I think very well, and then again her conduct is such that I'm a great mind to cut and run. The first part of this evening you saw how she treated me. Well, sir, before the evening was over, she laid me flat as a flounder.” Here Bradshaw could scarcely suppress a smile. “But, my dear fellow, you don't woo rightly. I could quote to you whole stanzas of Byron, if you were not so much opposed to quotation, the tenor of which is to show that confidence wins women, and not too many sighs.” “Sometimes I am very confident; but I don't know how to take her, and when to be confident.” “Why, you must be always confident.” “But, to tell you the truth, Bradshaw, I can't. I used to think that I could; but the moment my feelings became engaged, away with all confidence—and then she acts so inconsistently. Sometimes when I call to see her she is all smiles, and evidently prefers me to all the company; at least the fellows say so when we leave there together: then, at other times, she will be very pleasant in the beginning of the evening, or until company comes, and then, by gad, I'm of no more consequence than a pet kitten, playing with her knitting-ball.” “Have you ever made a declaration?” “Never, directly. I have often broadly hinted one; but, when I do, she commences singing, or asks me some foolish question about that booby Bates, or the ball. The other evening she was making a fancy basket with shells, after a good deal of twistification,” continued Selman, blushing at the memory, “I began the subject, and she commenced playing with the shells; when I got near the point, she asked me to snuff the lights, and worked at her basket as if life and death depended upon it. I swore to myself then, and I'll keep it—if ever she's my wife I'll pay her for it.” “First catch the fish, before you cook it, says the renowned Mrs. Glass,” observed Bradshaw. “I suppose you think it's a kittle of fish,” said Selman, rather snappishly; and, looking at Bradshaw, keenly, he continued, “Bradshaw, I begin to think you have a notion of her yourself.” At this, Bradshaw burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter. Selman made castles in the ashes for a moment or two with his rattan, and then jumping up, he exclaimed, angrily, “Mr. Bradshaw, I did not think you would treat me treacherously, and insult me in your own office into the bargain.” “Selman, it's a case with you, by the little god of love. I'd no idea you were in for it so deeply. My dear fellow, believe me, I would not wound your feelings for the world;—as there is honour in man, and changeability in woman, I have no more thought of addressing Miss Penelope than I have of making a declaration to the moon—I never had: besides, if I had, or if any one else had, in my opinion they have no chance whatever, as I really believe she has a great regard for my friend”— “What friend?” “Henry Selman.” “Do you truly think so, Bradshaw?” “I do, though it may be just such a fancy as the Judge accuses me of entertaining of Glassman.” “Oh, people say you've a great deal of penetration. Miss Penelope says so herself.” Bradshaw smiled as he went to the source of the compliment, thinking we never believe so sincerely in another's penetration, as when it flatters our hopes. Who cannot then be a Solomon, at least in the estimation of one person? “What makes you think she likes me, though?” asked Selman. “O! a thousand circumstances—the manner in which she treats you, for instance. I don't pretend to know much about the sex; yet, you know, we all form theories on the subject. I've thought of them enough, Heaven knows; though, as Sterne says, to make another quotation, `I love all the sex so much that I never could fix my affection upon one.' I've had a great deal of sickness in my life, and I've been very much thrown among women. I have tried to read them as I try to read men; but this is between you and me and your rattan. The human heart is the great book, Selman: I am convinced, if we could only read it rightly,” (Bradshaw continued, speaking in a kind of soliloquy, as if in his own thoughts he had forgotten his companion's presence,) “it is the key to the inner temple, where the crown of success is kept; get this knowledge of the world, this key, and you may pass into the temple and crown yourself. I don't know—I sometimes think the more a man studies it, the more he is perplexed. It is genius—a gift. A man must be born with bumps that way, as a phrenologist would say. It is intuition—an instinct; but this instinct may be made acuter by practice. What would I not give,” said Bradshaw, opening a book, and reading aloud several lines from it, “to read mankind as I can read that book—to have their hearts in my hands,”—and then throwing the book roughly from him, as if he was angry with himself at betraying a train of feeling which Selman's compliment to his penetration, at which he had but a moment before smiled, had called up, he said, “I suspect you yield too much to her.” “Yield to her! Why, I always yield to her!” “You do, hey! Well, there's such a thing, I know, as stooping to conquer, but you must not stoop too low.” “How, then?” “Why, Selman, I've never been in love; therefore I don't know how low I should stoop if I were—but this is my theory on the subject. I fear that those who can theorize best in love, as well as in other matters, practise worst. However, if I were in your place, and could so far master my feelings, I would go more into general society; to be admired by many women is, perhaps, the best way of securing the love of one. I would not be 5* too humble. I would give my heart away, as if I valued the gift; not as if I meant to steal another, but as if I expected a fair exchange and no robbery—though an exchange which it was my fondest, my most cherished hope to make; which should be received with gratitude, and treasured with love, and held far dearer to me than aught else in the world. When a man is deeply in love, he has a hard task to win his mistress, unless the flame were simultaneously inspired. He has so much in his own emotions to contend with—hope, distrust, jealousy—that he cannot adapt himself to her, and practise those consummate arts by which women are won. He is so much possessed with his own feelings, that he forgets to watch hers: and, besides, we judge others' feelings from our own, so often, that we are always forming erroneous opinions of them, particularly in the affairs of the heart. This is the reason why a man of the world is always more successful in love than other men. He has self-control. He studies the character and learns the feelings of his lady-love, and with Protean power he adapts himself to her. Othello, the Moor—the blackamoor— bore himself proudly, yet he “took the pliant hour;” and do you doubt he had been looking out for it with a soldier's watchfulness? Richard the Third bore himself daringly, even in the depth of his humility: when he knelt, he stooped to conquer; but it was the stooping of the eagle, who is sure of the dove. I always thought there was something unnatural in this play, that the gentle Lady Anne should be won, at her husband's funeral, by his murderer. But see Booth in the tyrant, and you think it natural—he plays so cunningly. Hudibras is a caricature; but, though it be, it is rather too true a picture of the class of lovers who are not the successful ones.” “Bradshaw, these are but fictitious illustrations. You were speaking of men of the world being the most successful. Othello was no man of the world; Hudibras was in his wooing, for he sought the jointure. Othello was successful; Hudibras not— Hudibras! he's no illustration at all of any thing but a low, poor devil, who was drawn to be laughed at.” “I know it; but it is the justness of the ridicule that makes us laugh. There is human nature in it, as there is human nature in Shakespeare's lowest clowns: the lover, for instance, of sweet Anne Page —`if she had been a boy, he wouldn't have had her, though he had married her.' Whatever is in us, in common with such characters—and we all have something in us, in common with them—we must suppress. Othello's manliness made Desdemona forget his visage,—for the dangers he had passed, she loved him; he loved her because she pitied them. She clung to his manly nature for support, as the beautiful honey-suckle of the woods clings to the generous oak. So with Lucy Ashton and Ravenswood, in `The Bride of Lamermoor.' Scott is next to Shakspeare in the knowledge of the human heart. Think of Marmion and his page. In which of Scott's poems is it, I forget, `The Lady of the Lake' or `Rokeby,' that the lover woos the heroine, and with such sweet verses! She followed his request, and twined the cypress wreath for him. Look at `Don Juan,' —Byron's best production,—the best of the age, in spite of its licentiousness. Look at `Sardanapalus,' the luxurious Sardanapalus, whom Ionian Myrrha loves; she speaks of having `fallen in her own thoughts by loving this soft stranger.' She does not love him for his softness, but for the manliness and bravery that shine through it, like the lightning in a summer's eve. You reply to me that this is all poetry, and that these instances are rare, and, in the common-place world, we don't meet with them. I know it. In the common-place world we seldom meet with love, either.” In these conversations, our readers observe that Bradshaw commences with reference to Selman; but that his feelings lead him to express his own thoughts and opinions, with scarcely a consciousness, on his part, of what originated the conversation. Our readers must also remember that the evening had been, to him, one of various excitement, intellectual and animal—that his frame was delicate, and his passions inflammable, to the highest degree. “Ah! but, Bradshaw, give me living instances.” “What, do you mean of men who have lived? Look at Julius Cæsar, the greatest man that ever lived—so say Lord Bacon and Lord Byron, the lord of philosophers and the lord of poets. He dared as much, to win Cleopatra, as he did when he crossed the Rubicon; he stayed in dalliance with her, until he nearly lost his life. He won a woman, as he won a victory, by daring to win. He had the quality which Napoleon so well, metaphorically, exprssed, and which, no doubt, he thought his own quality—`The iron hand, with the velvet glove.' Just so was it with Mirabeau: `Wait till I shake my boar's head at them,' he used to say, when he heard the hootings of the Jacobins. To a lady who had fallen in love with him, from hearing of him, he wrote, in reply to an inquiry as to his personal appearance, `Fancy a tiger who has had the small-pox; but,' he used to say, `you have no idea of the beauty of my deformity.' In spite of all his vices, he succeeded with men and women. How? By energy, energy, energy! If I were a heathen, I would build a temple to energy—enshrine the god there, and worship him. But, understand me, I would cover the iron hand with the velvet glove. Not until it was absolutely necessary, should any pressure be felt, but the soft, persuasive one, that would lead. But, when it was necessary, I would grasp with the power of Hercules, though it were the Nemean lion; but, mark me, I would not wear the lion's skin as a garment: it is what Hercules did, I know—but it is what the ass did, also. So many asses bray, now-a-days, from the lion's covering, that the world almost always suspect, when they see the covering, that the ass is under it.” “What has this to do with love?” asked Selman. “Why, a great deal: if Milton—I don't justify his tyranny—had been a kneeling lover, think you he ever would have been knelt to by his wife? What did Miss Chaworth care for Byron, when he was an unknown, `poor, lame boy,' as she called him. We all know how much she cared for him afterwards, when Byron had bearded his critics, and, in spite of them, reached the pinnacle. She sought to see him then, though wedded, mind you, to the very man for whom she rejected `the lame boy.' I know every man can't be a Byron, or a Milton; but we are not fools, Selman, and we must win our way. Mind what I tell you; the way to win is not by yielding in the crowd and press of men: if you yield, you will be trodden on; if you push on, men will think that the prize is yours—the timid will give up at once, and the stout of heart quail, if your heart be only stouter than theirs. But you must not brag, sir; the courage must be in the eye and the voice, in the self-possession of the head and the heart. Think of the disinherited knight, at the tournament at Ashby; he entered the list without any one to say `God speed you;' he strikes the shield of Brian de Bois Guilbert, till it rings again; he meets the proudest of the templars, and hurls him to the dust. This is fiction—yes! but it is glorious fiction. Read the eight volumes of Plutarch's lives: they are filled with such fiction. Read the history of Richelieu, of De Retz, of Mirabeau, of the Man of Destiny. Read the history of England's great ones: of Marlborough, of Wolsey, of Milton, of Shakspeare, of Chatham, (Jove! how he hurled defiance at Walpole,) of Sheridan, of Erskine, (how he came out in his first effort,) and Curran, (how he braved the minions of office,)—think of these men: they entered the lists on the theatre of the wide world, like the disinherited knight, and, when the odds pressed hard upon them, fortune came to their rescue—as she will always come to the rescue of the valiant, like the black sluggard to the rescue of Ivanhoe. Look at our own country: at Washington, at our more than Demosthenes, Patrick Henry, (what self-sustainment there was about him, even in the depth of obscurity and poverty,) and at Roger Sherman, and a host of others, who gather in our history as our stars increase and cluster in our banner. Yes,” said Bradshaw, rising and walking up and down the room, “these men, and such like them, are the `gods of my idolatry.' Some one remarks, Dr. Channing, I believe, that the reason why we admire even the Father of all Evil, the Satan of Milton, is because of the energy he exhibits, and the firmness with which, amidst the `burning marl,' he sustained himself. We cannot but admire this trait of character, though in a fiend—how much more in god-like men! And if they be fallen men, and display this trait, it is a proof that all of their original brightness has not fled—ay, it is the power with which they often win back their original brightness. This world, sir, is like the hackneyed fable of Hercules and the wagoner: he called on Hercules for help, but the god told him to help himself first, to put his shoulder to the wheel, and then to pray. If you would reach the high places in this world—if you would get out of the slough, you must help yourself, and then the world will play Hercules and help you— but not till then. But, come, let us to bed—'tis after three. Turn in there, Selman, and may all the dreams that hover round the fortunate lover, be yours.” “First catch the fish, though, as you say,” exclaimed Selman. “I know that,” replied Bradshaw; “but, sir, if you do not bait your hook, and throw it into the waters, how will you ever catch your fish? You have had a nibble, a glorious nibble, at any rate, Selman; and that, you know, is the premonitory symptom of a bite;—and may the biter be bit—I don't mean in the vulgar sense of the proverb: I mean, may she be caught.” Long after Selman's head was upon his pillow in an undisturbed and dreamless sleep, in spite of Miss Penelope, Bradshaw was up, with his books before him, not in study, but in a state of restlessness. For a few moments he would glance over the life of Cæsar, Themistocles, Napoleon, or Chatham, or look into a poem, or stir his fire, or sit in abstraction and gaze upon the various forms which the burning coal assumed. An observer of his countenance would soon have discovered in him the throes and excitement of a deep ambition—an ambition self-sustained and determined, yet restless and anxious for action— a character formed in common mould—one, who, even in his most wayward moments, felt a fixedness of purpose, that longed, at least, to try its energies in another field than that of the imagination.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. The sun was up some hours, before Bradshaw left his room; when he did, it was noiselessly, so as not to disturb Selman. He went forth to take exercise, in the hope of alleviating a severe headach. In returning from a long walk, he met Cavendish and Willoughby, strolling along towards the court-house, and joined them. “The top of the morning to you, Bradshaw,” said Willoughby. “The top is toppling down towards the meridian,” said Cavendish. “But where's Selman?” “I left him, nearly an hour since, at my office, fast asleep,” replied Bradshaw. “The deuce you did!” exclaimed Cavendish. “I should have supposed he would have been long ago chewing the cud of bitter or sweet memory, according as Miss Penelope frowned or smiled last night.” “The fact is, Selman is completely in for it. I could not help laughing at him last night,—he looked, to me, exactly like Jefferson's Tony Lumpkin, when his mother `snubbed him,”' remarked Bradshaw. “He's a good-natured fellow,” said Willoughby. Vol. I. 6 “He will never make a fortune; yet he has no spendthrift habits. I wish he could get that girl—he is really attached to her; and, then, the old man has fortune enough; beside, some spendthrift of a fool may run away with her some of these days. I don't believe she could make a better match.” “How old is Selman?” asked Cavendish. “He told me, the other day, that he was twenty-two,” replied Bradshaw. “He intends going into business for himself in a short time. I'm told he's an excellent book-keeper, and that he has a good deal of business tact.” “If that be the fact, I should not think old Perry would veto him,” said Willoughby. “The old man has not the veto power—it belongs to the other side of the house,” remarked Bradshaw. “He's afraid of Bates,” remarked Cavendish. “Bates thinks that the world was made for him, and all that he has to do is to smile upon the lady to win her. He only wants to cut Selman out, and gratify a contemptible vanity. I don't think he means to address her.” “I tell you what it is, gentlemen, all,” said Bradshaw, half quizically, “let us turn conspirators, and bring the matter about: it can be done. Let us make a public opinion on the subject—tell all the women what a fine fellow Selman is— how much he is admired by their sex and by ours; and let us all be sure to let Miss Penelope know that there are several ladies who, we have every reason to believe, are very much taken with him. We must puff him up to one another before the old man; and we must not forget, often to talk of his good family, and his respect for his mother, before the old lady. It is not, perchance, the thing to plot such manœuvres, except upon such occasions. But, recollect, gentlemen, to work surely we must work secretly—that is, we must not blab the business. Just for the joke of the affair, as well as to do Selman a service, let us see if we can't succeed.” “Agreed! agreed!” shouted Willoughby. “Bradshaw,” said the Judge, “that's a good notion; when I go a wooing, I'll come to you for advice. I won't let you plead the case for me to the lady, for there I would not trust you; but I'll get you to make a little public opinion for me. In the mean time, take care that some one does not make a little public opinion on you, about your manner of spending your evenings.” In such conversation, arm in arm, the young men entered the court-house. Some common case occupied the attention of the court, and, after listening carelessly to the trial for a few minutes, and speaking with his different acquaintances of the party of the previous evening, &amp;c., Bradshaw quit his companions to go to his office. As Bradshaw was leaving the court-room, Mr. Tompson, a member of the bar, came up to him with Mr. Glassman—the gentleman about whose character, our readers may remember, he had been disputing with Cavendish, at the oyster cellar—and, after introducing him to Glassman, left them together. “Mr. Bradshaw,” said Glassman, “to defend the absent has always been esteemed a virtue; though not absent last evening, when you so eloquently defended and complimented me—I am not the last criminal, I suspect, sir, whom you will eloquently defend;—yet it was a generous offering to one, sir, whom you thought absent—whom you did not personally know. Permit me to say, sir, it gives me more pleasure to make your acquaintance than any I have made for years: I hope we may be better acquainted; though I feel, in that better acquaintance, I may lose the good opinion which you have been pleased to express of me.” “Were you present, sir?” inquired Bradshaw, perfectly astonished. “Yes, sir; I was in the number in which, you may remember, one of your friends remarked there was a light.” “I assure you, Mr. Glassman, that my friend spoke as he did merely for the sake of argument; and he would not, on any consideration, so have expressed himself, if he had known you were within.” “I believe it, sir; but don't speak in that way; it forces on me too strongly the conviction, that you spoke for argument too. I assure you, sir, that I am not the least hurt with Mr. Cavendish.—But, come, let us walk down street.” So saying, Glassman placed his arm in Bradshaw's; and they entered the street. Glassman was truly an accomplished and intellectual man. The commendation which Bradshaw had bestowed on him was, perhaps, not undeserved. He was a man to please Bradshaw; and ere they parted, Bradshaw had accepted, with pleasure, an invitation to dine with him on that day. “I keep bachelor's hall,” said Glassman, “and you must come early. In the same house with my office I have a suite of rooms; and I try to congregate there the comforts that one of my means and habits can gather round him. I like to have as many inducements to keep me at my office, and near my business as possible. I feel happiest when I am engaged in business, or conversing with a friend; so do not fail me. I shall expect you at two.” After Glassman and Bradshaw parted, Bradshaw called on Miss Carlton. She was at home and alone. “Mary, how did you enjoy yourself last night?” “Oh, very much, indeed. I spent a delightful evening.” “So did I. I have come this morning to be disenchanted—but in vain. I used to think that, if a gentleman was struck with a lady's surpassing loveliness at an evening party, he should call on her the next morning, when the gayety and adornment of the party were over, if he meant to pursue his studies with any thing like a determination of retaining a single idea of what he was reading. But you are one of those who, Thomson would say, was now `adorned the most.”' “You sinner!” exclaimed the laughing, blushing Mary; “I'm going to make some morning calls, and you must go with me. Wait till I put on my bonnet. I am determined, if I stay in town, and while I stay, you shall not be such a recluse as you have been.” 6* “Let me assist you, Mary—there—to fix a lady's bonnet is the poetry of life. I've tied it in a double beau. Here's your shawl, 'tis a beautiful one—let me arrange it with the end a little to one side. It looks better so; there is a carelessness about it which has fascination in its folds. Now, lady, as I am not much of a beau, you must remember I am under your especial patronage.” “You are a politician in your courtesy; you assume least where you know you have the most power. If I were to tell you all the compliments I heard paid to you last night, you would not forget them for a twelvemonth.” “Suppose I were to tell you all I heard paid to you—I can repeat them all by heart.” “There; a compliment again. I shall never know when to believe you sincere. If a girl had a lover like you, she would never know when to believe him. He would have to protest very hard when he made his declaration.” Here, Miss Carlton blushed, and quickly said, “Clinton, you don't look as well as you did when you lived in the country: you look very thin. Do you study hard, or do you—” “Dissipate, Mary? Not much, nor study much either. Let me see: yes, 'tis just three months to-day—this very day—since I last saw you. Do you discover that I have grown thin? There are many causes for thinness, you know. Well, I never saw you look better. I suppose, you enjoyed yourself very much.” “No; I did not a great deal: I would rather have been at home. Father was talking politics all the time, and I saw belles and beaux a plenty, but they were merely casual acquaintances, and one never enjoys oneself in such society; at least, I never could.” “Do you go to Washington City this winter?” “Father wishes me to go, but I tell him I am too young yet, and that I would rather remain at home—I mean in town here—and attend to my music masters and my teachers, for that I only consider myself a school girl as yet. What do you think about it?” “I think about it! Upon my word, you compliment me. Like you, I consider myself as yet but at school—and, Mary, I am much too selfish to wish my old schoolmate away,—even, to tell you the truth, though I thought she would like the holiday. If she does not like it, why then the selfishness is justified.” “The old school-house on the top of the hill! I passed by it yesterday; Mr. Lusby came to the door and stopped the carriage. He told me not to forget to thank you for him for the books you sent him.” “He's a fine old gentleman.” “Indeed he is; and he takes much pride in his scholars. He said, if you only had paid more attention to the Latin and the mathematics, he would have had no fault to find with you, bating a little occasional laziness,” said Miss Carlton, archly. “Laziness! yes; he used to lecture me for that often, and tell me it was my besetting sin. Do you remember the time I caught you crying over little Red Ridinghood. I looked through the window at you—it was in play-time—for a minute before you saw me. You had your hair pushed back—you were leaning with your cheeks on your open hands, with the book before you:—the tears were streaming down your cheeks.” “I remember it well, and how furiously you fought Joseph Sloan, who was a much larger boy than yourself, for hissing at me, when he saw me crying. Mr. Clinton, do you know, sir, that you have a very ferocious countenance, when you are in a passion?” “Have I?” “Yes, you have—and you must quit scowling so. I observed you once or twice last night: when any one, who did not know you, would have thought that you were angry. Let us turn around this corner—I am going to Mr. Perry's.” “What! is it fashionable to call the morning after a party?” “O, I know the girls very well, and I promised them, last night, that I would call this morning.” “What kind of a girl is Miss Penelope?” “A very fine girl; she's kind-hearted and amiable, and as accomplished as most girls: if I may dare to say it, perhaps, she is too fond of admiration. If she had a lover, she would require a great many attentions.” “Pray, who of your gentle sex does not; and what lover would not give them?” “Certainly; what lover would not give them? but I thought you, gentlemen, would make a voluntary offering, where you would not pay an extorted tribute.” “What do you think of Mr. Selman, Mary?” “What—the gentleman who came with you last night? I like him very much, what little I've seen of him. He was very attentive to Penelope.” “Very.” “Do you think he is pleased with Penelope?” “Don't you think Penelope is pleased with him?” “I hope no lady would show a preference for a gentleman, until that gentleman has shown that he preferred her,” said Miss Carlton, quickly, with a slight blush. “O, certainly not,” replied Bradshaw, “but you have already observed that he showed a preference for her.” “I believe she does like him, and, also, that she likes to torment him a little.” Bradshaw smiled. “Which is the best way, do you think, Mary, for a lover to treat such a lady?” “Indeed, I do not know; I should ask you that question.” “No, indeed; I should ask you—no man can understand your sex as well as yourselves.” “Now, there, sir, you are wrong: we girls differ as much from ourselves as we differ from you.” “Well, Mary, I have reason to believe that Selman is attached to Miss Penelope; and, if you like him, speak a good word for him.” “Certainly, I will, if it will do any good. I really think she likes him.” They here arrived at and entered Mr. Perry's house. They found Miss Penelope alone, and looking her best, notwithstanding the excitement and worryment of the previous evening, which, as one of the entertainers, she must have experienced. “Miss Penelope,” said Bradshaw, “I was telling Miss Carlton how well she looked this morning, and I may say the same to you. Your party was such a delightful one, that, instead of exhausting one's spirits, as parties generally do, it has renovated them.” “I am truly glad to hear that you enjoyed yourself.” “O, very much, indeed,” said Miss Carlton. “Yes,” observed Bradshaw, “every body appeared to enjoy themselves. Did you observe, too, what a great beau Henry Selman is getting to be?” “No, I did not. Is he?” asked Miss Penelope. “Quite so, I assure you,” replied Bradshaw. “Miss Carlton and myself were speaking of him as we came here. I thought Miss Sutherland, last night, was very much disposed to be merciful to him.” “Merciful! how? what do you mean?” asked Miss Penelope. “Why, not cruel. I think he stands A, number one there. O, Miss Penelope, what a beautiful fancy basket! Did you work it?” “Yes, sir.” “Really, you must suffer me to compliment you on it. We were speaking, last night, of the different ornaments of the kind possessed by you ladies, and Selman warmly maintained that yours was, by far, the handsomest of all—he is a man of fine taste.” “Yes, sir, I believe he is a gentleman of taste,” said Miss Penelope, looking very thoughtfully into the fire; “but I did not observe that he was very attentive to Miss Sutherland—was he?” “He went home with her,” said Bradshaw. “Miss Penelope,” he continued, “you know, I suppose, that Miss Carlton will not go to Washington this winter.” “Yes, I know she does not; and, as the country will be very dreary in the winter, she will, of course, spend it with us. I think we shall have a very gay winter: there will be the theatre and the balls—O! I long for the balls to commence; they do, next Thursday—and the parties, and, I suppose, we shall have a wedding or two. Miss Carlton, you will enjoy yourself as much here as you would in Washington.” “I have no doubt I should enjoy myself more,” replied Miss Carlton. “I like to be among those whom I know well;—that constitutes the enjoyment, I think, and not the mere party or the ball.” In this, and similar calls, Miss Carlton and her companion passed the morning; he left her only in time to keep his appointment with Glassman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. Glassman lived near the “west end” of the city, in a by-street leading to it, that was not much frequented. A few steps bore him from a kind of retirement, to the glitter and magnificence of wealth and fashion. Bradshaw soon reached his residence, and entered his office, which was in the front room of the house. Passing into the back room, he found Mr. Glassman with a book of poems in his hand, that he had been perusing. “Walk in, Mr. Bradshaw; be seated, sir. I passed you in the street after we parted; but you were so closely engaged in conversation with your fair companion, that you did not observe me. I think she is the loveliest and most agreeable lady of her age, I ever beheld. I met her lately, and had some chat with her; I don't know when I have been so delightfully entertained. She is the only daughter, I believe, of Mr. Carlton?” While Mr. Glassman spoke, he eyed his companion with the close scrutiny of a man of the world. With an easy manner, Bradshaw replied—“Yes, sir, the only daughter. Any eulogy which may be pronounced on Miss Carlton will be deserved; though I am four or five years the older, yet I remember her as long as I remember myself. We were early school-mates, and she is very intimate with my sister.” “Ay, well, sir, be careful that the sex do not allure you from your studies. And, yet, I do not know why we should not wish to yield to their allurements: I have no doubt that youth is the happiest period of our life—and why not yield to its bias and impressions, as the leaf, upon the stream, floats as the wind bloweth.” “I should not suppose, sir, that you would preach that doctrine.” “The preachment and the practice are not always the same—but you know we cannot say which is the best part of the road until we have travelled it. I do not know but what our profession—from our habit of disputation in the defence of any side— leads us very much into doubting; makes us specious reasoners, and wayward actors. I won't say that in a dull man, who pursues closely and exclusively the practice of the profession, this effect is produced; but one who is a general reader—who has a taste for polite literature, and who cultivates it, is very apt to be thus influenced.” “But, sir,” remarked Bradshaw, “do you not believe that Erskine and Curran, if they had been followers of literature, would have been more devoted to pleasure than they were, and that Sheridan, if he had been a lawyer, would have been less so. Sheridan thought so himself, I believe, from the fact of his having wished towards the close of his life, that he had studied law: `I would have done, at least, as well,' said he, `as Tom Erskine.”' Vol. I. 7 “I remember having seen something like that recorded of Sheridan. Old Sherry paid himself as great a compliment as he ever had paid to him, when he uttered that remark. Take him all in all, sir, I consider Erskine the most accomplished advocate that ever spoke the English language. I was educated in England, and I have had the pleasure of hearing him and most of his contemporaries, Fox, Burke, Sheridan, Pitt, &amp;c. I do not think that Erskine was much of a statesman;—facts prove, indeed, that he comparatively failed in the House of Commons; but I believe he would have made a better statesman than either of his contemporaries could have made advocates, if I may institute such a comparison, and if they had been advocates they would not have equalled him. He was a fine-looking man, and a most accomplished gentleman, and then he had every weapon of oratory at command. His argument was lucid; I was about to say Johnsonian, but there was more naturalness in it, if I may so express myself, than there was in that of the great lexicographer, owing to his analogy and illustrations being derived from simpler sources—more from nature, not so much from books. He never used his imagination merely to adorn— his most brilliant adornment contained illustration and argument: here he differed widely from Curran, who often let his imagination run away with him, a complete John Gilpin frolic, leaving his admirers as much amazed as were the folks of Islington, wondering, too, what he was after. Fox, as an advocate, would have reasoned better; Pitt would have had more subtlety; Sheridan more wit —much more. Great as Erskine was in cross-examining a witness, Sheridan would have surpassed him. But admit all this, and before an English jury, in the generality of cases, Erskine would have excelled them. Burke I never considered an orator. Sometimes, from the violence of his temper, in very madness, like the Pythoness, he would be eloquent in utterance—in language, he always was eloquent—but he often wanted true oratorical inspiration, and lamely affected, acted it; as when, for instance, he drew from his pocket a dagger, which, no doubt, he had pocketed for the occasion, and flourished it in such a histrionic manner.” “My political impressions have been such,” replied Bradshaw, “as to lead me to think that Burke was more splendid than profound; and yet who does not admire the lofty enthusiasm with which he pours forth his whole soul for the ancient regime? With a holy devotion, Old Mortality, as Scott describes him, leaned over the tombs of the departed covenanters, to revive their names upon the marble; with a similar feeling, Burke would clear away what he calls rubbish, foulness, and degradation from the old monarchy of France—like the antiquary, he washes the relic, and finds it a common stone; he had better have been like the other antiquary, who refused to wash what he pronounced an ancient shield, for fear it would prove to be a pot-lid. Yet I admire him; I think him, perhaps, the master spirit of his day.” “No, indeed, sir; you are wrong, you are wrong. I know that the generality of scholars would agree with you, and be disposed to laugh at me; but I have lived long enough in the world to dare to think for myself. I admire Burke's brilliant imagination. He was meant for a literary character, if nature ever means a man for any thing. I am no defender of the French revolution—I mean of its atrocities—but I often think of what Paine said of Burke, that `He pitied the plumage, and forgot the dying bird.' Burke, sir, in my opinion, dressed the iron hand of despotism in flowers, and then exclaimed, how beautiful! The serpent which had stolen into the lily of France, and become torpid there, he would have you place in your bosom and warm into life. He seems to say, “It hath no sting, it is incapable of ingratitude: I know the fable says the contrary, but what's a fable!” He would present that lily to you poisoned with that serpent's contact, and with one of his best bows, request my dear sir, or miss, or madam, that you would wear it as a nosegay. Burke enthrones prejudice on the ruins of some old feudal tower, and then would have the world bow down to it in political idolatry. He reminds us of the heathen, who makes unto himself an idol and then worships it—no small portion of his worship proceeding from a reverence of his own handiwork. He could defend all sides with equal ability, or, rather, he could defend a sophism best; for his was an imagination that did not illumine, but dazzle—not the light that enables us to see clearly and distinctly the objects before us, but the lurid blaze that flashes in the tempest —not the beacon-fire, burning on the steep, to guide the shipwrecked in safety, but its deceiving resemblance, that whelms them in ruin. Burke threw the gorgeous splendour of his imagination over the departed tyranny of France, as we throw the pall over the bier to hide the sense of the cold, distorted, blackened corpse beneath, that died in convulsions. He goes farther; he chants over it an incantation to raise the dead withal. And what spirits he would call from the `vasty deep' of despotism! Understand me; to his splendid intellect, I pay the respect of profound homage; but I believe that the most of his political acts were dictated by an uncontrollable temper; that his inspiration proceeded from his frenzy; and that his conduct towards Fox, when they differed with regard to the French revolution, was all that is censurable. That one act shows the man to my mind.” Bradshaw could not but smile at what he considered the wildest prejudices; just as he was about to reply, the servant entered to announce dinner. They dined alone: with the exception of an aged house-keeper and one servant, there was no one beside themselves in the room. The room was furnished with an austerity of taste. From the books, busts, and pictures around it, any one would have taken it for the abode of an intellectual man. After they had dined, and while they were taking their wine, Bradshaw rose, with enthusiasm, to contemplate closer a splendid bust of Chatham, which had, even during dinner, and notwithstanding the temptation of the viands and the fascination of Glassman's conversation, occupied a considerable portion of his attention. “Yes—I knew it was Chatham,” said he; “I knew it by instinct, as Falstaff knew the true 7* Prince. This is Alexander Hamilton. What a striking bust! It reminds one of the ancient heads. And this is Byron. Ah, is it a good likeness?” “Yes, sir, very much like him. It was given to me by one of his friends, Mr. —. He is almost the only great man of my day, whom I cannot say I personally knew, so far as to have had some conversation with him. I once saw Byron in the theatre; that is very much like him. I keep it for the likeness; the execution of the picture is not remarkable. I stood, unobserved, and watched him for some time; it was in Drury Lane; Kean was playing Othello. I thought him an unhappy man, and affected, though not so much so as you might imagine. His personal appearance was deeply interesting—there was that in him that would please a woman: his face was fine —intellectual in its expression, yet not devoid of sensuality; it combined, at once, manliness and beauty—there, the fulness of the chin, in the picture, is very much like—the eye is not so good; the expression of his face changed momently. I thought his hair, from its look, was indebted much to the barber for its curl. That of Alexander Hamilton is a first-rate likeness. He had quite a rosy cheek, which you would not believe from looking at that bust; he was a dressy man, too—that is, what we would call dressy now-a-days. He was, also, a great beau.” “Did you know Burr?” “Oh, yes. I saw a great deal of Burr when young—about the eye, you remind me of him. Have you never been told your eye was like his?” “Yes, sir, I believe I have.” “There is much of a resemblance; and, sir, you must know it's a high compliment. I never heard a man speak of Burr in my life, who did not speak of his eye. Your eye is more impulsive in its expression than his, if I may so express myself. His eye was keen, quick, fiery; and yet the most common observer would know him to be a man of self-control. The keenness of his look contrasted strangely with the calmness of his brow, and reminded one of the flame of the volcano bursting from the ice-bound brow of Hecla. He was a man of great personal neatness, and generally dressed in black; plain, but of the richest. He combined the gentlest and most seductive address with more command than any man I ever saw—and he was a very small man. I have heard jurymen say that they never could take their eyes off of him, when he was addressing them: each thought that Burr was looking at him. When I think of his character, I am always reminded of some of the most distinguished Italian and French politicians. Burr should have been cast in the stormy time of the French revolution; he would have equalled Talleyrand in tact, and Napoleon in energy. I believe it. His character and operations were unsuited to the simple machinery, and the honesty of our republican institutions. He did not enough wait upon events and developments—he tried too much to force them. Alexander, a prince born to power, might dare to cut the Gordian knot, which he could not untie. But, in our country, you must learn to untie it; or, if you do cut, it must not be with the daring of Alexander, nor with the exhibition of surpassing strength, as Richard the Lion-hearted,—Melec Ric,—in Scott's beautiful tale of the Talisman, cut the steel mace, when Saladin requested a display of his prowess. No! you must cut it as Saladin cut the cushion of silk and down, with sleight of hand. You must wait patiently. In this respect, Talleyrand would have excelled Burr—but in no other. In an age of great men, Burr is one of the greatest.” “I agree with you,” replied Bradshaw, “in your estimate of Burr's talents; but I think these sleight of hand tricks give one the reputation of being a political juggler, that, in our country, injures a man more than any thing else. Honesty, I conscientiously believe, is the best policy,—I mean the best selfish policy,—the policy for success.— And then it is the only policy which will console you in defeat.” “Why,” replied Glassman, “I ever mingled, but very little, in politics. I have been once or twice forced to take part in them; but, even in success, I always found the play was not worth the candle. And, then, think of its uncertainties. Now you are on the crest of the wave,—mountain high,—and the next moment you are in the slough of despond. I always preferred the even tenor of my profession. This ducking of the head to every plebeian dog you may meet, I never could, nor would do, for his vote—there is personal debasement in the thought. I would salute any man through courtesy. I applaud the sentiment of him, who replied to the reproach of one who reproved him for speaking to a negro, by the remark, `That he would not let a negro surpass him in politeness:' there is chivalry in that; I can find nothing but self-debasement in the other.” Bradshaw mused for some time, abstractedly, when Glassman interrupted him, by asking— “Who is that young man who was with you last night, named Willoughby?” “He is a Kentuckian,” replied Bradshaw, “and he possesses all the chivalry that is attributed to his country. He is a young man who expects a large fortune from his uncle, and has come here to attend the law lectures this winter. We call him, familiarly, Kentuck. He is the most truly independent and generous fellow I ever met with. He is very proud of his state, and reminds me of the preacher, who, in describing the beatitude of heaven, capped the climax by saying, `In short, my beloved brethren, heaven is a Kentuck of a place.' ”. “I like such spirits,” exclaimed Glassman. “Is he a man of talents?” “Yes, sir, a great deal of natural talent, but uncultivated, yet there is shrewd common sense, an observation of character, and an energy about him, which lead me to think, at times, that he will be a distinguished man. I am satisfied he will, if he's ever thrown in some great crisis of human affairs —then he'll either make a spoon, or spoil a hoon.” In such conversation, several hours passed. Glassman was much struck with the bearing and conversation of Bradshaw, and, when they parted, he pressed him warmly to call and see him often. “If you get into any knotty point of law,” said he, “in which I can be of any service to you, command me, don't fail to do it—or upon any point of practice,— no man can learn the practice from books. Read, rather, a few standard works thoroughly, than many promiscuously. Understand every thought of the author, as you go along. Sit and think over what you have read—think steadily, not impulsively—think long. Keep not your habits of study for your office; study as you walk the streets, here, there, everywhere. I do not mean that you should lose yourself in abstractions—by no means; but that you should observe things around you, and understand exactly their relative positions—not only things, but men, and women, too,” said Glassman, smiling. “You must keep your intellectual armour on, and always have it bright. Eschew prejudice; be not too much influenced by first impressions, but weigh them well; they are instincts, and often tell the truth. Acquire self-possession, but not heartlessness. Act towards women without one particle of foppery or affectation—be natural with them, and be gentle: they are best won, as the summer sun wins the dew from the rose, and causes its bud to blossom, gradually, with an insinuating power. When you go a wooing, make not your intentions known too soon; it throws a woman upon her guard, and she watches every avenue to her heart, arguseyed—you will have twice the toil to win her. What we win with great toil, must have rare excellencies to reward us; if it have not, we are sadly disappointed. I was going to advise you against wedding a very poor girl, but I had better warn you against a rich one: you can make money, if you try; and your wife will not only love, but respect you, if she owes all to you:—if you owe all to her, why, she must not only love, but respect you, very much, if you do not often hear of your indebtedness. But marry for love, be she rich, or be she poor. You think this strange advice from me, don't you? It is good advice. I could read you a homily on it with a sad moral. You are a young man of penetration, Mr. Bradshaw, of sagacity—cultivate it: 'tis better than all the books that ever were written. Books tell us what has been, just as a man would tell us—and both books and men may distort and misrepresent: sagacity sees through them. In your intercourse with men, treat them with all courtesy, but not sycophancy. Be rather too proud than too humble. Understand which way men's interests lead them, and observe them in little things. Many a man braces himself up to heroism in great things, who is no hero at all. Perhaps his heroism is forced upon him, as courage is forced on a cornered rat; he acts well upon compulsion, and obtains a reputation for it that lasts him through life, which he no more deserves than would the rat a reputation for courage. Practise oratory: in our country it is more powerful than the two-edged sword in the strong hand, in battle. Read the old English authors; they are the best—their thoughts are the solid metal: the moderns have hammered it out. Be natural in your speaking, and have a manner of your own. Obtain self-possession, and the power of looking far a-head, while you speak; see your way through before you start. Never go on at a venture, unless you know your subject, and then 'tis no venture, because you are like the pilot who knows the whereabout of the quicksand, and sees the shore.” “That is a man of talents, of glorious talents,” thought Bradshaw, when he left Glassman; “but, perhaps, he wants vim a little; he thinks too much about side-blows; his bump of caution must be prodigious—yet, he's a man of great experience, and he thinks most acutely. Why did not Chesterfield succeed as eminently as Chatham? Chesterfield was a man of talents; no one knew the world better; but he wanted energy—or, rather, he was too cautious to go a-head much; he was afraid of so many side hits, and back hits, that he was always looking around, and about him, to see exactly how he stood; he never thought of advancing till it was too late—till he saw some one before him. Chatham had too much pride; several times it nearly wrecked him, and it often marred his influence; but, by Jove, if Chatham had had as much caution as Chesterfield, he never would have been as distinguished a man as the Earl of Stanhope. Here's a day gone, and I've not read one line—last night at the party, too. Mary looked well; I never saw her look better. This morning, what a delightful walk! Mr. Clinton Bradshaw, you must quit these vanities; they are idlesse, all. What good will they do you a year hence? But I've spent the day profitably. To my books, to my books; I must get into that chapter on executory devises, and puzzle through what my Lord Thurlow says on it. I must stop at the library, however, and have some new novel to qualify it. I'll take no supper, but straight to my office. I agree with Mr. Glassman in a good many of his notions, but he has too bad an opinion of men and of women. He's a man that thinks for himself, though. When I heard him express his sentiments on Burke, I thought he must surely be a Jacobin, but he is rather aristocratical in his views. I suspect that he is, personally, aristocratical, and, politically, republican.” At night, and long after Bradshaw heard the raps of different of his friends at his office door, but they were unanswered. The watchman cried past twelve under his window, before he quit his legal studies, notwithstanding his dissipation of the previous night. Then he ensconced himself in bed, with the light placed at his bed-head, and it was not until he had glanced through the fashionable novel he had obtained at the library, that he composed himself on his pillow to sleep.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. I. 8 CHAPTER VII. Bradshaw's father, as we have observed, lived about five miles in the country, on a farm which had been in his family for several generations— since the early settlement of this part of the country. It was situated near the city. It consisted of two hundred acres; the most of which was in a state of high cultivation—the rest in wild woodlands. Mr. Bradshaw, Clinton's father, whose Christian name was David, tilled it himself, assisted by a few slaves. The farm lay between two roads which led from the city, and was known throughout the whole county as the “Pilgrim's Purchase;” this title having been given to it by its first proprietor, who named it in honour of his forefathers. The house was an old-fashioned one, of but one story, built of large gray stone, with a long, projecting roof, very thick walls, and long, narrow windows. It was built on the top of a hill, which gently sloped to a plain, that spread out in a beautiful meadow. Immediately at the foot of the hill, the ground was rough, and full of small rocks, that, in some places, projected several feet above it. A beautiful, small stream wound among the rocks and glided off to the south, where its waters were greatly augmented. Over the stream, which was called sometimes the Branch, and sometimes Bradshaw's Branch, or Carlton's Branch, according to its location and to the names of the owners of the property through which it passed, though it generally bore its first-named title, grew in some places trees of great size, to which numbers of wild grape-vines clung, stretching through the whole tree, and sometimes falling from its branches in luxuriant clusters. In other places, (we are speaking of that part of the stream seen from Mr. Bradshaw's house,) it glided through unshaded banks, except here and there a knot of wild brushwood. To the left of the house was a fine garden, and near it a noble barn, along the eaves of which boxes were fixed, in which innumerable martens built their nests in summer. Near, were all the necessary out-houses of a well-stocked farm; and they all had an ancient appearance. Around the house was a number of noble oaks, beneath which the grass grew long, and of the darkest green. Behind the house was a large grove, from which, with great care, Mr. Bradshaw had had all the under-growth cleared, and every spring the leaves were carefully removed, so that the soil formed a beautiful turf, in many places for yards. Around the foot of some of the largest oaks grew a beautiful moss, of a silky softness, which sometimes crept up the trees. Imbosomed in the grove, and half hid by the trees, the white palings of the family grave-yard could be seen. Every thing about the Pilgrim's Purchase wore an air of rural comfort and careful husbandry. The fences were all good, and here and there the prying eye would discover a horse-shoe a-straddle of the rail or a bit of iron, which had been picked up in ploughing, thrust into the hole of the post. The fruit-trees were properly trimmed, and away down in the meadow, the hay-stacks were raised and strictly guarded with a temporary fence. The appearance of the farm and house was very much in keeping with the character of their owner. Mr. Dayid Bradshaw was a plain, fine-looking, old farmer, of the methodist persuasion, and strictly pious: he was one of the best neighbours and firmest friends in the country round. His ancestors had always maintained a most respectable standing, which had given to the family a popularity and influence, when they chose to exert them, which was rarely, that had not diminished in his hands. In all affairs of interest to his neighbourhood, Mr. Bradshaw took an unobtrusive, but influential part. He got up the project, and carried it through, of building a country church near by. He was mild, yet decided: any one who knew the father would recognise the son, from the family likeness; though the father had none of the ardour, and fiery energy of his child. The parent's example, however, had done much to give the son self-control. Mrs. Bradshaw, the mother of Clinton, had been a lady remarkable for her personal beauty, her gentle manners, and her intelligence. She took great pride in the proper management of her household; and though in her dress the plainest lady in the neighbourhood, for, like her husband, she was a methodist, yet the carriages of her fashionable neighbours were as often seen at her door as at any other. Her marriage was a love-match: her father was a worldly man, who had been wealthy, and who lost none of his high notions with his wealth; he was very much displeased with his daughter, who was an only child, and motherless, for marrying a “farming drudge,” as he used to call Mr. Bradshaw; but, in his old age, when deprived of every thing, his greatest solace and comfort, next to the society of his daughter, was that of her husband, under whose roof he died. There was another inmate of the Pilgrim's Purchase whom we must not forget—Emily Bradshaw, the sister of Clinton. Emily Bradshaw and Mary Carlton had been friends from their childhood. Emily was a year or more the older, but they had grown up together, and all their early associations were with each other and Clinton. Her form was slender and delicate: she had the intellectual expression and cast of features of her brother, but they were softened into womanly meekness and beauty. She was as gentle as the dove; and her life had glided along so far, like the stream before her paternal door—calmly bright—looking up to heaven and reflecting its beauty: but she had that acutely sensitive temperament, that is feelingly alive to the ills of others; with any and every one's distress she truly sympathized; thus, though her life passed without sorrow of her own, she felt the sorrow of others, and had experienced, in this way, the vanities of life. Spending much of her time only in the society of her mother, she had ample time for reading, of which she availed herself. Every book of any interest was obtained for her by her brother; and, as he frequently rode out to 8* the farm, and spent the night there, and almost every Sunday; for he loved to go to the country church, and meet his old friends, they frequently saw each other, and the conversation was often on books. In this way, Emily's taste for reading was strengthened and improved. Behind Mr. Bradshaw's house, through the woods, about half a mile, stood the splendid mansion of the Hon. Samuel Carlton, the father of the young lady who has been already introduced to our readers. His estate was very large, and he lived, apparently, in great magnificence, with the occasional display of ostentatious hospitality; but he was money-making and rather close; very wordly, and possessed of considerable talents. He was exceedingly ambitious of political distinction, and it gave him no slight trouble to curb certain points in his temper and character, which, if indulged, he was aware, would not contribute to his popularity. He had held, for several years, a seat in Congress. His origin was humble, and not known in the city where we open this narrative. When commencing life, he had emigrated to it, and commenced the practice of the law. He soon after ran away with an heiress of one of the first families, and possessed of one of the largest fortunes in the state, who died in giving birth to Mary Carlton, their only child. Mr. Carlton remained a widower, and gradually retired from practice, devoting his time to speculations in property with the money he received from his deceased wife, and to politics. He acquired an immense fortune. Mr. Carlton was what you would call a fine-looking man; portly, with regular features, but a narrow forehead, and a rather small, but keen, eye. In his personal appearance he was very neat. His wife's maiden name was Holliday, a connexion of the Hollidays of whom Bradshaw and Mrs. Perry spoke at that lady's party. They were one of the oldest, wealthiest, and most respectable families in the state; one of the Hollidays held a high judicial station under the colonial government of George the Third. They were very much displeased with their relative for her marriage with Mr. Carlton, and all intercourse was suspended between them, until her death, when they requested Mr. Carlton to let them take care of her infant daughter, which he angrily refused. Mr. Carlton knew human nature, and understood the worth of the Bradshaws. In fact, actuated by her Christian and neighbourly feelings, Mrs. Bradshaw attended the bed-side of his dying wife, and, at the earnest request of the father, and in obedience to the dictates of her own heart, took the infant to her home. The earliest recollections of Mary Carlton were of the Pilgrims' Purchase, and its kind inmates. They were, to her, father and mother, sister and brother. For years, she and Emily Bradshaw pressed the same pillow, and knelt by Mrs. Bradshaw's knee, night and morning, and repeated the same prayer. Clinton was their early playmate. To the country school, which lay through the woods, between Mr. Carlton's and the Purchase, they all went together, for years, when Clinton's health permitted his going; and when it did not, the girls would sport, in their play-time, round his couch, and do all they could to relieve his suffering. They would read to him, sing for him, gather for him the wild flower, and the best fruit;—and, in return, as he grew stronger, and his health became established, he did all he could to requite their kindness. Did they wish to take a ride, Clinton would get their horses, and see that all was right; did they wish to walk, Clinton was by their side. He would read to them the new book, or recite passages from the new poem. Did they wish any piece of finery from town, Clinton's pony was saddled; and to him often did they confide the choice and the colour. Though Clinton attended the college in the city, for years before he commenced the study of the law, yet he frequently spent weeks in the country; and, in the summer time, he would ride home almost every evening. The girls always looked for his coming, and felt disappointed and lonely if he came not. Latterly, since he had commenced the study of the law, his visits to the farm were much less frequent; and, for the last two or three years, Miss Carlton had taken up her residence at her father's estate, and spent there most of the time which was not occupied in town, by her various teachers. However, there was not a day passed, while she was in the country, that the girls did not meet; and any temporary absence only served to endear them the more to each other. Notes and letters passed constantly between them, when separated, in which every thing was told with the freedom and frankness of unreserved conversation. The neighbourhood of the Purchase was a very respectable one, and the intercourse social and friendly. The distinctions of society, known in the city, were not here recognised—or, if recognised, it was only in greater respect and kinder attentions. The whole neighbourhood worshipped at their county church. Religious meetings, too, were frequently held in the school-room in which many of the elders of the neighbourhood had conned their horn-books. At either of the places, when there was religious service, the inmates of the Purchase almost always attended, and were always expected by their neighbours, between whom and themselves the kindliest greetings, and the most friendly offices, passed. “Gentlemen,” said Bradshaw to Willoughby and Cavendish, one day, “the beautiful Indian summer is upon us. I feel as if I wanted to take a little holy-day. I've been pretty hard at it lately. Suppose, this afternoon, we go out to my father's; to-morrow will be Sunday; we'll visit the county church, and go round and see some of the old farmers: you'll be as welcome, Willoughby, as if you were in Kentuck. What say you?” They accepted the proposal; and it was agreed that they should start, towards evening, on horse-back. “Good morning,” said Bradshaw. “I'll walk down to the market, and tell old Pete we are coming.” “But where shall we meet this afternoon?” asked Willoughby. “Why, I'll meet you any place you appoint— or suppose you all meet me at Jackson's livery stable, at five.” “Agreed, agreed!” they exclaimed, as Bradshaw left them to see old Pete. “What kind of folks are the Bradshaws?” asked Willoughby. “I believe you have been often there, Judge, haven't you?” “Quit that judge-ing, if you please, Willoughby. Yes, often. They are first-rate people. The old gentleman is one of the finest looking men you ever saw; but he is as plain as a pike-staff, and a rigid methodist;—but, sir, you will see more dignity of manners in him than in the chief justice. He will welcome you like a prince; he possesses the real old-fashioned hospitality; he will throw his doors open to you, and you may just do as you list; he has family prayers regularly—he don't ask you to attend, but he is pleased if you do attend. Attend, if you wish to realize your conceptions of a Madonna, and see Clinton's sister at prayers. She is the most beautiful girl, in my opinion, in the state. I know it is said Mary Carlton has no rival, but I don't think so; to be sure she is transcendently beautiful—with the most brilliant eye and the richest lip I ever saw, and she looks as if she would dare all, where she loved; but I like the pale brow, the dark hair, and the winning gentleness of Emily Bradshaw much better. Kentuck, you don't seem to admire our beauty.” “Yes, I do,” replied Willoughby; “I admire beauty every where: but, as Burns says— `I look to the west, when I go to my rest.”' “If your heart stands unchanged the ordeal here, you'll be a `true lover,' as the chap says in the farce.” Willoughby laughed, and said—“I don't know how beautiful Bradshaw's sister is, but, I must say, the prettiest girl, decidedly, that I have seen east or west, is Miss Carlton. I don't know what kind of sentiments you can have, Cavendish, to object to a lady that `would dare all, where she loved.' I wouldn't have a girl who wouldn't dare all.” “And suppose you didn't act exactly to please such a dare-all lady?” asked Cavendish. “But, suppose I did! A woman has her rights as well as a man.” “A disciple of Mrs. Wolstoncraft,” exclaimed Cavendish. “Pooh,” said Willoughby, “if these are your real sentiments, you are laying up unhappiness for yourself beforehand. I wonder if Bradshaw has not some idea of Miss Carlton?” “I have thought so,” replied Cavendish. “She evidently prefers his company to any one's. It is hard work to read Bradshaw. It is evident he likes her: but I never could discover whether it was love. He has that gentle, attentive way, to every woman he knows. Bradshaw thinks more of his studies, and of overshadowing success, than of any thing else. His love would be as strong as his ambition; he would be a hard rival to get over; he would play `Allan A Dale' in fine style, if he could not succeed in any other way.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. According to arrangement, Bradshaw and his friends visited the Purchase that afternoon. They approached the farm as the sun was setting. That glorious luminary, surrounded by a gorgeous host of clouds, was hiding his disk behind a range of hills, which bound the Purchase on the west. The various hues of the foliage of the Indian summer, shone beautifully in the parting rays. Cantering gaily on, the young men felt that exhilaration of spirits, which a ride on horse-back seldom fails to impart, even to the aged. Bradshaw struck his spurs into his steed, as they bounded on, and glanced round on the scene with a compressed lip, but a flashing eye. Even the Judge's gravity relaxed;—though not a graceful horseman, he was a sure one, and he dashed on too, remarking, with something like a smile, “I like this.” As Willoughby gave the reins to his steed, he stretched his hand to the setting sun, and said: “There, Bradshaw! there's a scene: the sun's face looks like a jolly old toper, who has taken his last glass, and who is looking round, with a face full of joy, on the table. How beautiful the hill-tops look!—and the foliage! the foliage! What is there in the oriental lands superior to this of the west. The sun's glancing now upon old Kentuck, in her glory. He's laughing upon her hills, and dancing upon her streams. Those must have been glorious times in the early settlement of the west, when her free spirits were roving over hill and prairie, and when there was just danger enough from the savage foe to keep up excitement, and to make men proud of the life and strength which they felt their own prowess must maintain.” “Very glorious times,” said Cavendish, “with wild Indians behind the trees, lurking to shoot and scalp you. No! the pleasure that I now feel is in the perfect sense of security. I know there are no Indians here; my saddle girth is strong, and I can manage my horse; and there's health in the breeze. If we were now riding in the west, in early times, as an Irishman would say, I would not be with you. I'd rather be snug in a smoky office, poring over a law book.” “I know it, Judge,” replied Willoughby. “If you had been among the pioneers all around the region of the scalp lock, you would have gone gray for fear of losing it, while the lock itself would have been silvered o'er. But, when the country was cleared, you would have been first rate on the judgment-seat, with a log shanty for a court-house, where a lawyer would have to take his coat off, and go at it, like all wrath, to earn any thing of a fee; and where they would have to run down a jury, as they do now in Indiana—catch them, man by man, and tie them to a tree, till they've got a Vol. I. 9 dozen, and then bring them, tied together, to prevent their escape, into the court-house.” “In those early times,” said Bradshaw, “there must have been a great field for the display of eloquence. Men, who follow mainly their impulses, must be greatly moved by oratory. Henry Clay is a very great man, no doubt; but, then, he had a great field, Willoughby—he had a great field.” “Yes, that's a fact,” replied Willoughby. “I remember seeing, somewhere, a tale of Davies— Joe Davies, as he is called in Kentuck—he who was killed at the battle of Tippecanoe, where the gallant Harrison commanded, which illustrates the effect of eloquence upon a Kentuckian. The tale states that a stranger, from one of the eastern states, was travelling in a distant part of Kentucky: he was attracted, by a great crowd, to a log house, in which, when he entered, he found the court for the county sitting. A case, I believe, of seduction, occupied the attention of the court. Pleased with the powers of the defendant's counsel, the stranger stopped to listen. After the speaker concluded, a man in a hunting-dress arose and addressed the jury, for the plaintiff, in reply. He began awkwardly, but he warmed as he went along, handled the testimony in a most masterly manner, and concluded with an overwhelming burst of eloquence, that melted the audience to tears. The stranger was so struck with the speech, that, as the assembly broke up, he inquired of a rough-looking Kentuck, who the last lawyer was. The Kentuckian looked at him with surprise, observing—`You must be a stranger in these parts.' `I am,' said the stranger. `I thought so,' replied the Kentuckian, `for nobody but Joe Davies ever made me cry by the tin-full.”'[1] [1] This incident—whether fact or fiction, I know not—forms a very pretty story in Hall's Magazine, or the Cincinnati Gazette, I forget which. As they wound up the hill, the scene appeared more and more striking. The noble grove of oaks behind the house, with its rich variety of hues, looked even richer in the sun-set, while the venerable mansion, with its comfortable out-houses, and highly cultivated grounds, presented a picture of repose and peace that contrasted delightfully with the city scene which the young men had just left. As they approached the gate, old Pete's son, young Pete, was perched on the top of the gate-post, waiting for the cows to come up, instead of going after them, as he had been ordered. Young Pete had taken his present elevated situation for a double purpose—first, that he might keep a sharp look out towards the house, and learn, as soon as possible, if his mother, who attended to the duties of the dairy, should have any intention of stealing a march upon him, with purposes unfriendly to his quiet; and, secondly, that, while taking his ease, instead of running after the cows, he might command a view of them, as they strolled leisurely along, occasionally stopping to crop the herbage on the sides of the lane, and observe if any of them had a disposition to turn back, or to stop so long, as to render his activity imperious. Young Pete had on one of “Massa Clinton's” old jackets, which Clinton had worn when a boy, and which was too large for its present wearer. The pockets were crammed full of marbles, tops, and bits of twine, with which Pete set snares. His head was graced with an old hat, without any crown in it, and with the rim torn off in front, so that the vision of the wearer might not be intercepted. He had a round, shiny face; his mouth seemed made for a broad grin, as it was perpetually developing his ivory from ear to ear. With his lower extremities, which were graced with a thick pair of coarse shoes, he was drumming against the gate-post, on which he was seated, while he patted his thighs and whistled, in harmony. Occasionally, he would stop, as if struck with a sudden thought, count and recount his marbles, to see that none were missing, and then stow them away safely in his pockets; or he would examine his twine, to be satisfied that there were no weak places in it, that might let a rabbit off; or he would glance up at some bird that was taking roost in a tree near him, and then at a stone on the ground; but his love of ease, after a slight struggle, would prevail over his more warlike purposes. As soon as young Pete heard the tramp of the horses, and the voices of the horsemen, he got up on the post, to see who was coming. “By goley,” said he, jumping down from the post, and throwing the gate wide open, “there comes Massa Clinton, and that gentlemans what looks like a preacher, that Massa Clinton calls Judge; and another gentlemans. Pete, keep your eye open, nigger—you'll get something whiter than a red cent.” Holding the gate officiously open, he waited the approach of Massa Clinton and his friends. “Well, Pete,” asked Bradshaw, “how are all at home?” “Sarvant, Massa Clinton,” said young Pete, doing his best at a bow: “all's well, sir. Miss Mary's come out this morning.” “Ah, did she!—Hold your hat—the devil: you're like my Lord Bacon: you love the blessed rain of heaven upon your head.[2] [2] Lord Bacon, we are told, would uncover his head in riding out, even, sometimes, in the rain. Catch, then!” The shining metal, for a moment, glistened through the air, and the next it was safe between young Pete's palms. Pete eyed it, as the horsemen dashed on, and said, “I was jist guine to chuck you up and catch you, but fool who! if I miss you, you'll hide in the grass, like that fip the tother day. Gaul darn it, I can't find it, no how! I stood right in the spot, and chucked up a stone, but it wouldn't fall in the right place. Come in, cows! Come in! I'll buy a Jews-harp, some more marbles, some gingerbread, and have some red cents left. Massa Clinton's the best massa 'bout here, jist as he's the 'cutest. Pete, you're no fool for a nigger, neither.” Young Pete here observed his mother advancing, with a stealthy step, towards him, with her right hand ominously behind her.” “Oh, mammy!” exclaimed Pete, as soon as he could make his voice reach the maternal ear, “I've had a tarnal fuss with them cows. Massa Clinton and them gentlemans what come with him, dashed up an' scattered 'em every which way. He gin me some money, though, mammy, an' I'm guine, 9* soon as I git my supper, down to the road to buy you some 'bacca.” “That's right, Pete,” said his mother, dropping a stout switch behind her, as she spoke; “drive 'em quick round to the yard, and put up the bars. I want some 'bacca badly.” At the door of his hospitable mansion, Mr. Bradshaw welcomed the friends of his sons in a manner that justified the eulogy of Cavendish; by his side stood Emily Bradshaw and Mary Carlton. “Mary,” said Bradshaw, “this puts me in mind of old times.” “Come, sir, not such old times neither; we're not so ancient of days. If we are, my memory is vivid; for it seems to me as yesterday.” As Bradshaw entered the house by her side, he whispered, “May it always seem so, lady fair.” At the board of Mr. Bradshaw, under the care of his daughter, there was elegance as well as abundance. The evening glided on delightfully. Seated in the corner, in a comfortable rocking-chair, Mrs. Bradshaw employed herself in knitting, every moment glancing round with a delightful smile, and occasionally mingling in the conversation. Cavendish sat beside old Mr. Bradshaw, much interested in a conversation with him as to the probable decision of the court on a writ of mandamus, which had been granted in a religious controversy. Willoughby was engaged in conversation with Miss Bradshaw. At a stand, a little apart, sat Mary Carlton, with a pencil in her hand, making grotesque figures, and writing names on the blank leaf of a novel, while her long curls fell over either cheek and touched the book before her, leaving uncovered a neck white as snow. Bradshaw sat beside her, with his elbow on the stand, leaning his head on his hand: he mingled in the conversation whenever it became general, which was every few minutes, for a passing remark or two, when, again, every one would turn to his immediate neighbour, and Bradshaw would address Miss Carlton, or answer some remark of hers—she looking up at him from the paper momently, with a face expressive of every emotion, as it passed through her mind. Sometimes she would throw back her curls with a happy laugh; or bury her face in them, and seem to be busily drawing, as he spoke; or glance through them with so arch a look, that whoever chanced to catch it, though engaged at the time in earnest conversation with another, could not but smile pleasantly at its beauty and expression. At ten o'clock, the servants were called in to prayers: after reading a chapter in the Bible, Mr. Bradshaw offered up a prayer to the throne of grace, with that impressive fervour that comes right from the heart, and goes right to it. The girls, with most sweet voices, then sang a hymn;— and the old folks retired, and left the young ones to themselves. After Mr. and Mrs. Bradshaw retired, Willoughby sat, with folded arms, musing for some time. At last, he exclaimed, as if he were expressing his own thoughts, unconscious to whom he spoke— “Bradshaw, how I like the face of your father! He looks as if he had the blood of the pilgrims in him. I feel he would have stood on the pilgrim rock, with the ocean behind him, and wilderness before, with a firm reliance upon that Being to worship whom, in freedom, he had sought the spot. Where the deuce did you get your ambition from, and your tact, and worldly energies?” “From the world,” said Bradshaw, smiling, “if I have them. But,” continued he, gravely, “the lessons I have learned under this roof will ever, I hope, keep them in just subjection. Kentuck, I'm glad you like my father: I thought you would. I'm prouder of him than if he were a duke. You must know, that I consider, if there is any aristocracy in this free land, I belong to it. Not that I consider any “stagnant, wasting reservoir of merit” in my ancestors should do me any good, but only if such honours are to count in the game of life, I lay claim to my share.” “But you would rather count by tricks, would you?” said the Judge, who was very proud of being descended from one of the old families. “No, Judge, not exactly,” replied Bradshaw, smiling; “but I would have honours easy, a fair deal, honest players, and then go a-head for the odd trick, which should not be won by trickery.” “There's a knave in every pack, Bradshaw,” said Cavendish. “I know it, Judge; but, remember, he counts among the honours, and takes a trick, too, your honourable knave.” The next morning shone upon the inmates of the Purchase one of the mildest and mellowest of this delightful season. A thin haze rested over the landscape; the branch rippled along like a sheet of silver, over which the weeping willow hung still green, while the other trees bore the red and yellow leaf. It was determined that they should all go to the county church; Mr. and Mrs. Bradshaw, as usual, in their chaise, and the rest on horseback. A servant had been sent to Mr. Carlton's for Mary's favourite horse; and, at the proper hour, the party could be seen on their “winding way” through the woods. The church was situated about two miles from the Purchase, at a place called the cross roads, where a road that ran parallel with the turnpikes of which we have spoken, intersected another that connected them. These cross roads were made for the convenience of the different farmers who lived off of the turnpikes. There were no buildings at the cross roads but the church and a farm-house, the owner of which attended to the duty of having the church swept and lighted. This rural place of worship stood on a rising ground, in a high primeval forest that towered above and around, and formed, in summer, a delightful shade, beneath which the horses and various vehicles of conveyance of the worshippers might be seen whenever there was preaching. The church itself was built of such stone as was found in the neighbourhood, and very plain: it was erected on the ruins of a log meeting-house that had been built in the early settlement of the country, in which the rude forefathers, who were sleeping in the grave-yard near, had worshipped with their rifles in their hand, to guard their families around them, and their altar, from the cruelty and profanation of the savages. In the clearing which had been made to build the log meeting-house, was the grave-yard. A neat fence had been erected round it when the new church was built, immediately behind which it stood. Many of the head-pieces at the graves had sunk considerably in the earth, while various others leaned in different directions in the dark, rank grass. An aged oak, that had grown to an immense size, stood in the right corner, at the lower end of the enclosure; immediately at the foot of which was a grave, where, according to tradition, he, who had contributed most to the log meeting-house, and given the ground on which it stood, slept. In the opposite corner was a weeping willow that bent inwards towards the graves, and bowed its branches over them as though it felt the sorrow of which it was the emblem. Many willows, besides, and some cedars, with the wild sweet brier, and, here and there, a clump of alders, grew over the last repose of the sleepers. Every thing around, as a painter would say, was in keeping. The large gray stone that composed the church with the tiled roof, to which the overshadowing trees had given a mossy appearance, made the building seem much older than it really was. The Sabbath, in such a scene, was truly the Sabbath. A party would ride up and fasten their horses under the trees, and join some group of friends who had arrived before them, and who were waiting for the coming of the preacher, when the most neighbourly salutations would be given and received. Here, a rustic beau, bedecked in his best, would assist a rustic belle from her palfrey, and fasten him to some tree, on which, perchance, he had been carving her initials, in his best style, surrounding them with a double heart, in which sacred enclosure he hoped some day to carve his own: while, there, some old couple were descending from their ancient vehicle, assisted, may be, by the country doctor, who inquires, with a most sympathetic physiognomy, after the old lady's “rheumatise,” and narrates some cure which he had just effected in neighbour Tomkins' right leg, just at the knee-joint, that had been sorely afflicted since last winter. In the corners of the fences, and lolling against the trees, on the sunny side, might be seen the negroes, in various lazy groups, talking in a low voice. Some old aristocratic family black would, with officious zeal, hold his young “Massa's” horse, and boast of him as he walked away; while his wife or daughter would speak of their young “Missus,” and tell how many beaux she had. These old servants have as much family pride as their masters. On this occasion, young Pete was in the woods, within sight of the meeting-house, but in rather an unfrequented place, with a whole troop of little blacks around him, displaying his various treasures of marbles, gingerbread, twine, red cents, and fips, with the zeal of a connoisseur, who exhibits a diamond, whilst he pronounces it of the best water. By his officiousness in attending upon Willoughby and Cavendish—holding their stirrups, tightening their girths, &amp;c.,—he had contrived to levy a contribution upon both of them. Early in the morning, he slipped round to the grocery store, added to his stock of marbles, bought his mammy some 'bacca, himself a great hunck of gingerbread and a Jews-harp; and, with his change jingling in his pocket, came, whistling, to church. His jacket was buttoned, by one button, just above the pockets, so that their openings, or mouths, were drawn down tightly over their accumulated treasures, that projected luxuriantly on either side. A large, old-fashioned pin, that, by rights, belonged to Mrs. Bradshaw, flanked the button, and made assurance doubly sure. When he unpinned his jacket, he carefully deposited the pin in his cuff, and then, unbuttoning the garment, he exclaimed— “Now, niggers, keep your eyes open! Do you see this little child—this white alley?” said he, showing a white marble, after wetting it in his mouth; “look at the streaks in it. She's a little pealer—she cost two of the prettiest red cents you ever seed—she's my man! Who'll play, niggers? There's twine, that the rabbits 'll love to have round their necks. There's fips for you, niggers! five of 'em, and look at them red cents. Look at this Jews-harp! it ain't iron, it's silver; I can make her sing betterer than 'ary lady at that are church, but my two missusses. Here,” said he, taking out of his hat, the top of which he had tied with twine, so that it looked like a sugar-loaf, a large piece of gingerbread, “here, niggers, here's some gingerbread for you; this nigger's got his belly full. Wait till church is guine in, and we'll go down to the road, and I'll treat the whole on you to some cherry-bounce. Take care! take care! there's massa Clinton, and them gentlemans, and young missusses. I must tend their horses!” exclaimed young Pete, running towards the church. “Here, gaul darn it! Joe Carlton keep that marble for me,” said Pete, as a marble bounced out of his pocket. On he went, not having time to button his jacket, which, nevertheless, he held together with his elbows pressed down on his pockets. The young men gathered round Bradshaw and welcomed him. It was evident, that he was a great favourite, and that they were proud of his acquaintance. He had not the least show-off in his manner; on the contrary, he seemed almost boyish, as he grasped their hands, inquired after their parents, and spoke of their schoolboy pranks together. Even the oldest men seemed anxious to speak with him, and listened, when he spoke upon any subject, not as they generally listen to young men, with restiff impatience or indifference, but with affectionate respect. He knew all the country belles, from the blacksmith's daughter, a pretty girl, by the by, to Miss Carlton. His manner was the same to all. They greeted him joyously, asked why he had not been to see them, and told him he must be sure to ride over. All the negroes, young and old, knew him; and, as he passed them, they were sure to speak to him, and receive a kindly remark: so was it with his sister and Mary Carlton. With sober and quiet dignity, the congregation were soon all gathered into the church, like, to use the Scriptural phrase, the sheep in the fold. The sermon was a plain, practical one—upon good works, such as all denominations of Christians Vol. I. 10 might subscribe to, without offence to any of their sectarian notions of faith. After the service was over, a number of the young gentlemen and ladies of the neighbourhood rode over to the Purchase, and spent the remainder of the day there. Cavendish was known before in the neighbourhood, and popular. It was pleasing to observe how quickly Willoughby became a favourite. His frank manners, manly deportment, fine person, and general intelligence interested every one. He seemed so soon to catch the hue of the society around him. He gave pleasure not by attempting the arts of pleasing, but by giving himself up to the social impulses of his companions. “There was so much heart in his manners,” as Emily Bradshaw observed. He was a young man of fortune; or rather he had the expectation of a very large one, at the death of his only relative, an uncle. Willoughby was an orphan, and the only blood connexion that he had in the world was this uncle. In speaking once of his uncle to Bradshaw, Willoughby said: “My uncle, Bradshaw, is one of the strangest men you ever saw: he is generous, at times, to a fault—that is, when the wind blows right—and he'll chirp about like a bird: you'd think, to see him then, that he never had a sad moment—after a while, he falls upon what he calls one of his dark days, and then every thing goes wrong with him—he hates to part with a fip, gets tetchy, wayward, usurious, and fancies his best friend his foe. It proceeds from ill health—a disorder of the liver, which the doctor told me once, in confidence, for he dare not tell the old gentleman, he thought partially affected his mind. He has no children—never was married—and he received, by inheritance, a large estate, to which he has all his life been adding. He has now the largest fortune in the west. He has treated me with wayward harshness several times, but he always made more than an atonement. Generally, he gives me every thing that I want—and, I really believe, is sometimes angry with me because I don't spend more money; but he is a strangely suspicious being.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. As the fall advanced, the younger members of the bar, the students and others, at the suggestion of Bradshaw, formed a debating society. They met night after night, preparing a constitution and adding to their numbers. Bradshaw exerted himself to get up the institution and to infuse an esprit du corps into the society. He would dwell, among his companions, with no common enthusiasm, on those accounts in the lives of eminent men, which tell of their first efforts in debating societies. “Practice is the thing,” he would say, “and we must go a-head; `keep moving, dad, keep moving,' as young Rapid says in the play. We must keep moving with a high purpose. Without going back to the ancients—to the cave of Demosthenes, and his shaven crown, and six months' self-imprisonment—to Cicero's trials and studies, and a hundred others; look at the moderns! Poor Curran, by Jove! we are told, that his wife and family occupied the room in which the debating society to which he belonged met—they let him occupy it because he had no other—and he had to move out bag and baggage, wife and children, every Saturday night that they might meet. When old Bob Lyons took him his first fee, Curran said himself that the only furniture of his room was a bed, table, a few broken chairs, a pregnant wife, and three children. What a beautiful passage that is in his speeches, where, addressing Lord Avonmore, between whom and himself there had been a misunderstanding, he reminded him of their early associations; Avonmore burst into tears. Avonmore was, in those days which Curran referred to, not worth a sixpence himself. When Curran was at college, the faculty were about censuring him for his slovenliness; in self-defence, he told the anecdote of Avonmore. `Mother,' said Avonmore, `I wish I had eleven shirts!'—`Why so, Barry?'—`Because, mother, I think, a man, to be a gentleman, should have the full dozen.” Do ye take? Curran had but one— a first-rate excuse for not changing. Erskine went to the Robin Hood debating society night after night; by practising there, he acquired that command of his powers, which enabled him, in his very first speech at the bar, to come out all excellence. Burke first signalized himself at a debating society, by opposing a journeyman baker, who, Goldsmith said, was fit to be lord chancellor. Look at our own great men! Judge Chase, the signer of the Declaration of Independence, happened to go into a debating society in Annapolis, and there heard William Pinckney, who was but an apothecary's boy. `I do remember an apothecary,' realizing Shakspeare's description, no doubt. Chase was so struck with his talents that he advised him on the spot to study law; and, as Pinckney had no means, Chase took him into his own house. Henry Clay 10* made his first effort in a debating society, in Lexington, Kentucky, I believe—your hailing place, Willoughby. When Clay rose to speak, instead of addressing the president of the society, he said `Gentlemen of the jury.' This shows that Clay often thought of making a speech before he did make one; and if he had not often thought of it, he would not only have been embarrassed at first, but, in all probability, he would have failed completely. I tell you what it is, most of us must get our bread by the wagging of our tongues, and I am for commencing the practice early. Washington Irving, in speaking of a woman's tongue—and we may say it of a man's—says it is the only edged tool that grows sharper from constant use. Ay, Judge, I see you smile! You think children should not play with edged tools. I know it; but remember, we are apprentices to a trade that requires the use of these edged tools, and if we would not cut our fingers with them when old, we must use them when young. `Words are things;' and in our profession, it is scarcely saying too much, to assert that they are every thing.” The debating society was formed, and gradually increased until it numbered upwards of a hundred. The society held its meetings in a very large hall, over an engine house—“an appropriate place for spouting,” as Bradshaw was wont to remark— where they had crowded audiences every public evening. On every other evening, only, were the public admitted, because there were many members who wished to break the ice, but who shrunk from doing it before a large audience, which might embarrass them so much as to prevent their proceeding; an event that is not so likely to occur before a smaller audience, composed only of members of the society, with whom the speaker is personally acquainted; and, if it did occur, the mortification would not be so great. Besides, it would not redound to the credit of the society, to have its members fail in a public attempt; and it is one of the most disagreeable things in the world, to a sensitive mind, to witness it. When the society was first got up, some of the students of the law were for having it exclusive. But Bradshaw laughed at the idea. “If you can convince us, gentlemen,” said he, “that intellect is confined exclusively to our profession, agreed, and we will have our debating society a theatre for displaying it, and we will all be stars. But “Genius is of no country; her pure ray Spreads all abroad, as general as the day.” There is both rhyme and reason in those two pithy lines of Churchill, the satirist. Your notion would be a good subject for his muse, if she would stoop to it from her supreme dominion. Ay, and genius is of no profession, either. By Jove, I know a young blacksmith, round the corner, to whom some of us will not be able to hold a candle. No, sirs, I am for having every young man join, who is respectable, be he who he may, or what he may. Let us have our society upon republican principles. Let the majority elect the officers and decide the questions; and, as a matter of courtesy, on public evenings, we must invite our audience to vote upon the merits of the debate. Let our constitution and by-laws be as simple as can be, so that we may have no disputes about them: for what is more tedious than such disputes? Notwithstanding the republican principles I have just avowed, I was going to propose that we should put every fellow in Coventry, who makes a long speech upon constitutions and by-laws.” Bradshaw spared no pains to improve himself in speaking and composition. Though he had not half the reputation for studious habits that many of his fellow-students had, yet he thought much more than any of them. He was not so often seen with a book or pen in his hand, and he was often caught in his little room, over the office of the gentleman with whom he read law, with his arms folded, in a state of abstraction, or stretched out, apparently listless, on three or four chairs, or walking up and down his room, talking to himself; but, generally, in all these moods, he was unravelling some intricate question, or repeating the thoughts of some author in his own language, that he might the more impress them on his mind; or he was preparing himself for some discussion before his society, and making over and over to himself a train of argument, which, though he put not one word of it on paper, he, nevertheless, had as pat, as much by heart, as if he had committed it all to paper, and then to memory. This is, perhaps, the best way to study; for then the student carries about with him ever his intellectual gifts. When he writes a speech and commits it to memory, in the act of writing he only seeks to put his thought down, and in speaking, to pick it up. In this habit, he is apt to lose or injure his powers of extemporizing—for the mind is as much influenced by habit as the body; and having accustomed himself to speak prepared language, no matter how well he may be acquainted with his subject, he cannot speak without that preparation—consequently, his mental exercise, when speaking, is but an act of memory, from which the excitement that arises in the creation of an argument, or even in expressing it, in extemporaneous language, is banished. This makes a speaker a mere actor; and, though he expresses his own thoughts, his mind is a reservoir, and not a fountain—it has none of the gush and glow, the sparkling vivacity, and the crystal clearness, of the spring. Found, as often as we have said Bradshaw was, without pen or book, it gave him a reputation rather for idleness than industry, among those who did not know him well; a reputation which, with a Sheridan-like vanity, he was at no pains to contradict; when the fact was, that in mental industry, as we have already observed, he equalled any of his compeers. From such habits of study as Bradshaw's, many men have obtained a reputation for idleness. Patrick Henry, for instance; who can doubt, that when watching for hours his fishing-cork without even a nibble, or when roaming days through the woods, that he was forming those bright creations which astonished his contemporaries. When Sheridan's friends thought him asleep in bed, he was in bed, it is true, but was preparing his speech for the evening in the house. Curran's favourite habit of study was with a violin in his hand, running over some of his favourite tunes: those who saw him indulging his musical taste, just before making his great efforts, thought, doubtless, he was very idle, and that his speeches were all miraculous creations. So they were miraculous creations, but, as Moore said of Sheridan, “like a skilful priest, he prepared the miracle of the moment beforehand.” Much has been said of the extemporaneous reply of Mr. Webster to Mr. Hayne, in the Senate of the United States, on Foote's resolutions,—so it might have been extemporaneous as to language, but the great constitutional argument which that speech contains, has been the elaboration of Mr. Webster's political life. Bradshaw had every natural advantage to make an orator:—a fine person, most graceful manners, one of the most expressive faces in the world, capable of every variety of expression, and a voice loud and clear in its high tones, while its lowest were silvery, and as distinct as Kean's the tragedian, and an eye like an eagle's. At the table of Mr. Glassman, who was very fond of theatricals, and who esteemed acting, in some respects, the sister-art to oratory, he frequently met the distinguished actor, B—. Once after dinner, Glassman and B—, recited different passages from Shakspeare, and they called on Bradshaw to do the same. With some diffidence he complied. They were much struck with his powers, and the tragedian used all his eloquence to induce him to join the stage. “Why not,” said he, “you will make much more money than you possibly can at the bar, and then the applause of the theatre is as gratifying as that of the bar.” Bradshaw did not state his reasons for not complying with the advice of the tragedian: he, however, pleased the actor so much, that they became very intimate. Bradshaw took lessons in oratory from him, and he derived from his instructions great practical advantages. “That's it, that's it,” the tragedian would exclaim, after Bradshaw had recited for him some of the best passages of the drama, “O, what an Ovid was in Murray lost!” So said Pope of his friend Mansfield, and so may I, with a little change of the line, say of you, “O, what an actor was in” Bradshaw “lost!” “Be careful—you waste your voice too much: that is, you too often make it exert its utmost powers; if you were to perform a tragedy—Richard the Third, for instance, or Lear—you would be exhausted before you got into the fifth act, for which you should husband your energies. In speaking a speech, you will, perhaps, be more liable to exhaustion, because you must go on without a breathing spell. It is execrable to hear a man speak after his energies are exhausted. Pray you, avoid it, as Hamlet would say. By the by, that speech of Hamlet to the players, is the best advice in the world to your profession as well as to mine. If I were you, as a speaker, I never would study a gesture for a particular passage: it is proper in our profession, but I doubt if it would suit in yours. On the stage, whether our feelings are in cue or not, we must go through the part as it is set down, and, of course, when we come to the affecting passage, we must use the appropriate gesture. In this respect the orator has the advantage of the actor. You are not compelled to be pathetic, whether your feelings will or not: But we, though not in the `melting mood,' must assume the feeling, though we have it not, when we reach that passage in Othello, where the melting mood is necessary. You will be careful never to attempt the pathetic, the awful, the sublime, or even the ridiculous, but where you feel it. There is such a sympathy between heart and heart, that the commonest man in your audience will find you out if you do. Remember this, that when you have waked a feeling—an impulse—no matter of what passion, you can easier pass to another—its very opposite—than you can call up a feeling from the dead level. You understand me: I mean that when your audience are excited, you can easier make them both laugh and weep, than you could make them laugh, if they were not excited. I told you not to prepare a gesture for a particular passage—you should not. If there is any imperfection in your gesture—if you are too hurried, for instance—correct it—correct all such imperfections, until your gestures impulsively assume a naturalness: Naturalness! sacrifice any thing, every thing to nature. I would rather see a speaker awkward and ungainly, where he felt, than ever so graceful and appropriate where he did not feel. Canning, for instance, had thrice the grace of Brougham, but Brougham produced much greater effect—was more powerful—that is, in plain language, he felt deeper what he said. Some one has said, I forget who, that a gesture should be `felt, not seen.' That is a just remark. Oratory is like Pope's description of beauty. It is not the eye or the brow that we call beauty; and it is not the tone, the look, the intellect, the gesture—Demosthenes to the contrary, notwithstanding—that we call oratory, `But the full force and joint effect of all.”' Bradshaw applied himself closely to his legal studies, but not so closely as to neglect polite literature or general information. On the contrary, he made himself familiar with all the great English poets and prose writers: in the interval of his law studies, he resorted to them as recreation. He accustomed himself to composition, and occasionally wrote for the press, not only prose, but sometimes he attempted poetry, for which he had a taste. Often, after a long deliberation on the subject to be discussed at his debating society, he would write out an argument, pro and con, on the question, and then go to his society; and without taking with him a note, or repeating a line of what he had written, he would enter into the debate. In this way, not only by the force of his great natural talents, but by his industry, he surpassed every member of the society, although there was a great deal of talent in it, and men much older than himself. There were some who detracted from him, it is true; for when was there Vol. I. 11 high talent that had not detractors? but this was only with a few members of the society who envied him: with the great majority, and with the visiters, he stood without a rival. Cavendish would often press hard upon him, not in oratory or general information, nor in powers of language, but in close argument, and in dry, quaint humour. Willoughby, in wild declamation, keen remarks, and odd phraseology, would sometimes produce a strong impression; and Jekyl, the blacksmith, of whom Bradshaw spoke—though his pronunciation was bad, his sentences ungrammatical, and his manner awkward; and though he possessed comparatively very little information, yet by the dint of powerful native talent, to borrow an illustration from his own craft, he would weld his arguments together with such sledge-hammer force and directness, that it often required all Bradshaw's eloquence, with appropriate quotation, varied knowledge, and great powers of argumentation, to remove the impression. Jekyl possessed a remarkably pure heart and mind,—he had no envy in his composition. Bradshaw had broken his father's chase, and drove round to the blacksmith-shop, at which Jekyl worked as a journeyman, to have it mended. While he was mending it, Bradshaw entered into conversation with him, and was pleased. Afterwards, in his walks, he would often stop in and converse with Jekyl while at work. In this way an intimacy grew up between them; and often, after his day's work, Jekyl might be seen walking round to the room of Bradshaw, where they would sit and converse for hours. Bradshaw proposed Jekyl as a member of their debating society; and in spite of the opposition of some of the members, whose aristocracy was offended, he had him elected. Jekyl had no wit or humour, nor powers of retort, and was, withal, very sensitive. Some of the members—and particularly one named Talbot, who possessed considerable talent, and more malignity—would frequently ridicule his bad pronunciation and grammatical errors. The blacksmith would suffer in silence; for, as we have observed, he had no talent for reply. On such occasions, Bradshaw always came to the rescue of his friend: his indignant eye and withering sarcasm, had silenced such remarks for some time, when, on one occasion, Talbot, who had been beaten in the debate by Jekyl, in reply, was guilty not only of ridiculing his grammatical errors and bad pronunciation, but of the mean personality of alluding to his occupation. Bradshaw rose indignantly—it was a public debate—and said, “Mr. President, is it necessary for me here to repeat the well known anecdote of a celebrated character, who had originally been a shoemaker, but who rose by the dint of great talents, and in spite of many obstacles, to distinction and power, and who was reproached with his former vocation by a certain person. `Sir,' said he, in reply, `by my industry, and with what gifts God gave me, I have arisen to be what I am: if the gentleman who taunts me with what I was, had been bred a shoemaker, he would have been a shoemaker still.' Sir, I will say this for my friend, the blacksmith, that if some ten or twenty years hence, the gentleman who has been so courteous in this debate, should then throw the smithy in his teeth, he may relate the anecdote which I have alluded to, with perfect applicability to that gentleman and to himself.” Bradshaw uttered this in a feeling and dignified manner; the whole audience, many of whom were mechanics, responded to it heartily, with a burst of applause: no uncommon tribute for Bradshaw to receive, but which was peculiarly grateful to the feelings of Jekyl, and humiliating to Talbot; for they both felt that the sentiment was applauded, as well as the utterer. Talbot never forgave Bradshaw; for among the audience were some of the most fashionable belles and beaux of the city, his acquaintance, who were in the habit of attending the public meetings of the society, which was, in fact, a place of fashionable resort. On Jekyl it produced as deep an impression, but of a far different kind. He was a lover, a painfully sensitive one; and he had brought with him to the debate, on this evening, the young girl whom he was wooing, who accompanied his mother and himself. He was deeply attached, and tremblingly alive to the issue of his attachment; for the maiden had not yet been won. Bradshaw's manly and high, yet courteous bearing, and the promise of a splendid career, which his efforts at the debating society had augured for him, already made him the town talk. This simple incident was, therefore, remembered by Jekyl with abundant gratitude. As the assembly broke up, he grasped Bradshaw convulsively by the hand; but his emotion would not let him say one word. Bradshaw caught the beaming eye of the maiden full upon him. With a quick sagacity he saw how matters stood—he saw, too, that Jekyl observed her happy expression, and as he shook the blacksmith's hand, he whispered to him significantly, “Go a-head, my dear fellow; `Faint heart never won fair lady.' Remember, this is both literally and metaphorically true.” That night Jekyl took heart, told his love, and was accepted. If he had sunk beneath the taunt of Talbot, and it had passed unanswered, would he have been accepted? Upon such slight things depend our weal or wo. Suspecting Jekyl's love affair, put Bradshaw in mind of Selman's; and, as he left the debating society, with Cavendish and Willoughby, and took an arm of each, on their way to Fleming's, he observed— “As Selman never takes part in our debates, and as Miss Penelope frequently attends, we must be true to our conspiracy of helping him on, and make him president of the society. What say you?” “Ha! ha!—good!” said Kentuck. “I thought this evening, as Miss Penelope has such admiration for oratory, that if Selman does not come out, he might hurt his suit. It's a first rate idea to make him president, for then he will not be expected to speak; and, as he can't, it is just the thing.” Not long after this debate, one was held on the question,—Whether woman was equal to man in intellect? Bradshaw maintained the superiority of man's, though he thought they were of a different order: that man's was like his frame, strong, 11* towering, muscular,—and that woman's was like hers, delicate, yielding, graceful; that she expressed best the thoughts that develope and cultivate the affections, and tell of their gentle sympathies and fond, dream-like hopes—that she best controlled the youthful mind, and taught it, at her knee, those duties which mould the after being, and make it what God intended;—that he expressed best the dark and daring, and ambitious emotions, those of power, of mastering passion in a wayward nature—that he was meant to govern his kind, as he had governed in all ages of the world. He concluded by saying, woman had the best heart and man the best head. Many of the sex attended the debate, and Talbot was the zealous advocate not only of their equality, but, in his zeal, and inspired by their presence, he proclaimed them superior to man, and pronounced a high-wrought eulogium on them to that effect. While he was speaking, Bradshaw wrote the following epigram on him, and handed it to Cavendish, who was mischievous enough, when Talbot took his seat, to read it aloud. It caused a great laugh at Talbot's expense, and rankled in his spirit. EPIGRAM. Talbot, proclaimer of great Nature's plan, Announces woman, master of the man; And says she came not as lone Adam's mate, But, coming after, came to legislate. Methinks I see him, in his proper station, Tied to her apron strings of legislation; Minding, with henpecked humbleness of mien, The scolded dictates of the thundering queen— Giving to her his breeches and his vote, And decked as woman, in her petticoat. To save him from his lady's dread undoing, Poor Jerry Sneak called loud on brother Bruin; But Talbot, like the Grecian, loves to yield;— When stern Zantippe, reigning, took the field, And from the upraised window hurled the shower— The sage looked up with blessings on her power. That woman is your equal, who can doubt? Sure, modest merit soon would find that out! Alas! in your philanthropy of mind, You make yourself a standard for mankind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. Through the winter, Bradshaw studied hard, prepared himself diligently for the debates at his society, and seldom listened to the voice of pleasure. Miss Carlton remained in town during her father's absence at Washington, where he was attending to his congressional duties, or rather writing home letters, franking papers and packages, and endeavouring to find out not what was the best measure, but what would take best; in short, attending to the personal considerations of a re-election. His daughter improved beyond all rivalry in every mental and fashionable quality; and, as she ripened into womanhood, her loveliness became more and more attractive and dazzling. Mary had not yet “come out;” that is, set up formally to visit and be visited. Nevertheless, many were the students of law, young merchants, and young men of fashion and fortune, about town, who called to see her, and took every occasion to join her in her way to and from school. Among the latter named gentlemen, who employed their time in cultivating their whiskers and propping up the posts at the corners of the streets, was Mr. Bates, who might frequently be seen lounging near the corner, by which she passed in her way to school, waiting to escort her there. Her way was through the court-house square, where she would frequently meet Bradshaw, as he passed to and from his boarding-house. Bradshaw would hurry along with his cloak thrown carelessly over his shoulder, often, in the coldest day, without it; and though he would, apparently, be thinking of any thing but the scene around him, as, in fact, he generally was; yet he saw what was passing, as might be known by his instant recognition of any one whom he knew, however slightly. An observer would have been struck with him, even in passing—the quick, momentary, penetrating glance he threw on every passer-by—his frank and free salute to every friend—the respectful bow to age, the graceful touch of the hat to every casual acquaintance—and the urbanity and perfect ease with which he would lift it to a lady, showed the ease of practised courtesy, and the self-sustainment of self-respect. Whenever Miss Carlton met Bradshaw, they always had something to say to each other, much to the annoyance of Mr. Bates. She would say, “Remember, Clinton, you go to the ball with me to-night;” or, “I have a letter from your sister, and if you want to read it, you must call and see me;” or, “I am going with the Hollidays to the theatre to-night, and I expect you for a beau: as you know Mr. B— so well, I like to hear you criticise his acting,” &amp;c. In a fit of jealousy against Bates, who was very attentive to Miss Perry, as well as to Miss Carlton, Selman had told Bradshaw of the conversation concerning him, which he overheard between Bates and Turnbull, at Mr. Perry's party. The morning after Selman told him, Bradshaw met Miss Carlton, as usual, with Mr. Bates by her side. “Good morning, Miss Carlton,” said he, “you and I used to be schoolmates, you remember, and we still go to school, though not together; I to the law, and you to the Miss Copelay. Pray, how long has Miss Bates been your school-mate?” This came so unexpectedly on Miss Carlton, and was said in such a manner, that she could not refrain from laughing; and as she did not like her present school-mate, she quickly replied, “About a month, sir.” All this was overheard by a number of young men, who were stationed at the corner—acquaintances of Mr. Bates. He was a very effeminate fellow, and they bored him nearly to death with it. It effectually stopped his gallantries to Miss Carlton. Time rolled on. In the mean while, Bradshaw had delivered several addresses before different literary societies of the city, written a series of numbers on politics for the press, which were extensively noticed, and made many political speeches at the town and ward meetings of the people: he was becoming a great favourite with all classes. Bradshaw was not yet admitted to the bar, but he would often muse and speculate, sometimes with a melancholy, sometimes humorous emotion on the feelings and characters of his friends and acquaintances, who were admitted and waiting for business, or who were on the eve of being admitted. Every young lawyer, and particularly the idle one, remembers his admittance to the bar, and his first efforts. How vividly he recollects the alternations of hope and fear, as he contemplated the near and nearer approach of the day when he is to stand before the committee appointed to examine him. At one moment he determines to put a bold face on the matter, and dash right a-head. At another, the “ghost of his departed hours” rise up before him, and frighten him from all propriety and all law. Sometimes, like the ghost of Banquo, it will not down, and desperately he determines to quit the law altogether. He thinks, over all the law he has read, and deuce take it! he cannot remember a first principle. “Certainly, certainly,” says he, “my law, like Bob Acre's courage, oozed from the end of my fingers, when I wrote that note, requesting to be examined. I'd better quit the law altogether,” thinks he, “for a moment—my constitution can't stand it.” `What! quit it,' says Pride, `just on the eve of an examination? what will the world say,' and if Pride should be reconciled to what the world would say, up starts Poverty with a peremptory, `You can't, sir.' Poverty is an absolute tyrant, even in a republic, and must be obeyed. Then the poor student will catch up first, one law book, and then another, hastily glance over the first case that presents itself, finds he knows nothing about it—looks at another—don't know it. Well, I'll read it through, I may be asked this very case. He reads it for awhile—closes the book—glances his eye upward, as if to scan futurity—then into the fire, as though a cloud had passed over the ceiling, and obscured his vision—jumps up—buttons his coat tight over his heart, like one about to brave an eminent peril—adjusts his neck-cloth, and walks hastily out to meet his fellow students, and talk over the characters of each and every member of the committee of examination. O, ye gray beards of the profession! if ye have sins, they are then assuredly remembered. If ye have the virtues of charity and good humour, your want of legal knowledge is called any thing but a fault; and the fact, that you have never rejected a student, is remembered while your consistency of character is eulogized. The important hour arrives, another, and the “long agony is over.” The next day, a pithy advertisement announces that — —, Attorney and Counsellor at Law, offers his professional services to the public; and it tells where his office is to be found. That said office is designated by a well painted piece of tin, which tells the twice-told tale to the indifferent public, ATTORNEY AND COUNSELLOR AT LAW. My gentleman thinks, at first, that he has the world in a sling. He sits, installed in his professional chair, like the man in the `Arabian Nights,' with his glass were before him, which it has taken his last cent to purchase, and which he thinks he will sell at great profit, and accumulate great wealth; and how he will have a sultana at his feet, whom he will indignantly spurn: he suits the action to the word, and, lo! the glass ware flies into a thousand fragments. Thus, too often dreams the young lawyer, and thus to fragments fly his hopes: they die, though, as our friends die, with a treacherous promise of returning health to-day, yet passing away, to-morrow, to the clod and to the worm, followed by others, and by others, till he stands—alone! At last, he volunteers—all great men have volunteered: Curran, Erskine, Pinckney, Webster, Wirt, Clay—and he determines to volunteer, too. Now comes on a second trial, as nerve-rending as the first: to manage the case, to examine and cross-examine the witness, to argue before the court the point of law, and to address the jury. That which he had looked to as the summum bonum of all his youthful aspirations, is within his grasp; but it is not as it seemed. He may fail! But, then, who ever succeeded in his first effort? Curran completely failed. Erskine said he never could have got on if he had not felt his wife and children pulling at his gown for bread; (I wish I had a wife and children, for a moment thinks the new attorney, and counsellor at law.) Sheridan failed, and —and—but, no matter,—I'll—I'll—astonish the natives yet. In the mean time, as the copy-plate says, “I'll do my best, and leave the rest.” Bradshaw, in contemplating his admittance to the bar, was not much disturbed by the feeling above described, but he had the very temperament to be thus disturbed, if he had spent his time in idleness. He was singularly constituted: to a sensitive and imaginative mind, he added great energy and action, a subtle knowledge of men, and a just perception of facts. He understood the relative situations of men and things, without suffering his Vol. I. 12 imagination to throw one of its rainbow tints across the clear vision of his judgment. In him, genius and common sense were combined. Whenever he mingled in the world, in whatever scene he might be, he was always studying character; and while he had the sagacity to understand it, he had an acute sensibility, which appreciated and sympathized with the emotions of every one, no matter how dissimilar to his own. Though subject, constitutionally, to great depression of spirits, by keeping his energies always alive and active, he generally dispelled them; and when gloomy views of the world, and of himself, crossed him, he went forth and mingled with the crowd, determined to brace himself for every encounter. Being thrown, by his early sickness, upon his own mental resources for amusement, he had endeavoured to acquire the philosopher's great precept, “Know thyself.” He felt that he must keep over himself— over his passions—a strong guard; he felt this the more, as he knew the watchman had sometimes slept, or yielded to the allurements of the rioters whom he should have quelled. As we have observed, Bradshaw had a very extensive acquaintance, which was not confined to the higher circles of society. At the political meetings, he had become acquainted with men of every class; with the keepers of the lowest groceries and taverns, as well as with the highest, and he knew their highest and lowest customers. In the large city in which he lived, there was a criminal court, exclusively for the city, in which offences of all kinds were tried, and where there were, of course, many criminals. In an election for mayor of the city, a young man whom Bradshaw knew, had committed an assault and battery, for which he had been indicted. He came to Bradshaw, and was very anxious that he would defend him. “I somehow feel,” said the young man, “that you will do me better justice than any body else— and all my acquaintances advised me to come to you.” “Garson, I would defend you with the greatest pleasure,” said Bradshaw, “but I have not yet been admitted to the bar.” “I wish to mercy you would be admitted, Mr. Bradshaw, and defend me. They accuse me of stabbing, which I never did. It will be a serious business with me: my wife is troubled most to death. What shall I pay you, sir?” “You're a good client,” said Bradshaw, smiling; “but wait till I have defended you. Call round this afternoon, at three o'clock, and I'll tell you whether I can or not. If I cannot, I will recommend you to a good lawyer.” Garson had scarcely left, when Cavendish entered the room. “Well, Cavendish,” said Bradshaw, (Cavendish had been admitted some time,) “how comes on the practice?” “Toll, loll,” said Cavendish: “with hard scratching, I shall manage to live and let live.” “I believe,” said Bradshaw, “that I shall be admitted, not to the civil court, but to the city criminal court. I mean to attend the lectures, particularly those on practice, again. The criminal law is simple, and, I flatter myself, I understand it as well as some of the gentlemen who practise it— though I may not have as great pretensions as they have to being a criminal lawyer. However, Garson, a young drayman, who thrashed a fellow who interrupted me at a political meeting, one night, has been indicted for stabbing a man. He wants me to defend him, and I think, under the circumstances, I ought to appear for him.” “I think so, too,” said Cavendish. “All you have to do, is to pass over to the court house—the criminal court is now sitting—and get some one to suggest to the court that you wish to be admitted. Old Price has the greatest kind of notion of you, and he will appoint a committee on the spot. The old fellow says that the court over which he presides is of as much more importance above the civil court, of as much more importance (here Cavendish imitated the judge's peculiar manner) as are men's lives and liberty of more importance to them than their property.” Bradshaw entered the court, and had the application made. The court, on the instant, appointed Mr. Shaffer to examine him. Mr. Shaffer was a formal, yet, where he took a liking, a frank old gentleman, with a great deal of eccentricity. He possessed great tact and eloquence in defending criminals. He was a gentleman of the old school of the bar, a kind of legal antiquary, who retained all the old habits. He still cultivated a queue and powdered his hair; and, though very old, retained his intellect, as might be seen in his quick twinkling gray eye. “I feel, your honour, that, in fulfilling this duty, I shall lessen my own fees—but it gives me pleasure, Mr. Bradshaw. Shall I now attend you, sir?” Bradshaw left the court with Mr. Shaffer. As they were leaving it, the old gentleman cut his eye at him, and asked, “Mr. Bradshaw, can you make a glass of whisky-punch?” “Yes, sir,” said Bradshaw, “and drink one, too, if you will do me the honour of drinking with me.” “Ah!” exclaimed the old gentleman, “then you are qualified—I will make out your certificate— quite qualified to be a lawyer, according to the present method of making them.” “Suppose we walk into the oyster house, that I may prove my qualifications; and you will then, if you please, sir, give me the certificate.” They entered the oyster house, or, to give the establishment the title with which its owner designated it, the Court-House Restaurateur, where Bradshaw proved to Mr. Shaffer that he was doubly qualified for admittance, and where the veteran showed that he was amply qualified to judge of such qualifications. “Mr. Bradshaw,” remarked Mr. Shaffer, gladdening over the memory of other days, while he revived it, “the times at this bar are not as they used to be, sir; I never felt myself, sir, I never felt myself since they tore down the old court-house, and built this. To be sure, sir, the old one was an old affair, it had none of the tinsel and bedizzened finery of this, with your damask drapery over the judgment-seat, where the image of 12* the goddess sits as her prototype swings over a tavern door, and she hears just about as much wrangling and brawling. This is a splendid affair —a splendid affair our new court-house. You don't remember the old one—give me the splendid eloquence—that's the kind of splendour for a court room; and the old halls echoed it in my young day. `When I was young, ah, woful when!' as some one sings. Scott's character of Pleydel, in his Guy Mannering—I heard you speaking of it in conversation the other day with the Judge— is just the fac simile of our lawyers—I mean of what our lawyers used to be, sir. In those days, sir, the profession lived like men; yes, sir, like gentlemen: they took their ease, sir, and they attended to their business with a free and easy spirit. They loved their wine, sir, and they enjoyed it. Why, Mr. Bradshaw, now-a-days, sir, you must perceive it yourself—now-a-days the souls of our lawyers are wrapped up in speculations and per centage: they have money to lend, sir, at fifty per cent. interest—and they care no more for the dignity of the profession than if there was not such a thing. No, sir, the spirit of chivalry in our bar departed with the old court-house; and, as we lawyers would say, sir, there was no animi revertendi. Often, sir, often do I call up those days; but they are becoming a bitter memory. I stood upon the spot, the other day, where the old court-house stood, and, like he who came to the place of his birth, and asked for the friends of his youth, Where are they? and echo answered and said, Where are they? Thus I asked, Where are the noble spirits of by-gone days—the true models of what the profession should be? Echo's was the only answer; and I felt a sense of desolation heavy on me—signs of dotage, I suppose the present generation would tell me. It may be, sir; it may be. I am an old bachelor, with no kin nor kind, except an infirm brother, much older than myself. I am the last of my race, as a man and a lawyer—`Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.”' “You mistake the feeling, indeed, sir,” said Bradshaw, touched with the old gentleman's evident emotion. “The oak, that by its vital strength has outlived its companions, braving many winters, and spreading its leafy honours in many a summer, is the noblest oak of them all. We seek its patriarchal shade with reverence; and the wild vine by, that would have crept, but for its support, clings to it and towers.” “Mr. Bradshaw,” said Shaffer, his eye glistening, “I appreciate your sympathy with an old man's regrets—that feeling which honours age, sir, is a blessed one; no matter in whose person it is honoured. I might read you a long lecture upon our profession; but, sir, another time. Remember, you must not forget to give old Nancy a dollar or two on your admittance; she claims it, sir, from all, and has, for these fifteen or twenty years past, from every lawyer who is admitted. I know but one man who ever refused; and that was that fipenny-bit fellow, Scrags—a sample of your modern lawyers, Mr. Bradshaw. She berated Scrags so roundly for it, at every place she met him, and treated him with such contempt and derision, that I believe the fellow, gingerly dog as he is, would give one hundred dollars to escape the odium. Nancy has great popularity in the class from which he gets many of his clients; and she has lost him many a one by laughing, in her rough way, at his pretensions, and telling tales, which she has no qualms about inventing, or rather colouring, of his blunders in the practice.” “I know her very well, sir; her care-for-nobody manner and her shrewdness have often amused me,” said Bradshaw. “She is an odd fish, sir. To speak plainly, she has been a harlot, is a hag, though she pretends to be religious; and, I have no doubt, often feels so. Nancy is good-natured, when unprovoked, and generous to the poor and miserable of her own class. She has, withal, a great observation of character; and she knows the private history, and the little indiscretions of every member of the bar. As a jockey would say, sir, she can strike the sore place —offend her, and she'll do it. For many years, she has, every morning while the court sat, arranged her table in the area, and sold cakes and apples. When the old court stood, sir, she frequently made her appearance there with a figure and finery widely in contrast with her present appearance. She was then, though none of the youngest, even then, quite a good-looking woman, with a bright eye, fine teeth, and a fair complexion. Since, she has had the small-pox, has lost her teeth, and her face is the very fac simile of an old saddle-cover. I like to speculate upon character, sir; my profession has led me a great deal among mankind, when they were moved by the deepest and darkest emotions. I have discovered this, that many a one, whom we would think, at first glance, entirely depraved, often cherishes affections of the gentlest and holiest character. Not only has Nancy good points of character,—some of the best,—but she had an affection for a drunken husband, a worthless dog in every respect, that was unsurpassed. Nancy had been a camp girl, in the revolution. She could tell as many tales of some of the British officers, as she can of our bar, sir. Well, her husband deserted, and miraculously escaped, and she with him. They settled here when the war was over, and they lived near the old court-house. When he would lay out o' nights, in his drunken frolics, she would search the whole town for him: it was then small, and could be searched. I remember her well, with the light in her hand, looking and inquiring after him. Well, sir, she found him, one night, crushed to death, in the street: a vehicle of some kind had passed over his neck. On her own shoulders, unassisted, she took him home. I have seen criminals, sir, on the eve of condemnation, and on the eve of being executed, and I have seen their relatives and friends with them, in every variety of wo—but I never saw deeper anguish than that woman exhibited. I happened to meet her bearing the body into her house. Yet she was, at that very time, unfaithful—notoriously so, to her husband; and her unfaithfulness, it is said, caused him to take to the bottle—or, rather, was his apology for taking to it as often as he did. He would drink, he said, any how—but Nancy's ways made him drink more; for, though she did treat him well, and take him out of the gutter, yet he knew where the shoe pinched. Now, the dog knew just what she was before he married her, but he would drink, and wanted an apology. She, being more the soldier of the two, acted upon her own responsibility, and sought no apology or justification for her errors.” Delighted at having a pleased listener, Mr. Shaffer, who had a high respect for Bradshaw, continued—“Josey is another character, sir: the old fellow who sweeps out the court-room—he has followed that vocation ten years, at least. Observe the difference: Nancy knows every suitor and every witness who attends court; Josey about as many as the first day he commenced to sweep it. Every acquaintance that he makes, except with the judge, lawyers, and a few others—who, by some peculiar circumstances, have impressed themselves upon his memory—pass from his recollection, as the sweepings pass from the hall, under his skilful broom. There is quite a taking between old Josey and Nancy. It amuses me often to see him, leaning upon his broom, and her, with her hands poked into her pockets, but with her head set back with an air of other days, conversing together; Josey— “The Lord be merciful to all his people! this is a woful and wicked world!” exclaimed Nancy, who, at this moment, entered the Restaurateur, and threw her basket of apples and cakes on the table, with a total disregard to the fate of its contents; so much so, that several of her best pippins bounced out on to the floor, unnoticed. “The Lord have mercy upon us! this is a wicked world— high and low, rich and poor, are 'bout the same— so much alike as two pippins. Ay, here ye are, Mr. Shaffer, and ye, young Mr. Bradshaw—I put the question to ye, tell me, can a judge take the benefit?” “What! the benefit of the act, Nancy?” asked Shaffer. “Yes, the benefit of the act, as ye call it; getting rid of yer debts by paying nothing,” exclaimed Nancy. “Why, certainly, Nancy, why not? a judge has no privilege from arrest, except when court sits. A judge may go in debt, if people will trust him, just as Judge Harper did; and he may take the benefit, just as I am told the judge has.” “Ay, the thing's done—the Lord love us. Well, I just say this, that the judge has condemned many a better man than he is himself.” “Why, what's the matter, Nancy? is the Judge your debtor?” asked Shaffer. “I have not seen you so much moved since the olde time—since the days of the old court.” “None of yer ripping up old scores, Shaffer, none of that—the old court house is gone, and let by-gones go with it;” replied Nancy, indignantly. “But I am not thinking of myself, now. I am thinking of old Josey Mulvany—the way he has been treated, would rise up in judgment against a saint, if a saint could act so like an unchristian sinner. He is a lone man, as I am a lone woman; many a weary day has he swept yer old court house, or yer new one, I mean, to save a little penny to keep his old age. And where is it? I ask ye, where is it? gone to the prodigalities and abominations of his honour's pleasuring. I'd give my last apple for eggs to pelt him; a pretty Judge to decide right between man and man, and to spend the hard yearnings of a poor old man, trusted to him for safe keeping.” “How much money of Josey's had the Judge, Nancy?” asked Bradshaw. “How much!” exclaimed Nancy, “why, two thousand and five dollars!—hard yearnings, day and night, wet and dry, hungry and cold—just by the labour of his hands, and by the sweat of his brow; for, Josey is not a man who can twist and turn through the world, and pick up fips doing nothing, till he raises dollars. It's sinful—there is a curse in God's providence for such treatment. He looks just as if he thought nothing—like a man sleepy with drink—the heart's heavy when a man looks that way. It's worse than a wake, it's worse than a wake: a man had better be dead than have nothing to live on. If he had so treated me, I be bound I would have spurred up to him. I would let him know a piece of my mind, before a full court-house. Here is Josey, now. Come in, Josey, and take a little comfort.” “A small drap, if you please, Mr. Bunley,” said Josey, with a dejected look, advancing to the bar. “If liquor is made for any thing,” continued Nancy, “'tis for the comfortless. I used to tell my husband, Jonathan Lape—I called him Johnny—says I, `Johnny, there's no 'casion for ye to drink so; ye've got a good house over yer head—(I was the provider, as ye know, Shaffer)—ye've got a good house over yer head, and what for should ye drink?—and so perpetually, like the old sewer?'—for Johnny was a man who would drink any where, and any thing that had drunkenness in it.—`If,' says I, `ye feel a little out of sorts—(as a body, ye know, will feel)— take a little of the best—the best can't hurt ye, but don't drink like a hog in a swill tub. Ye know, yerself Shaffer, that I was true and tender to Johnny.” “I don't know that you were true, Nancy; I thought you were tender,” replied Shaffer.” “Shaffer!” she exclaimed, indignantly, cutting her eye at Josey, to see if he observed the emphasis on true; on observing that he was engaged in swallowing the brandy toddy, and did not; she continued, mildly—“Yes, ye may well say, I was tender to him; for it was on my very door-sill, when I was bearing his dead body—woes me—on these old shoulders—I didn't think he was dead then— I met yerself. An awful night I spent—ye left me to raise some of the neighbours, Shaffer, and a long, long time ye staid—at least, it seemed so, and I dared not leave him for fear he might come to, and want help—he was stone dead.” Here Nancy suppressed her emotions for a moment, and then continued—“I defy the whole world to say but that I buried him decently; and the first money that these hands yearnt, I paid old Philpot fifty dollars—I done part in washing—to put over him a white marble tomb-stone, and ye yerself, Shaffer, wrote the description, (inscription,) for me.” Vol. I. 13 “I did, Nancy,” said Shaffer; and he reached his hand towards her basket, to take a chestnut, which she observing, pushed close up to him, saying, “Help yerself, Shaffer; ye're as welcome as the blossoms in May.” “How did this loss happen, Josey?” inquired Bradshaw. “Why, sir,” replied Josey, “I thought a judge couldn't break; and folks kept talking and talking agin the savings' bank—so I told the judge one day, when I was sweeping out, that I somehow thought the bank was rickerty-like—and I axed him if he would take care o' my money; he said he would, and I gin it to him—that was next Christmas come a year. This morning I was belated, and I was jist a dusting round the insolents' (insolvents) room, when the clark was reading about the benefit of the act people, and I heard the judge's name—I thought a judge couldn't take the benefit—and it was read off plain debtor to Joseph Mulvany two thousand and five dollars—it ought to have been two thousand and ten, for I gave him five yesterday—I couldn't help calling right out to know if that was me, and Mr. Blakely said it was—the brush fell naterally right out o' my hand; and I don't know what's happened since.” “Don't be afraid of the drop, Josey, it can't hurt ye; and come home and take a mouthful o' warm dinner with me. Ye can leave yer lone bit in the court till another time.” After taking a “drop” herself, Nancy and Josey departed together to her house. For some time, there had been a matrimonial engagement, depending between these two; and after they had got to Nancy's house, and had dinner and a few more drops of comfort, Nancy, between-whiles, telling Josey of the hardships of the war, by way of reconciling him to his misfortunes as evening approached, said, “Now, Josey, I'll jist speak to you like a plain honest woman. Yer situation at the court-house being all alone in that ere big building at night, and you getting old, was ventersome—for afflictions strike old people sometimes at once—and I am old and lone—so the word has been spoken between us, ye know, that we would come together. Now, if yer two thousand and five—or ten, it ought to be—dollars were safe, Josey, ye, yerself, would have to axe for the time, and get the license. But you mustn't go to that big building to-night—ye'll feel sad and awsome—if ye staid here, folks would scandalize an old woman, and it becomes us to nuss a good name: so, if ye e'en say so, I'll jist step to the court afore it shuts, and get the clark to make a license, and I'll stop in to Parson Gowler's, and bring him along.” That evening, Nancy was made Mrs. Mulvany.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. Bradshaw appeared for Garson, made a very able defence for him, and he was acquitted. This, with his previous reputation as a speaker, and a young man of great talents, threw him into a very extensive criminal practice. He defended every one who applied to him, from a petty larceny, through all the grades of crime. In this way, he became acquainted with almost every criminal, and with every constable, watchman, and rioter in the city. One day, Jekyl called to see him, and invited him to his wedding. “I am going to be married,” said he, “to-morrow evening. I have a shop of my own now, as you know, and I am doing a pretty good business. “How do you come on with that newspaper?” asked Bradshaw. “Why, I assist Branson in writing for it occasionally; he thinks my plain way of scribbling, and my being a mechanic, help it along with my brother mechanics. When I first wrote little pieces for my own amusement, he looked over the grammar and punctuation; but since, I have applied myself hard in what leisure time I had, and I now can write grammatically, I believe, and punctuate with correctness. I attend strictly to my business through the day, but at night, and on Sundays, I study close —and I have learned, while working in my shop, to arrange my ideas, so that I can go home and write them right off. I wish I had more time. I improved myself the most when I was sick, and staid at your father's. It was the happiest time of my life. Rebecca, when we are married, will help me on a good deal. She has some little money, five hundred dollars, with which I can extend my trade; and she makes these patent stocks, by which she gets a good deal. I think I might buy out, probably, Branson, in the Mechanics' Advocate. I should like to do it. But it seems to me like presumption, in taking the control of a paper. It is only a weekly paper, to be sure, but it has a good circulation among the mechanics, and they generally pay well; but I never could make it fashionable, or get it among the merchants.” “I'll tell you what it is, Jekyl,” said Bradshaw; “think seriously on the subject. You can obtain valuable correspondents, I know. There's Willoughby; his sketches of Kentuck character are admirable. Those pieces of his, published in the Patriot, have been copied and praised every where. I saw one of them, the other day, in an English paper, and spoken of very highly. Cavendish is always taking notes of the trials at court, and it would give him the greatest pleasure to furnish you with the leading cases. As for myself, why, you know, if I can do any thing for you, I am entirely at your service, not only in the way of scribbling, 13* but, if you are pushed to pay off your hands, I could occasionally help you out. I obtain pretty heavy fees from some of the rascals whom I defend. I sometimes spend them in books—all sorts—see how I have stocked my library—or in other ways, which don't make me such a grateful return—and if you would come and borrow it from me, and pay it when you choose—when it is convenient—it would do me a service, for I should study more and feel better. Think well on it first, Jekyl, and when you decide—if you let me know some time before you take hold—I can obtain for you some communications that may be of service to you. So to-morrow night you are to be Benedict, the married man, hey? Well, I don't know when my turn will come.” On the appointed evening, Bradshaw attended the wedding, and was delighted with the unsophisticated character of the couple. He met there many of Jekyl's friends, with whom he was very popular. It was late when he left; and he stopped at a grocery, kept by a celebrated electioneering character, near by, which made him very late on his way home. It was a cloudy night; the wind blew in gusts, and the lamps, not being well protected from it, shed an uncertain beam, which rendered objects indistinct and deceptive. Sometimes the wind would entirely subside, and the flame of the lamp would be erect, shedding over the pavement a steady track of light; but, in an instant, objects would be so changed to the eye of Bradshaw by the flying dust and flickering flame, that he would fancy impediments in his way, and turn to avoid a shadow. Having found some difficulty in passing up the Main Street, owing to obstructions consequent upon laying and repairing the hydrant pipes, in that more public way, Bradshaw took a round-about direction, and entered a more lonely and less respectable avenue. Several outrages had been committed at this period upon passengers; and in the loneliness of the place, and from its character, Bradshaw, though courageous, felt that there was very little chance of assistance, should he be beset. The night grew darker, and the gusts of wind louder and more frequent—in the pauses of the gusts his steps sounded along the streets without any interruption to their echoes. All at once a voice broke forth from a by-street, leading into the one on which he trod some ten or fifteen yards above him; and, as he advanced, he heard a person, who seemed to be a lad, say, “Don't hold me so tight.” Some one replied, very gruffly, “I know you of old, you young rascal; you have escaped me before, but you don't do it this time, by gad. You think you've a right to set the town to rights, do you? I've set it to rights, too, I can tell you; this very night I made one of your fellows feel this pantron, though he was a man, and had stolen a genteel suit to play gentleman in.” “I've been with nobody but Carnish, and big Bob, to-night,” replied the other; “and the street is as good for me as it is for you, though you be a watchman.” “Where is he now?” “I don't know,” was the reply. “If I get you into the jail once, I'll have it poured into you—now mind me. They say you have been stealing, and to jail you go.” By this time the persons entered the street in which Bradshaw was, at the moment he reached the intersection. They proved to be a watchman and a lad, both of whom Bradshaw recognised. The watchman was a strong, athletic man, named Johnson, who was known to be cruel, and at once a coward and a bully, and vindictive in the extreme. The boy was called Fritz, a notorious character, and known to the police for his viciousness, and a certain dash of wild justice and magnanimity which blazed out in his worst actions. He had several times been indicted for assaults and house-breakings; but he had always contrived to escape, either by his own ingenuity or that of his counsel. He possessed one striking virtue in the eye of a lawyer—he always paid his fee: and if he had no money to pay it at the time the service was rendered, his promise to pay was religiously kept. Bradshaw had twice appeared for him, and had succeeded in getting him off; he had a sort of liking for him. Without letting Fritz know that he recognised him, Bradshaw said to the watchman, “Johnson, how are you? I see you are a good officer.” “Ay, lawyer, is that you,” replied Johnson, in a tone of assumed frankness, though it wanted the real click. “I expect I've got a case for you,— this fellow's been going the nag again. I suppose you'll be for clearing him; though I hope you'll” and he spoke angrily, “not think it necessary to abuse me to do it, as you did before.” “Why, Johnson,” replied Bradshaw, “you must not blame me, my good fellow. I did what I could for my client; and I puffed you up in another case —a sin for which I have yet to account; and let me tell you, a much greater one than the other;— Fritz, how goes it? I see you're in durance vile.” “Vile enough, sir,” replied the boy; “but I didn't expect to see you down our way.” Bradshaw explained why he was there; and as the watchmen led Fritz towards the watch-house, which was precisely in his route, though many squares off, he walked on with them. Johnson was evidently displeased, and Fritz as evidently pleased, that Bradshaw had joined them. The accusation of theft, which Johnson had made against the boy, had dashed him; for he inquired, in an anxious tone, of Bradshaw, if he would be his lawyer. Bradshaw replied that he would, and was on the eve of lecturing him on his course of life and its inevitable consequences, thinking it a fit occasion to produce an impression upon him, when he recollected that it would be of no use in the presence of the watchman. They walked along in silence for some time; Bradshaw had fallen behind, and the watchman strode on before, holding the boy by the collar, and almost dragging him along. After many steps in silence, Bradshaw heard the watchman say, as if unconscious of their presence, and speaking to himself, “I had a d—l of a rough scrape along here before to-night.” “What did you remark, Johnson?” asked Bradshaw. “Nothing,” replied the watchmen; “only there is a good many spats along here, by these lanes and alleys; and I reckon, if this fellow, (shaking Fritz) goes the voyage, there will be some less.” Here the watchman and his charge crossed a narrow lane, which intersected the street. Bradshaw had fallen so far behind, that he did not reach the crossing until they had passed it. He heard footfalls, as he thought, approaching in the lane, and, as he was about crossing it, he saw a person start from under a door-way, as if he had stepped from concealment, and he heard a voice say, “Cor, hist!” or “Cornish!” he could not determine which, “we must save him before he gits to the watch-house.” A gust of wind caused the lamp at the corner to waver, just as Bradshaw stepped past it, and the form was lost in darkness. He stopped for a moment to listen, and tried to penetrate the shade, but in vain; he saw nor heard no more, except the utterance of his own name spoken, in a tone as if to inform another person who he was. Under all the circumstances,—Fritz being his client, the watchman a malicious fellow, who was, perhaps, transcending his duty, Bradshaw did not feel himself bound to communicate to him what he had heard; for if he did, it might not prevent the attempt at a rescue, and the watchman would spring his rattle, and raise an excitement, which might militate against Fritz on his trial. It, also, would greatly have added to the unkindness of the boy's treatment. Johnson hated Fritz for some pranks of old, which he had played him, and he only wanted the least colour of excuse to cloak his revenge. Bradshaw determined to turn down the next cross lane, that he might not be a witness of the affray, if one should arise. He reflected— from the person at the corner naming him, that he was known; and he thought it more than probable his presence would have no effect in deterring them from their designs. They knew him, perhaps, to be Fritz's counsel, being his friends they had most likely witnessed his trial, in which Bradshaw drew Johnson's character in no flattering colours, and they of course believed him to be well disposed toward his client, and no favourer of Johnson. By this time they had reached the cross street; and Bradshaw remarked, “I go this way— so good night to you.” Fritz said, in a subdued voice, “Good night, sir; but don't forget me.” “You know I will not, Fritz,” said Bradshaw; while Johnson remarked, “Well, Lawyer, if you will go that way, good night to you.” They parted, Bradshaw turning down the cross lane. He pursued his way, thinking over the characters of the individuals whom he had just left. Fritz, he fancied, under different circumstances might have been all that was noble, while, thought he, it would require all the regenerating influence of Christianity, of which my father is so fond of speaking, to make any thing of Johnson, but a low, selfish, cunning knave. Bradshaw determined, if he met Fritz's friends, whom he thought he knew, though not by name, to advise them against attempting his rescue. The lane and the surrounding neighbourhood were filled with persons of the lowest order, and of the most depraved habits. Bradshaw was in their very head quarters. However, on he went, regardless of what might be the consequence. The lane, though long, was lighted but by two lamps, placed at either end: there had been one in the middle, but it had been so often broken and replaced, that at last not even the post was left by those who like not the tell-tale glare. As Bradshaw approached the place where it had stood, three men passed him; he could distinguish that one of them had on a cloak, and that all had clubs, but he could discern no more. One of them struck with his club three times on the pavement as they passed, and almost immediately afterwards, it was observed, “He's not one of us; he's a ruffled shirt fellow: let's bring him to.” Bradshaw felt that he was in some danger, but he resolved, as the best means of acting, to meet them as they turned to overtake him. “Who are you?” inquired one of them, very roughly. “A friend, if you give me no cause to be your enemy,” replied Bradshaw, in a calm, but fearless tone. “It's Mr. Bradshaw, who was Fritz's lawyer,” whispered one of them to his companions, which Bradshaw overheard. “I tell you what it is, boys,” said Bradshaw; “I don't know who you are, and if I suspect truly what you are after, I don't want to know, for if you attack Johnson, you will only get yourselves into trouble—I may be compelled to be a witness against you—and you can't save Fritz.” “Fritz! Fritz! in danger,” exclaimed all of them at once, “we must save him, come what may.” From this, Bradshaw thought he discovered that they were not the persons whose conversation he had overheard at the corner. He, therefore, told them the circumstance, knowing that, if they thought Fritz had friends at hand to save him from the clutches of Johnson, they would not follow after him. He remarked, also, “Boys, you had better let it alone. I will do what I can for Fritz, and you could not overtake them before they got to the watch-house, or to that part of the city where Johnson could get speedy help, if you should attack him.” “You are in great danger, in being here, sir,” said one of them; “for there has been a great fuss in the lane to-night, and the boys are up, with the devil in them.” “I am in the middle of the stream, boys; returning is as bad as going on. What shall I do?” They conversed with each other apart, about, as Bradshaw thought, giving him the “word,” as they called it. One was in favour of giving it, while the others strenuously opposed it. “But we must see him through,” said one of the opposers, “for he helped Fritz out of two scrapes, and, if he takes a lark's case in hand, he's true as steel—as if he took a king's—and he can just about fan that d—d states attorney out.” They came up to Bradshaw, and the one with the cloak, assuming to be spokesman, said, “We will Vol. I. 14 walk with you to the end of what we call our bounds, sir.” “If you think that I am in danger, I will be obliged to you, if you will,” said Bradshaw. Attended by these guardians, Bradshaw proceeded onward; the one with the cloak walking by his side, and the others behind. They did not straggle along in the reckless manner in which such characters generally deport themselves; but, on the contrary, they walked like persons who had purposes and reflections of a decided, perhaps, sombre cast. Connecting all this with the watchman's manner and conversation, Bradshaw could not but think something serious had occurred. They walked on in silence, till they heard foot-falls a-head of them, when one of the two behind stepped before Bradshaw, and joined the persons advancing. Some conversation took place between himself and them, and he walked with them until they met Bradshaw; when he took his place beside his comrade, and the others passed on. The persons who passed were three in number, and, as far as Bradshaw could guess, in the almost total darkness that surrounded them, one was Fritz. After a moment or two, Bradshaw broke silence, by asking, “What is the reason that the street is so still? I have understood that there were fun and frolic going on here at all hours.” “Why,” said the one beside him, “there was a ball here to-night, at Dean's, and one man, that nobody knew, was dirked, and another clubbed —they pretended to be first-rates—the watchmen came down and there was a scatterment—I believe, one of the chaps quarrelled with the watchman—the boys soon got to covey.” Here a door opened, and a light streamed forth. It occurred to Bradshaw, that his companion with the cloak seemed anxious to avoid his observation; for, as the light shone upon them, he stepped back to those behind. The wind was blowing furiously: in a moment, it died away, when a startling shriek was heard in the direction of the house from which the light had appeared. “There was no fun in that holler,” said one of the “boys.” He had scarcely spoken, when a voice, seemingly that of a woman, was heard, apparently, in mortal difficulty, exclaiming, “Oh, God, are there none to help me! For mercy's sake, sir, for mercy.” “Boys!” exclaimed Bradshaw, buttoning his coat, “I can't stand this, I must see what's the matter.” As he spoke, he ran towards the house. “Mr. Bradshaw, you had better not; something will happen to you,” exclaimed they all at once— but, unhearing or unheeding, Bradshaw rushed on: he opened the street door of a mean frame house, where he thought he heard the voice of distress, and stopped to listen. In a moment, he heard another cry, which seemed to be at his very ear. He stepped hurriedly in, and fell, in consequence of the floor being lower than the street. He started to his feet, unhurt, and saw a light through a crack of the door; as he advanced towards it, a voice said in supplication, “Indeed, I'm not what you take me for.” “Not what you take her for!” exclaimed a female voice, tauntingly, “She yells as if she was the Virgin Mary, instead of the trull of any body.” Another cry for help, and Bradshaw burst open the door and sprang into the room. On the floor, in one corner, shrinking from a ruffian, as if she would have pressed herself through the wall, was a beautiful girl, in the most fashionable attire, with her hair loose upon her shoulders, and her bonnet off of her head, but confined to her person by the string holding it to her neck; her dress was disordered, her cloak on the floor, and her whole appearance and manner, but too plainly told her fears. In another corner of the room was a bed, on which were lying, with their tawdry finery on, two women whose characters a glance could read, and who were, evidently, much intoxicated: by their bed stood an old stained table, on which were a light and a bottle of liquor. A fire burned on the hearth, and was supplied with fuel from another corner of the room, where a quantity of old barrel staves, and shavings were scattered about. In the opposite corner to that in which were the women, was another bed. Standing over the girl, and holding her by the wrist, was a ferocious-looking ruffian, whom Bradshaw recognised in a moment, as one who had been found guilty of stabbing a man with intent to murder, and who had contrived to escape from the officers, as they were taking him to the jail late on the evening of his condemnation: a reward of one hundred dollars had been offered by the sheriff for his apprehension. He had, just before Bradshaw entered, removed a wig and pair of false whiskers from his head and face, and was in the act of throwing them on the bed when Bradshaw stood before him. He started, and involuntarily attempted to replace them—finding that he was seen, he mashed them in his hand, and exclaimed, facing Bradshaw, “What do you want here?” “I heard the cry for help, sir, as I was passing by,” said Bradshaw, “and I came in to see what was the matter.” “Save me, for God's sake, sir, save me!” exclaimed the girl, springing towards Bradshaw. “I have been misled here; I know not these people.” “Not know me, Jane Durham! look at me now, and know me,” exclaimed the man. She looked at him intently for a moment, clasped her hands, and exclaimed—“My God! Henry Adams. But, sir,” said she, wildly, turning to Bradshaw, “I did not know him until this moment—and if I do, he has no claims upon me. I am nothing to him. O, sir, if you love your sister—if you love your mother—protect me.” “Do not be alarmed—certainly I will,” said Bradshaw. “Certainly you will!—will you?” exclaimed Adams. “What claims have you to her, sir? Is she your w—?” “She is not,” said Bradshaw; “nor shall she be yours, without her consent.” “Go, you ruffle-shirted rascal! Begone!— leave that thing where you found her, or I'll brain you.” The third word had scarcely passed the man's 14* lips, ere Bradshaw rushed to the hearth, in which some of the bricks were loose, seized one, and hurled it at him. It missed him, just grazing his head, and made a great hole in the plaster of the wall where it struck. When Bradshaw moved to the hearth, Adams thought that he was leaving Jane Durham (the girl) through fear of him, and he advanced, and again seized her. She shrieked fearfully. Bradshaw caught up the part of a hooppole, three feet in length, and thick, from the rubbish in the corner, and Adams had just time to dodge his head, when the stick descended with such force upon his shoulder as to fell him to the ground. “Murder! murder!” exclaimed Adams. “Moll, call the larks. Don't murder me—don't murder me.” Here one of the women staggered to a door in the side of the wall, and the other leaped from the bed, and, with a demoniac countenance and the most horrible imprecations, advanced upon Jane Durham. Bradshaw seized the woman by the shoulder, and, with a violent shove, pushed her into the heap of rubbish;—at that very moment, Adams, who had recovered his feet, sprang and caught him by the throat. “You shall die the death!” said Adams, as he pressed him to the floor. Bradshaw's presence of mind, on the instant, saved him. He seized Adams as he fell under him, and, as if there were a posse of watchmen at the door, called out, “Come on, Johnson; we have the prize!” The ruffian let go his grasp in a moment. Bradshaw, who wanted him to run, still affected to hold him. They struggled an instant, when Adams broke away, and, with the speed of thought, disappeared through the door, up the stairway, where one of the women had gone. Bradshaw caught up the girl's cloak; threw it around her, and hurried her into the street. They had scarcely proceeded ten steps, when Adams, discovering the artifice which had been practised by Bradshaw, mustered his associates, who were rioting up stairs, and rushed out in hot pursuit, determined on revenge. As soon as Bradshaw heard them burst open the door, he drew the girl into the skeleton of an old frame building, whose windows, doors, and floors were gone; and they hid from observation in the angle formed by the chimney. They had scarcely placed themselves there, when the ruffians reached the house. “Run on a-head, Joe,” said Adams; “Pete and Blackey have gone the other way. May be,” continued he, to his companion, “they've hid in some of these old buildings. I'll kill 'em, by hell, if I come across 'em.” Saying this, Adams entered the door. “Come on,” said he, to his companion. “No, I won't,” said the other, “without a light. If he's such a desperate chap as you say, he'll blow a man's brains out, or dirk him, in the dark.” Adams paused a moment; and then seeing part of the white dress of the girl, spread, as it were, against the wall, as she crouched into the corner, he entered, with uplifted club, and, with all his force, struck the dress within an inch of her head. Just as Adams struck, Bradshaw, whose dark dress prevented him from being seen, but who could see the faint outline of his adversary's person between him and the door, grasped the hooppole, which he still retained after the encounter in the house, and dealt Adams such a fearful blow over the head, that the ruffian fell senseless to the ground, like a lump of lead, without uttering a groan. Adams's companion, at the door, ran off, without saying a word. Bradshaw put his hand down, and felt the temples of Adams; finding that he was perfectly senseless, he caught the hat from his head, felt by his side for the club, and whispered the girl in a quick, low voice—“Take off your bonnet, and put on this hat. Courage!—my pretty girl, courage!—our lives depend on it!— There, wrap your cloak round you. Don't let the wind blow your cloak open, and show your white dress. Here, take this club in your hand—carry it under your arm, as a watchman carries his pontoon. If we meet them, don't you say one word; but, if we get into a row, while I engage them, do you escape.” “O! don't leave me! don't leave me!” said the girl. By this time they had stepped over Adams, and entered the street. The wind still blew in wild gusts, while, occasionally, it was still as a summer's eve. Fortunately for Bradshaw and his charge, it was darker than it had been; though the drifting clouds occasionally permitted the star-light to appear. Away before them, in the distance, they saw the faint glimmering of the lamp, at the end of the lane. “Don't put your arms through the arm-hole of your cloak—they will discover you by your white sleeves. Step as firmly as you can,” continued Bradshaw, in a whisper, as they walked on. “Give me that hat, and take mine: that covers your eyes, and you can't see where you tread. No! no! give me mine again: the rim is so narrow 'twill show your curls, if a light should flash on us. No, no, I must not let you take my arm; if they should meet us, they will take us for dandies at once, and attack us.” They rapidly approached the lamp at the end of the lane. As they advanced, though Bradshaw could not hear steps, yet he knew there was some one approaching, for, every now and then, something would obstruct the gleam of the light. All was darkness and silence; not a light could be seen from any of the houses, nor a voice heard. Bradshaw was satisfied that, if they got into any difficulty, he must rely upon his personal strength, and what stratagem he might practise; and he felt now his perilous situation more than he had before. The steps of persons advancing were now distinctly heard. “Step firmly, my brave girl—step firmly,” said Bradshaw, in a quick whisper; and, when he got within ear-shot of the approaching persons, he said, in an angry, decided tone, that made the poor girl at his elbow start, and grasp his arm—“Here come two other watchmen;—we must turn back with them, Johnson, and join the watchman above, and catch that scoundrel and his gang: there's a reward offered for them.” As soon as they heard this, away they ran, cutting across the lane. One was the fellow who ran away from the door when Bradshaw knocked down Adams, and the other was the person whom Adams had sent on to overtake Bradshaw. Bradshaw and his charge passed on to the lamp in safety. He could not but smile, as the light struck the beautiful features of the girl, to behold the inappropriateness of the ruffian's hat, with the delicate and chiselled outlines and lady curls which it shaded; and then the club under her arm, and the masculine step which she affected, contrasted strangely with the extreme delicacy of her form, and the fright and anguish upon her countenance. Her face lighted up with a wild gleam of joy, as they passed the light; but it was succeeded by an expression, sad as the gloom of the darkness that, in a moment more, encompassed them. Bradshaw began to reflect, as he hurried rapidly on, that, perhaps, he had killed Adams; and that he had endangered his own life for a girl whose character could hardly be good—for one, at least, of whom he knew nothing—for whom he had acted knight-errant, and was leading, he knew not where. “Well,” thought he, “be this girl who she may, if she is frail, she is beautiful; and if she does sell her favours, she has, at least, the right to decide who shall be purchaser. Besides, her great distress was evident; and be that as it may, I would have served the scoundrel right, who dared to use such language to me, if I had killed him on the spot.” As these thoughts passed rapidly through his mind, Bradshaw conducted his charge on, and they entered the street to which the lane led, and which was parallel to the one where Bradshaw met Johnson and Fritz. The street on which they had entered led to the heart of the city, and to what is not always characteristic of the hearts of things or men, its most respectable part. Bradshaw had just cheered the girl, and told her they were out of danger; when, immediately before them, as the stars twinkled forth, and the gusts of wind ceased for a moment, they saw five or six men standing in a strange silence. “What shall be done?” said one of them, whose voice Bradshaw thought was Johnson's, the watchman's; “these fellows have murdered the man! shall we leave him till morning?” “Leave him till morning—no, that's against the regulations; there is no place where we can put him, and he must be taken to the watch-house. Johnson, step up to the next light—there's some boxes there—you can put one against the wall, and get the light out—shade it with your hand, and bring it here, and let us see who he is.” A strange thrill ran through every nerve in Bradshaw's body. “It's no use,” said Johnson, “to get the light. I shall break my neck, may be, in getting on the box.” “Johnson, I don't know what's got in to you to-night,” said the other man. “Here, some of you hold his head up till I run for the light.” The man accordingly went. “Let us cross over to the other side,” said the girl, “and hurry on.” “No, no,” said Bradshaw, “I want to see who the man is.” Bradshaw stepped up to the men, just as the one who had gone for the light returned with it. He recognised Johnson, and thought he had not his usual officiousness. As the light shone upon the faces of the by-standers, Johnson turned and discovered Bradshaw. “Ah! Mr. Bradshaw,” said he, “this is a late hour, I did not think you were such a bold rover. There's danger in these places.” “I've found it so,” said Bradshaw, anxiously pressing by Johnson to look upon the body. It was that of a middle-aged man, as far as Bradshaw could see by the light, dressed in a new suit; and he looked as if he were not a townsman. The features were rough and pallid; and across the right eyebrow there was a terrible gash. The hair was matted with blood—the eye glazed—the muscles of the whole face relaxed—the mouth half open, and the lip livid. “He's as cold as a wagon-tire.” said the watchman who held the light. “Who knows him?” “Feel his pulse,” said Bradshaw; and, as he spoke, he stooped and felt it himself. “He's not dead; his pulse beats faintly—very. You'd better break up one of these boxes, form a litter, and carry him to the watch-house.” The watchman with the light, held it up to the features of Bradshaw, to see who it was that had the presumption to speak so authoritatively to the guardians of the night; but, on discovering Bradshaw, he said—“Yes, Lawyer, that'll be the best way.” “Jones,” said Bradshaw, addressing him, “step here, one moment: let me say a word to you.” As Jones and Bradshaw walked apart, Johnson approached close to them, seemingly with the most intense anxiety to hear what Bradshaw was communicating. Bradshaw told Jones that Adams was up the alley, and advised him to go up and take him, and get the reward. “But, can't you go with us to show us the place,” asked Jones. “I might, but for this person whom I defended against him. How far must I escort you, my fair ally?” “Oh! Mr. Bradshaw, don't leave me,” said she. “Cannot one of these watchmen see you home, Miss?” asked Jones. “Yes, yes, sir, any thing, if Mr. Bradshaw is engaged.” “I'll see you home myself, my pretty ally,” said Bradshaw, “come, take my arm and we will go. Perhaps I should not wish him farther harm, as he is, doubtless, hurt already; but he stabbed a man under very aggravated circumstances, and his conduct to you shows that he deserves punishment— that he should not be permitted to go at large.” “I don't want him hurt,” said the girl,” but, I wish he was away—I don't like to be in the city where he is. My God! there seems to be a fatality that dogs me like a blood hound. Those women, those women on the bed! shall I ever be what they are? Mr. Bradshaw, how shall I express my gratitude, and what is the gratitude of one like me?” Vol. I. 15 “Don't think of that, my fair ally. I declare, you make a right good watchman. Which way shall we turn?” “This way, if you please, sir; I live in the two story brick, in the lane, just above Mr. Glassman's.” “Ah, just above Mr. Glassman's! Do you know Mr. Glassman?” “Yes, sir,” said she, faintly. “He left town to-day, I believe?” “Yes, sir, I believe he did.” Bradshaw was anxious to ask her concerning the ruffian Adams, and how she came in the house; and at the mention of Glassman's name, he felt a much greater curiosity, but he refrained from asking any questions; as it was evident to him she did not wish to speak of herself, and if questioned, in the overflow of her feelings, she might tell something which she afterwards would regret having revealed—and farther, when Glassman was named, it occurred to him, she might be so situated with regard to that gentleman, that delicacy towards him required he should not seek her confidence. They soon passed the residence of Glassman, and arrived at hers; she passed quickly up the steps— three in number—supporting herself by the railing. “Walk in, sir,” said she to Bradshaw. “Thank you, my fair ally, but 'tis late.” “Do walk in one moment, sir,” said she, “till I see that all is safe.” They found the door unlocked, and they walked in together—she threw the room door open; the room was small, but elegantly furnished. It contained a sofa, a side-table,—full of books,—and a piano: many beautiful pictures adorned the wall. On the table burned a candle that glimmered in the socket. Lying on the hearth-rug, before the fire, asleep, was a black servant girl. “Phœbe,” exclaimed Jane Durham, pushing her with her foot, “Phœbe, get up, get up.” The servant started, and seeing her mistress with Adams' hat upon her head, she exclaimed, “thieves!” lustily, taking her for a robber. “Don't you know me?” said her mistress, throwing the hat on the floor. “Bless me, Miss Jane! Miss Jane Durham!” said the servant, clasping her hands together—“I've been looking every where for you. I wondered, and wondered. Oh! I've been so frightened.” Here she rubbed her eyes, and saw Bradshaw, she started, looked at her mistress for a moment, and said no more. “Shut the door, Phœbe,” said her mistress, “and hand Mr. Bradshaw some refreshments, from the side-board in the next room. Will you take wine, sir, or something stronger?” Bradshaw, who felt chilled and somewhat exhausted, smiled, and said, he would take something stronger—the direction was, accordingly, given to the servant Bradshaw could now more closely and calmly observe Miss Durham; she could not be twenty. She was very beautiful, her features regular and delicate, her eye dark and dazzling, and the expression of her countenance shifting and variable. Her form corresponded with her features. Bradshaw could not but observe the beauty of her hand, and the paleness of her brow, as she sat on the sofa, and without looking in to the glass arranged her hair. Her manner was forced—for, while adjusting her curls, and conversing with Bradshaw, she would gaze for a moment, thoughtfully—anxiously—and then, by an effort, appear self-possessed and cheerful. After partaking of some refreshment, Bradshaw rose to depart. “May I hope to see you again, sir?” said Miss Durham, with rather a confused air. “Certainly, I anticipate that pleasure, my brave and beautiful ally,” said Bradshaw, shaking hands with her, as he left the room. She followed him to the front door, and said— “Mr. Bradshaw, think of me as you may,—be what I may, my gratitude shall not be less pure or less enduring.” “Don't speak of that, don't speak of that. Good night to you;” and he pressed her hand once more, and departed. “Well,” thought Bradshaw, as his solitary step echoed along the pavement, “this is an adventure. How that villain pressed my throat! With what lightning-like rapidity one thinks, when in danger! There is no doubt of it, excitement goes a great way in developing mind. I thought of my whole life, in an instant, when that villain sprang upon me. Great revolutions call forth intellect. Why? Not only because every thing is turned topsy turvy then, but because, surrounded by peril, man's ingenuity and intellect are more active—he must escape the dangers that continually threaten life and limb,—sagacity, like a sentinel on a watch-tower, encompassed by the enemy, must not only be wakeful, but ever watchful. A bonnie lassie, and Glassman! How he reminds me of Sir Roger de Coverley —honest, where women are not concerned. Well, this vice is a pleasant thing, but the responsibility —the responsibility.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">15* CHAPTER XII. About twelve o'clock the next day, as Bradshaw was seated in his office, he heard a voice down stairs, exclaiming, “Bradshaw, where are ye, man?” “Here, Nancy; walk up.” “Yer a pretty attorney and counsellor at law, to have yer office up into a third story. Do ye think, man, that the people will be pilgrimating up to ye? Have ye got already to be a counsellor of such importance?” “No, Nancy, not exactly; I am not a counsellor at all, yet.” “Not a counsellor! What do ye mean? Ye have paid me my fee—a five dollar bill, instead of a one—Scrags, that lump of meanness, refused that —and generous ye were. Ha'n't ye admitted yet? Ye are funning. I have heard ye often plead.” “Why, not to the civil court yet, Mrs. Mulvaney; only to the criminal; and I was admitted there to defend a friend of mine. I have no great anxicty to begin the practice, until I know more about it. I mean the civil practice.” “Ye speak like a wise man, for a young one: 'Taint always the horse that's first entered that wins the race.” “You are right, Mrs. Mulvany.” “Don't Mrs. Mulvany me, now, Bradshaw; call me Nancy. Nancy, I may say, is my born name; for I've had it all my born days. Mrs. Mulvany is well enough with folks that don't know me. Not that I'm ashamed of Josey's name. It would make any lone woman like me respectable. But Nancy my first husband always called me, and Nancy I like folks to call me; for sometimes a voice seems like his, and it puts me in mind of times long gone, when I was young, and my name sounded to me, and most when Richard called it, like a bird's note in spring time.” “Nancy, you are sentimental this morning.” “Sentimental! if ye mean, by that, high-flying notions that don't turn out true, it's wrong to nuss them. They come across all of us sometimes. Bradshaw, do ye know the girl, Jane Durham?” Bradshaw smiled at the penetrating glance Nancy cast on him, and said, “I saw her last night.” “Did you never see her before last night?” “Not that I remember of, yet it seems to me that I have; but Nancy, must I undergo a cross examination?” “Not if it will criminate yerself, Bradshaw, as ye lawyers say; but the poor girl is in a woful trouble, and she thinks that ye can help her out. She was a kind of crazy like this morn—and she called on yer name, but not like a poor thing in histeriky fits, calls on a man that has misused and deceived her. I ha'n't felt for a human cretur so much for manys the day. She says that ye can help her out of her trouble, and she wants to see ye. Will ye go?” “What's the matter with her, Nancy?” “What's the matter!—why, the poor thing's accused of murder, outright murder, and Johnson the watchman—the wretch!—to treat a woman so—dragged her from her bed early this morn before Squire Bailley, and the Squire committed her to prison. I met them as I was going to market to get some of the best fruit,—ye know if a body don't go early, they can't get the best—and he was dragging her on in a manner, that made me berate him till he behaved more decenter. And, as I knowed the poor girl, apples and every thing jest went clean out o' my head, and I went with her. She told the magistrate that ye could tell where she was in the night? Johnson don't like ye—does he?” “I believe not,” replied Bradshaw. “I jist saw as much, for he treated her worse when she spoke of ye, and he wanted to drag her all the way over to the jail. But I opened on him—and made him get a back—and I paid for it myself, and went with the poor thing to the jail. I wanted to get the jailer, old Presley to do well by her, and he would and wanted to, but Johnson spoke so by her, that he locked her up in the common room. Johnson abused her for every thing.” The dark spot gathered on Bradshaw's brow till it lowered with the fiercest passion, which Nancy observing, remarked— “Bradshaw, if the poor thing is any thing to ye, if ye've ta'en her from Glassman and she's yer mistress, as ye call it, yer bound to do by her.” Bradshaw here hastily explained to Nancy all he knew of the girl, and of the events of the previous night, and asked—“What of her and Glassman?” “Why, as ye know Glassman so well, Bradshaw, being as yer so often with him, I thought ye knew his character, but may be he did not like to tell a young man, and a man kind and smooth-spoken, and looking like ye, of such things. I bethought me, when the girl spoke of ye, how ye stood. And as I used to call to see her, and sell her apples, and she never spoke of ye, I did not know what to make of it—but when the heart's wrung, it says what at other times it hides. Well, it's jest so—is it? Ye must do yer best for her, Bradshaw.” “Assuredly I will, Nancy; but who is she accused of murdering?—who is she?—where is Glassman?” “Why, she is jest accused of murdering—a man in—lane last night, I couldn't gather much of the case afore the magistrate, only I know that Johnson swore hard agin her.” “Did he swear that he saw the man stabbed by her?” “Yes! yes! he swore every thing.” “Who is she, Nancy?” “Why, she jist lives in the little brick above Glassman's, in the lane. She is with Glassman. She never told any thing about herself—and she has such a way, that I never asked her. Though she be `a mother, an' no wife,' as the ballad sings, yet, I tell ye, there's many a wife that's worse. Glassman's gone somewhere, on some spree—God only knows where. I expect the poor thing's been inveigled to Dean's, by some way or other that she didn't dream of. I've no trust in Johnson, and I told him so, plump down. I didn't like the way he acted, no how. But, Bradshaw, ye must go and see the poor thing. It ain't best for a young man to go on these missions—but ye'd best go. Ye was with her last night, and I promised, faithfully, to send ye.” “I'll go, at once,” said Bradshaw. “This is pretty much of a mission for a young man like me, as you say, Nancy. The girl is certainly beautiful, and the impression haunts my mind that I have seen her somewhere. Come, Nancy, suppose you walk over.” “No, I'd best not, honey; it's pretty much of a walk, and ye'd best see her alone. She'll speak more freely to ye. I'll go myself, this afternoon. Poor thing! her trouble's sad to see and hear.” The jail was a considerable distance off, in the outskirts of the city. A wall surrounded it, making a large enclosure. In the jail lived the jailer, with his family, consisting of a wife and three or four children: one of them a grown girl, by a former marriage, named Lucy. Bradshaw knew the jailer, Job Presley, very well. Job, considering his situation, which he had held for many years, was a very kind-hearted fellow. He valued himself greatly on his knowledge of “human natur,” as he pronounced it, and was, also, in his own opinion, a great politician, and acute in the law. Bradshaw understood him exactly; and while most persons thought old Job rough and unfeeling, the fit representative of his profession, in all ages, (as, in fact, he seemed to them,) Bradshaw appreciated him; and, as he loved to study character, he would often stop at the jail to see the prisoners, his clients, and to have a talk with Job, and draw him out. Bradshaw also delighted to chat with his daughter Lucy, whose guilelessness and simplicity, he said, reminded him of the flower blooming in the very shade of the Upas. Lucy had seen and heard enough of vice to know well of it; but it affected her heart no more than would the perusal of the Koran affect the Christian, who had already studied, understood, and been profoundly penetrated by the truths of his Bible. Job's apartments were in one corner of the jail, and were kept as neat, by his tidy little wife, as if they were rooms in a palace. She was a talkative woman,—as what woman is not?—and somewhat self-willed; but she was very kind to her step-daughter, Lucy, and so they got on very well. Job was a forbidding-looking man at first sight, and always so to one who was not an observer. He was quite neat in his dress, for a jailer—for, though his clothing was coarse, and he wore a great jacket, which almost covered his hips, into the pockets of which he generally thrust his hands, yet he kept his apparel scrupulously brushed. He was standing on the steps of the jail—not at the entrance to his own rooms, but to the prison—looking, through the grated gate in the wall, out upon the few passers-by, in the outskirts of the city. The wall was as high as the second story of the jail, and the steps on which Job stood were not fifteen feet from the gate, and directly opposite to it. As soon as Bradshaw came up to the gate, they saw each other. “Job,” said Bradshaw; “how are you? Will you let me in?” “Certainly, Squire, and out whenever you choose, and that's what I can't say to any one in these walls, except to old Job Presley himself.” So speaking, he unlocked the little gate, that was imbodied in the more ponderous one, and let Bradshaw in. Bradshaw shook him cordially by the hand, and Job proceeded, with his usual caution, to turn the key. “Job, what news have you to-day?” asked Bradshaw. “There's rather a stir to-day, sir?— There was a murder committed at Dean's, last night, or somewhere about them lanes, and we've got a pretty girl, a very pretty girl here, on the charge, that don't seem used to these things. I'm glad you've come: she said, she wanted to see you. I expect it's a hard case. Johnson kind of persuaded me she was a common thing, but I didn't believe it, at the time. However, as he seemed to insist upon it so, I thought I'd best be safe, and lock her up with the rest. I asked Johnson if she was any thing to you, and he said not. I never saw her before. I know, from human natur, that she's not used to these things.” “By Jove! you're right, Job; as far as I can gather from what I have heard, and know of her. I'll apprenticeship myself to you some of these days, to learn character.” “Why, Mr. Bradshaw,” said Job, self-complacently; “I've seen all sorts of characters in my day. And I've studied them from a jail-bird to a Governor; but I've seen the most of the worst kind, and it's my candid opinion of the best kind that they're not much to be trusted.” “Job, I believe you're right. Come, my good fellow, and let me see the girl. What kind of a girl is she, Job?” “Why, sir, as I may say, one of the prettiest-looking girls I ever saw. My daughter Lucy thought well of her, and so did my wife; they're acute, quite acute, in understanding woman character.” They now entered the jail. It had a great hall through it, from which a flight of steps ascended to the upper stories. The thick oak floor, the ponderous iron gratings and bars, the handcuffs and chains against the walls, all reminded one forcibly of the locality. On either side of the hall, strong doors led to the apartments of the prisoners. Two doors secured each entrance; one was a grated door, through which those of the prisoners who were suffered to come out in the passage from their wards or cells—which were built on each side of it— could speak with the jailer, or such of their friends as were permitted to see them. There were different cells for solitary confinement, and well furnished rooms for the gentleman debtor who preferred a suite of apartments, and was able to pay for them. Below was the dungeon deep for the irreclaimable malefactor. Job himself led the way to the room in which Jane Durham was confined. As the keys turned in the locks of the passage door, a loud laugh was heard from a room at the other end of the passage. Job and Bradshaw entered the Vol. I. 16 passage, and the careful jailer locked the door after him. When they reached the door of the apartment in which the females were confined, four or five squalid, haggard faces, some still bearing the traces of beauty, appeared at the grate. They gazed at Bradshaw intently, and one of them turned quickly round, and in a tone that Bradshaw overheard, said, “Old Moll, here comes Job with her chap, and he's a gentleman—you'd better mind.” “Let 'em come,” replied a voice within. “Old Moll has had her day, too, and now she goes in for the plunder.” Bradshaw and the jailer entered. There was a fire in a stove in the middle of the room; the air was confined and hot, and of such a noxious and unwholesome nature, that it seemed to have contagion in its very breath. “What have you got your stove so hot for?” exclaimed Job. “Do you want to burn out all your wood in the morning? What do you put your meat in the stove, and leave it there, for? You'll breed a fever!” While Job was speaking, Bradshaw looked round. A woman, whom, at a glance, he recognised to be the one, who, on the previous evening, sprang from the bed at Jane Durham, when he rescued her from Adams, and who was called old Moll, was hastily endeavouring to conceal something under her mattress. On a mattress, beside Moll's, leaning on her arm, with haggard look, and deshevelled hair, stripped of her shawl, bonnet, and gown, and endeavouring to cover her neck and shoulders, with a miserable, dirty and torn blanket, was Jane Durham. Her look of utter destitution and wo struck even old Job forcibly, accustomed as he was to such scenes. “Who did that? Who stripped this young woman?” asked he, in a loud imperative voice, and and with an angry look, that made even old Moll start. “The one that did it's got to be locked up by herself, I can tell you that.” “O! no matter, sir, said Jane Durham;” she is welcome to it all—let her stay here, sir, and keep all—put me for God sake in the cell, and not her. Oh, Mr. Bradshaw! I'm undone—a miserable forlorn and destitute wretch. I sent for you, sir; but I've no claims on you—I've no means. You risked your life for me last night, and knew me not. 'Twas kind in you —the great God will reward you. I'm innocent— I'm innocent of this charge! As sure as there is a holy Providence above us, I am innocent of this charge—but I am, indeed, a miserable wretch.” She fell upon the bed, and hid her head in the blanket. A big tear stood on the iron cheek of old Job, Bradshaw spoke not—he folded his arms, while indignation seemed to predominate in his feelings against Johnson first, and then against the jailer for putting the girl in such a room. But a moment's reflection curbed his anger against Job; and when he saw the tear upon his cheek, he forgot it. Bradshaw knew that the only way to get any favours for the poor girl was to manage Job; and he left his office with the determination to do so. “Job,” said Bradshaw, “that woman Moll has the girl's clothes hid in her bed, there.” “So she has,” said Job. “Mr. Bradshaw, you've a quick eye, sir,” and he advanced to Moll's bed, to take the clothes. Moll, with a face of unblushing effrontery, exclaimed, “They're mine! they're mine!—the hussy stole them from me last night; and—” “You lie!” said Job; and seizing her, led her out of the room to a cell. She made no resistance, as she knew it was of no use. When Job left the room with old Moll in charge, instinctively and without reflection, he locked the door after him. “We've got a man among us what'll happen?” said one of the wretches, with a discordant laugh. The others said nothing, but looked silently at Bradshaw, doubtless with a wish to discover the connexion existing between him and the girl. “Here, Miss Durham,” said he, lifting her shawl and gown from the bed of old Moll, and handing them to her, “arrange your dress; don't be alarmed, you shall be removed from here.” Bradshaw spoke in a soothing tone, and as he laid the shawl and gown on the foot of the bed, he turned away that he might not observe her. The women, wretches as they were, were struck with his delicacy, and an involuntary respect seized them. Old Moll, who had been taken up by the watchman, in the night, while they were in search of Adams, as soon as Jane Durham was locked up with them, took from her her bonnet, shawl, and frock, and began abusing her in the most horrid language, telling the women around, that Jane Durham had come to her house, raised a fuss, and made off with a fellow, after having stolen her dresses and killed one of her friends. Moll made Jane Durham bring her bed, and place it beside her own, and, after taking Jane's bonnet, she amused herself with reviling and tormenting her, much to the gratification of most of the inmates of the room, who took a hellish delight in witnessing the distress of one so young and beautiful, enjoying the anticipation that she would soon be what they were. One or two would have taken the poor girl's part, but for their fear of old Moll—the hag, who was a notorious character, mocking them, if they even looked commiseration, or refused to join in reviling and taunting their prey. We cannot rehearse the scene. Job now returned, opened the door, and, entering the room, said, “Squire, you must pardon me; I am so much in the way of locking the door after me, that I forgot you were in.” “It's no matter, Job; I wished to remain.” And while Jane Durham was hurrying on her dress and looking for her comb, to keep her hair from her face, Bradshaw recounted to Job the events of the previous evening, and all that he knew of her, with regard to Glassman, remarking, “Glassman is away, I don't know where. I shall attend to her case, if he does not; and, Job, you must move her out of this place.” “Yes, that must be done, sir: I hate to lock her up in one of these cells, and I don't know where to put her.” “Job,” said Bradshaw, “you see the girl is young and beautiful, and your knowledge of the world 16* correctly told you at first, that she was not used to these things. She's evidently modest, and any man's daughter may be misled by a man like Glassman.” “Yes, Squire, you're right,” said Job. “I shouldn't ask Mr. Glassman to my house, humble if it be. I have full confidence in Lucy, Squire,— but, Mr. Bradshaw, throw temptation in nobody's way. Glassman's a bit of a rascal, I suspect, if he is a great lawyer. But what shall we do with this poor girl?” “Job, there's no danger of her escaping. Haven't you a room any where, that you could put her in? I'll pay whatever it may cost. Have you no room in your part of the house that would do?” “Why, yes,” said Job, “I've got rooms in my part of the house, as you say—but it's a movement I never made before, and I've been jailer here six years—and then there's my family—my wife.” “Oh! I don't think your wife will object to it, Job.” “Mr. Bradshaw,” said Job, quickly, “I am master in my own house; but still the women have their rights. The girl spoke to my wife and Lucy, and they wanted me to put her somewhere else, and not lock her up here in the common room, but Johnson over-persuaded me. It ain't that I think the girl will hurt my family, but I don't know who she is exactly; and the most knowing men may be mistaken in human natur.” “That's true, Job; but, I hardly think you are mistaken in this case?” “Well, Squire, I don't think I am. Let's take the poor girl out into my office, and I'll see my wife and Lucy, and see what can be done.” The women looked on in amazement, to see old Job show so much feeling. The three left the room. Job, as usual, locked the door, and tried it with great care, and then led the way to his office, where he and Bradshaw left the girl, and proceeded to the part of the jail in which his family were. Jane Durham felt a relief, that almost made her cheerful; she had overheard most of the conversation between Job and Bradshaw; she felt that they took an interest in her, and Bradshaw's kind attention, and his service to her the previous evening, led her to believe that she was not altogether friendless. Bradshaw and Job had scarcely proceeded ten steps, when Job observed,—master, though he boasted himself in his own family,— “Mr. Bradshaw, I wish you would go on and speak to my wife and Lucy about this poor girl. Women have their rights, you know, Mr. Bradshaw? You can explain all of it, to put their minds to rest, as to what she is, and I'll go and bring her along; she has a mighty pleading look, and then, she's monstrous pretty.” “Well,” thought Bradshaw, “this is speedier done than I thought it would be. No bail allowed on a charge of murder? I don't believe she has committed any murder. There's something wrong in Johnson—I'll come across him like a flash of lightning, some of these days, the scoundrel. Better get the girl in Job's family, if I can, than have to manage with Bailley, the magistrate, or have a sitting of the judges on a question of bail. Besides, what bail could she get? there's no bail in murder. If I could manage it, I would have to be bail myself—couldn't be—I've not the property. Besides, if the girl is kept here, and where Job's family can, occasionally, see her, it will have a good effect upon her. I must manage to see Glassman.— There's one thing certain, there'll be all sorts of tales flying all over town about me. Well, let them fly. The girl is most beautiful. The mental agony that she has suffered! There is a sin registered against her betrayer, deep as the mark upon the brow of Cain! Can he be Glassman?” With these and similar reflections, passing like lighting through his mind, much more rapidly than we have recounted them, Bradshaw entered the apartments of Job's family. “Miss Lucy, my jaileress of hearts, how do you do to-day? Where is your mother, and how is she?” “O! Mr. Bradshaw, is that you, sir? Walk in,” exclaimed Lucy, ceasing her occupation of rocking the cradle, in which she appeared mechanically engaged, with her knitting, untouched in her lap. “Mother's well, she's gone up stairs a minute.” “Lucy, what were you thinking about, so earnestly?” “About a poor girl, sir; who was brought in to-day, accused of murder; my heavens! O! she is so beautiful, sir, and so sorrowful. I don't believe she is any more guilty, than that sleeping baby. I never felt so bad before, for any body. Daddy didn't want to put her among the other people— but Johnson, the watchman, insisted it was best. The poor thing, sir, said she knew you.” And Lucy gazed earnestly at Bradshaw. The wife of the jailer, at this moment, entered the room. “Good morning, Mr. Bradshaw,” said she; “I thought I knew your voice. Lucy was telling you about the girl this morning. She said she knew you; (a look, keener than Lucy's, accompanied this remark of the worthy Mrs. Presley.) She's very pretty, and, indeed, I am sorry for her.” Here Bradshaw recounted to the jailer's wife and daughter, in his eloquent and powerful manner, the whole scene of the night; and, also, the situation of Jane Durham in the jail. He told Mrs. Presley that her husband wanted to put her in one of the rooms of their establishment; (here the jailer's wife bridled.) “But,” continued Bradshaw, “your husband and myself thought I had better tell you the circumstances, and ask your advice, and how you felt on the subject.” “Yes,” observed Mrs. Presley, with a smile; “I thought she was wronged when I first saw her.” “So your husband told me, madam,” remarked Bradshaw. “He said that you saw instantly she was a different being from those he locked up. He observed, that women understood women much better than men.” “You may well say that, Mr. Bradshaw. Let me see, there is the room just beside us, that opens into this; we can lock the door that opens into the yard, and she can have that—there's a bed and chairs in it; not so good as she has been used to, may be—but people can't always choose. She can stay there a spell, and if we like her, and there is no objection made, she can put what furniture in it she wants, if she turns out what we think her.” After paying a compliment to their kind feelings, which Mrs. Presley received, consciously, and Lucy, blushingly, Bradshaw left them, to find Job and Jane Durham. As Bradshaw approached the jailer's room, he heard old Job, in a high key, speaking to some one, who, by the voice, he recognised, instantly, to be the lawyer who refused to pay Nancy her fee. “I tell you what it is, Mr. Scrags,” said Job, “the thing can't be done, sir. The man is in for counterfeiting, Mr. Scrags, and he's been in before for robbery—he's a great jail-bird; and it's against human natur, standing as I do, jailer of this establishment, to take the irons off of that man, much less to give him the freedom of the passage without his irons, and no report from the doctor that he's sick, and no word —” “I'll get you word from the sheriff, and be d—d to your human natur, as you call it,” said Scrags, angrily. “Well, Mr. Scrags,” replied the jailer, “you may damn human natur just as much as you choose, it's all one to me; though a man may just say, that if human natur's damned, the whole lot of us is gone, that's all. But, Mr. Scrags, when the order from the sheriff comes, the order is to be thought on. By an act of the session of the general assembly before last, I believe it's in the eighth volume of the statutes,—I know it's in the pamphlet of rules for the government of the jail,—it is enacted and provided, that there shall be trustees appinted to look into the affairs of the jail—and they must look into the affairs of the sheriff, too, with respect to the jail. And—” “Ha! ha! ha!” roared Scrags, half in jest and half in anger. “Job, you had better turn lawyer at once, and commence business. I have no doubt that the whole bar will take you in at consultation, and every litigant will employ you. Ha! ha!— Job Presley, Esq., attorney at law. Ha! ha!— good!” “They might employ a worse man, Mr. Scrags, and not go far,” exclaimed the offended Job. “I have no doubt of it, Job,” said Scrags. “From your intimacy with criminals you've learned the criminal law, and, with rascally debtors, the civil law—hey!” “My manners, sir,” said Job, “if you allude to that, (for with all Job's boasted knowledge of the law, he did not understand the distinction between civil and criminal law,) are just what God gave me, and never put on to serve a purpose; and, as for my criminal information, I got that from the lawyers who come here to get tender mercies showed to their clients—get their legirons off—so that they may give leg-bail to Job Presley some dark night. Then I shall be in the right trim for studying the law, which you advise, Mr. Scrags; as my discharge, as jailer, would leave me nothing to do.” Scrags felt that he was wrong. He was on the eve of damning old Job for a scoundrel, notwithstanding; but he reflected that he might finesse with the jailer some other time,—so he forced a laugh, and departed. Mean while, Bradshaw had entered Job's office, where Jane Durham sat in the corner, with her head bowed down, and her veil drawn over her face. He was about speaking to her, when Job, who had stepped out during his altercation with Scrags, returned. Wiping the perspiration from his forehead, Job remarked— “That Scrags needn't think to circumvent me. He can't do it. Take the irons off of that jail breaking fellow, hey! and give him the liberty of the passage! He'd be off before you could say Jack Robinson; but not before Mr. Scrags had been paid for advising me to take the irons off of him.” “Why, Job,” said Bradshaw, “you came out upon him in style.” “Now, didn't I, Squire? When a man pretends to be a gentleman, why, says I, let him be a gentleman; and when he's a rogue, let him be a rogue. Kitely that died,—the mail robber,— you didn't know him, Mr. Bradshaw, did you?” “Yes—I believe I did,” replied Bradshaw; “a good-looking fellow that died here a year ago.” “The very same,” replied Job. “He died of a putrid fever; and one night, when he was very bad, I watched with him. It was the morning before he died: a man, you know, sometimes seems to get better just afore he dies. Well, I somehow liked him, and I set up with him. It was about midnight. I didn't hear a single chain more in the whole jail. Kitely and I got to talking confidential. He told me he did not think he would live; and, as I'd done a favour to him, he'd tell me something. About a week before he was taken sick, I had taken the irons all off of him, because Scrags asked it, and he complained. What do you think,—it's as true as you set there, Mr. Bradshaw,—Kitely told me that he had given Scrags one thousand dollars to get the irons taken off of him, and to furnish him with a file, and implements to get out. He told me just to move his bed a little, and I could see the hole he had dug, before he got sick. Sure enough, I moved the bed, with him on it, and there was the hole. Laying on the wet earth, that he had crammed in his bed, made him sick. I turned to ask him more questions, when he fumbled at his bed head a minute, and brought out a purse. `I saved this from him,' said he, in a trembling voice, `he got all but this—he was a traitor—he brought a letter into me from a friend—he didn't know what was in it.' Here poor Kitely,” said Job, “had to lay back and gasp for breath: he raised himself upon his arm and went on—`He didn't know what was in it. The letter told me that if I escaped, Scrags had got my friend to promise that he would receive me and secrete me; and when the reward was offered for my apprehension, he was to betray Vol. I. 17 me, and Scrags and him was to share the reward. I sent for Scrags, yesterday, hoping that he would come to see me. If he had, and there had been strength enough in me, I'd stabbed him to the heart.' Them was his very words, Mr. Bradshaw—his very words; and he stretched out his hand, with the purse in it, and he said—`Yes, Job, I've saved this from him,—take it, Job, and give it to your daughter Lucy, the day she gets married, or any day you like. There's no ill luck in it, Job—I came honestly by it, as I am a dying man. Give it to your daughter Lucy, Job—she'll save this jail, as long as she lives in it, from God's curse. Give it to her— I wish it was a million. I heard her persuading you to move me from here, when I was first taken; but I would not be moved, because I'd be discovered. She has sent me every thing to tempt a sick man's palate; and, day by day, she asks me, through my window there, that looks out into the yard, how I am, with a voice that sounds like an angel's.' Yes,” said Job, with deep emotion, “his very words; and he put the puss into my hand, and pressed it, and fell back dead—cold and clammy as the clay under him. But, what was I talking about?” continued Job, rubbing his hand through his hair. “Mr. Bradshaw, did you speak to my wife and Lucy consarning this young woman?” “Yes,” said Bradshaw. “Your wife, Job, likes your idea, and so does Lucy. Miss Durham,” said Bradshaw, addressing her, “I will call and see you this afternoon, when you are more self-possessed. Don't be alarmed: Job will treat you kindly. Make up your mind how much you can tell me of your case. Think over the whole case. Here's Mrs. Presley and Lucy. Good bye.” Jane Durham burst into tears as Bradshaw departed. Lucy and her mother led her to their rooms. Old Job went with Bradshaw to the gate, to let him out. “Mr. Bradshaw,” said Job, “don't tell to any one the case ofpoor Scrags and Kitely, that I told you. I've never told it to mortal man before. It's no use, you know—Scrag's word would be taken before mine; and then, if it was not, who would believe Kitely? Scrags would say. I've felt all unhinged to-day, ever since I saw that poor girl in the room. All at once, it came over me, suppose Lucy should be so placed. It's wrong—I know it's wrong, for a man to have these kind of feelings, like a woman. This is the first time I've had 'em since Kitely died, and that's a year gone.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. When Bradshaw left the jail, he resolved to call, in his way home, at the office of the Squire, Bailley, who committed Jane Durham, and learn from him the testimony against her. The more he saw of her, the more deeply interested he became in her case, and the stronger became his conviction that she was “more sinned against than sinning.” Johnson's conduct satisfied him that there was some foul play. Nancy had observed Johnson's anxiety to commit her to jail—the jailer's account farther proved it; and, connecting this with what Bradshaw, himself, marked in his conduct, when he met him and Fritz, and, also, when standing by the body of the murdered man, he felt convinced that the watchman had a mysterious agency in the affair of the night. For his enmity to himself, Bradshaw could easily account. He had, as we have already observed, severely commented on Johnson's conduct in a certain trial, before a crowded court, and in a manner that one of the watchman's temper could neither forget nor forgive. And then Glassman— Glassman always appeared, in his mind's eye, when he thought of Jane Durham. “I must find Glassman,” thought he: “no one seems to know what has become of him; but I'll speak to the magistrate; and this afternoon I will learn from the girl, herself, the real facts.” The office of the magistrate lay directly in Bradshaw's way to his own office. He entered it, and found him within, seated at his table, behind a railing, constructed for the purpose of keeping the curious crowd at a proper distance from the magisterial person. “Familiarity begets contempt,” says the proverb, of which Mr. Bailley had thought, as well as of the safety of his books and papers, when he ordered the railing to be made. Around the stove, within the railing, were several constables, “cussing and discussing” the police affairs of the day with the representative of justice. The subject of conversation, when Bradshaw entered, was the murder, and the arrest of Jane Durham. Jones, the watchman, whom our readers remember went for the light, when Johnson refused, was saying— “It's a strange kind of a business to me—it's mixed up so that I can neither make head nor tail out of it. Johnson swears here this morning, that when he heard a rumpus in at Dean's he rushed in, and saw the girl give a knife to one of the fellows, and tell him to kill the rascal if he wanted her to think well of him. The fellow took the knife, yet neither of these chaps that's been arrested does Johnson swear to as being the man; but he says he would know the man, if he saw him. Mr. Bradshaw, good morning, sir;”—and Jones advanced to Bradshaw, and they stepped aside. “Jones, how did you come on last night?” inquired Bradshaw. 17* “Badly, Squire, badly,—we went up the lane, to the house you told me of. We couldn't get lights for some time. We found old Moll there drunk, and she said she had none; and when we did get 'em, the wind blew them out; howsomever, we lit 'em again; but by the time we got 'em in again, the bird, if he was there, had put. One of the fellows told me, who is a kind of a half stool pigeon, that he was much hurt; but that he had been carried off. We had to give it up: the murder and the fuss before had made them keen of scent. But we're going to-night, a whole posse of us, to see if we can't catch him.” “I've a great mind to go with you,” said Bradshaw, reflecting that if he did, he might elicit something in the case of Jane Durham. “Squire, you would do us a mighty service, if you only would,” said Jones. “What time do you go?” “Not before eleven o'clock. If they should see us prying about there while they were stirring, they'd pass the word, and we shouldn't see hide nor hair of em.” “But had you not better go in the day time. If he is hurt very much, you may find him stowed away somewhere; or you could, at least, reconnoitre the premises.” “Yes, that's true,” said Jones; “but we know the whole premises; and night's the best time to find 'em, for they'll be drinking and carousing round, and be off their guard.” “Well,” said Bradshaw, “I will go with you.” “Shall we call round at your office, sir?” “No, I'll stop in at the watch-house. Jones, what is the testimony against the girl?” “Why, Squire, bilious, very bilious. Johnson swears that he saw her give a knife to some fellow, —but the fellow's not found.” “Where's the man?” “He's round at D—'s Hotel. We took him there from the watch-house this morning. We found out who he is—his name is Samson Carpenter. He is, they say, from the country.” “He's not dead yet, then?” “He wasn't this morning, sir, though he has never spoken a word. He breathes very hard. He can't stand it long.” Here a watchman entered, and said Carpenter had died. “Where was he hurt?” “A deep gash on the head, sir?” “But is he stabbed?” “I don't know, sir. I just helped to carry him to the watch-house last night, and then I went after that Henry Adams, and left him with Johnson and the rest. The man that was hurt had a friend with him: he appeared here to-day, and gave in his testimony, and, I believe, he had some business he couldn't put off; so he gave security for his appearance, and left town. The court, you know, commences next month.” “Yes. What was his testimony?” The watchman could not say, and Bradshaw turned to the magistrate, to inquire. Mr. Bailley told him little more than he had previously learned. Johnson swore positively, that he saw Jane Durham give the dagger to one of the boys, and make the remark alleged. The friend of Carpenter, whose name was Lowry, the magistrate informed Bradshaw, swore, that a girl at Dean's had quarrelled with Carpenter, and threatened him; but he could not say whether Jane Durham was the girl or not. “And Johnson said,” continued the magistrate, “that old Moll would swear most positively, she saw the girl, Jane Durham, stab Carpenter.” “How can that be,” said Bradshaw, “when Johnson has already sworn that he saw the girl give the knife to one of the boys, expressing the desire that he would kill him?” “Why, Mr. Bradshaw,” said Bailley, “I committed her finally, to await the sitting of the court; I cannot properly hear the case, can I?” Bailley misunderstood Bradshaw's interest in Jane Durham, as did every one, except those to whom he had explained the events of the night, and very naturally. “These things, you know,” said Bradshaw, in answer, “are never very formally done; and if any thing very favourable to the girl should transpire, you would certainly have no objection to hear and act upon it.” A sudden thought struck Bradshaw, and he left the magistrate's hastily, to put it into execution; namely, to ask Job not to let Johnson, the watchman, go to old Moll's cell unaccompanied, for he could not but think, that his evident malice towards himself and the girl, would induce him to prompt old Moll to mischief; which, from what he had seen of her character, and conduct to the girl, he believed would be an easy matter. Bradshaw had scarcely advanced three steps from the door, when he saw before him, coming directly to the magistrate's, Johnson, with old Moll. His first impulse, was to warn Johnson that he was aware of his conduct; but, upon second thought, he resolved to meet him as if he had not the least suspicion of him. Bradshaw stopped until Johnson reached the spot where he stood: when the watchman saw Bradshaw, he started, and seemed anxious to avoid being seen; but he rallied, and said, “Squire, so you know we caught the girl who committed the murder last night. I took her to the jail this morning. Job tells me you got him to be kind to her. If I had known your feelings, I might have treated her better; but here's old Moll, who saw her stab the man.” “Yes,” said old Moll, “you may cut up rowdy tricks in my house, and kill people for her, but you can't save her neck, neither; and if you had killed me, when you shoved me into the corner, you couldn't have saved your own, without her false swearing. But my time's come.” Johnson frowned, and shook his head at the hag, as she spoke. “Yes, my time's come; the day's been when I was better than her; and the day'll be when she's worse than old Moll; ha, ha! What I saw I'll swear to; you'll have to speak hard, to save her, though you have a glib tongue.” Bradshaw said nothing, but followed Moll and Johnson into the Squire's. Old Moll, Bradshaw soon discovered, was intoxicated: Johnson was irresolute. Bradshaw's presence seemed to produce an effect on him which he could not throw off. The magistrate asked him twice what he wanted, before he answered, by saying— “This woman will prove, sir, that the girl you committed this morning, stabbed the man, and—” “Yes,” said old Moll, stepping up to the magistrate, “I'll swear to it, pint blank—hand me the book. I saw her stab the man at Dean's.” The magistrate looked at Bradshaw, inquiringly. “I have no objection,” said Bradshaw; “you may as well examine her—though the girl should be here.” “Moll, you've been drinking,” said the magistrate. “Who gave you drink?” “I gave it to myself,” said Moll. “That's a lie,” said Jones, the watchman, “for when I took you to the jail this morning, you had no money.” “I gave her something to drink,” said Johnson, quickly, “as we came along. May be she had not best be examined. I didn't think 'twould harm her. Shall I take her back, sir?” said he, to the magistrate. “We might as well hear what she has to say,” said Bradshaw, to the magistrate. The greasy Bible, that so many profane lips had kissed, was now presented, perhaps, to the profanest of all. Supporting herself against the railing, with one hand, while with the other she raised the book to her lips, old Moll took the oath, and, with a toss of the head, faced Bradshaw, who had seated himself carelessly by the side of the magistrate, and was, apparently, making unmeaning figures on a sheet of paper with a pen. “Tell what you know about this stabbing, Moll,” said the magistrate. “I know this much about it,” said Moll, “that last night there was a ball at Dean's, and that that girl,—I don't know what her name is,—Jane something, I believe, came there, and got cutting round, and that a strange man, that looked countryfied, asked her to dance, and she wouldn't; and a fuss was raised, and she stabbed him.” “You saw her stab him?” inquired the magistrate. “O, yes, Mr. Bailley,” said Moll, in a tone that was affectedly gentle, “I saw it; you may be sure I saw it, Squire—you know I've sworn to it.” “Mr. Bradshaw, will you ask any questions?” said the magistrate. “A few, sir,” said Bradshaw, “if I have favour enough with Mistress Molly to get an answer;” and, then, in a jesting indifferent tone he put his questions, while he seemed to be figuring on the paper. “What time was this, Molly?” “I can't tell the exact hour. I didn't note the time: may be eleven, may be twelve. I can't say—she did it, that's enough.” “Whom did she go to the ball with?” “I don't know, and I don't care.” “Did you see Johnson there?” “No.—Yes, I believe he was there,” she continued, after glancing at Johnson. “Who went to the ball with you?” “What's that to your business?” she replied. The magistrate told her she must reply properly; and she said, “Sall Sanders.” “Who else?” “Henry Adams,” she replied, after some hesitation. “Where is Henry Adams?” “I don't know;—dead may be. There was more murders than one, that night, I expect.” “Is Henry Adams the man whom I saw in the house with you?” Moll hesitated a long time, and then said— “No.” Bradshaw now asked her a great many indifferent questions; and then carelessly inquired— “How came the girl, Jane Durham, at your house?” “She went there with Sall, Henry Adams, and me,” was the reply. “Henry Adams, then,” remarked Bradshaw, “is the same man that I saw in your house?” “Yes; the same man that you killed—and you ought to be stretched for it.” “Describe the scene when Jane Durham stabbed the man at Dean's.” “I can't describe it: I know nothing about it. I saw her stab him, and that I swear to.” Bradshaw here said, that he had but one more question to ask. “Why did Jane Durham go to your house?” Moll hesitated for a long time, and, at last, said, “After she had stabbed the man, Adams and Sall persuaded her to go to hide from the watch.” As Moll could give no security for her appearance at court, she was remanded to the jail, that she might be forthcoming at the trial. When Johnson and Moll left the room, Bradshaw handed the testimony of Moll, which he had written off, as she gave it in, and requested the magistrate to read it, and see if it was not correct. He read it, and said it was perfectly so. “Then,” said Bradshaw, “be so kind as to sign it, and I will keep it till the trial.” He did so. After being reminded by Jones of their engagement for the night, Bradshaw withdrew. He went in search of Willoughby; told him of the whole case, and remarked, “Willoughby, I know you are fond of adventures. I don't wish to enter this business to-night, without some one with me whom I can trust better than one of these watchmen: I wish you would go with me.” “With all my heart,” replied Willoughby: “I meant to propose it to you, when you first said you were going.” “Which of you enacts Sancho Panza?” asked Cavendish, who was by. “Which of you, I pray? It must be you, Kentuck; and, Bradshaw, here is Don Quixotte, and the lady fair—Glassman's frail lady—is the Dulcinea del Toboso. Well, you'll get your heads broke, in all human probability. Your knight-errantry is devoted, if not elevated— but I forgot the reward! you go halves, I suppose. You put me in mind of an anecdote I have seen of George Selwyn, the celebrated wit: he had a great penchant for the spectacle of an execution, and hearing Vol. I. 18 that several malefactors were to be beheaded in Paris, (the guillotine was not yet invented,) he crossed over, for the purpose of witnessing the scene. On the appointed day, by the favour of the police, he took his station beside the fatal instrument. The executioner, seeing the evident interest he took in the business, supposed him an English gentleman of his own craft; he, therefore, with a profound bow, offered him the bloody axe. `Thank you, my dear sir,” said Selwyn; “I am only an amateur.' If you only go in as amateurs, of course, you cannot expect any part of the reward, but when the true thief-takers give a jollification on the strength of it, you will, of course, attend, as their particular friends.” So speaking, away went Cavendish. “The Judge is an odd fish,” said Willoughby. “To look at his phiz, one would no more expect humour in him, than in the weeping philosopher; but he has it, and loves it as a gourmand does his favourite dish. Yet he has a good deal of sentiment, and is one of the best-hearted fellows I ever knew. Don't you think highly of his talents, Bradshaw?” “Certainly, very. He is fond of the profession; and that is the secret of success in it. He and I were schoolmates here, in town: he was always just such a fellow. He would have all the school laughing; and, in the midst of the merriment, never move a muscle—look as if he wondered what they were laughing at. One day, at a public examination, he fixed the bell-rope to his dog's collar, as the animal lay asleep, and quietly came up stairs, and took his place in his class, looking as if the fate of Cato and of Rome hung upon his solemnity. You know the prinkiness of a public examination: the boys in their best, and the parents and friends looking on so attentively and anxiously. In the midst of it, the bell began to ring vehemently—for the dog, rousing up and finding himself fast, jerked with a vengeance. `There's fire! fire!' exclaimed Cavendish. The whole school took up the chorus, and away he broke, down stairs, the first of all, and let his dog loose, before any one discovered the cause—the boys following after. It has always been a cause of inquiry among the boys, how the bell was rung. Cavendish, with the gravest face imaginable, would enter into the discussion, and wonder if a house could be haunted. I happened to find it out, but have never mentioned it, just that I may allude to the circumstance when some of our old school-mates are by, and watch Cavendish's face. He don't know, to this day, that I know it. Don't you say any thing to him about it; and the next time we are all together, where there are any of our old school-mates, I'll speak of the fact, and do you keep your eye on the Judge. The teacher was a very peculiar man, and a great lover of wit and humour. He had a habit of throwing his hat, which he always wore in school, at a boy, when he misbehaved; and he would make him bring it up, and punish him. One day, he came in school with a new hat. The moment Cavendish saw him, he began to cut a good many pranks: he wanted him to throw his new hat at him. The teacher saw him, and was in the act of hurling it, when he caught himself, and exclaimed—`Cavendish, if my hat was not too good, I would throw it at you.' Cavendish looked at him with a face of the most child-like simplicity, and said—`Throw your head, then, sir.' The old fellow, contrary to what would have been the conduct of most teachers, shook the Judge by the hand, and laughed heartily. They never meet now, but what they have a long chat together. The Judge, too, sometimes acts very oddly, without meaning any jest. He prides himself very much upon being polite in his own house. You know in what an old-fashioned house he lives; the furniture, and every thing around and in it, are in keeping. One day, we had been out riding, and we returned very much fatigued. He insisted upon my staying all night with him, and we retired very early. He conducted me to a large, solemn-looking room, in which was a very large bed, hung round with massive dark curtains, and left me. For some time after I retired, I lay awake, thinking of feudal times, baronial castles, and so forth. I fell asleep with such thoughts. I was awakened by a voice that said, I know not what. Starting up, I beheld a figure at my bed-side, with a light in its hand. In the bewilderment of the moment, I really thought myself in some castle's keep; but I was speedily aware of where I was, by the Judge's apologetic tone. `Bradshaw, my dear friend,' said he, `excuse me: I forgot to ask you if you would have any thing. Are you warm enough?' Just as he spoke, the clock struck two. Mark me—he'll come round to my office this evening, to go, with us, on this `Quixotic expedition,' as he calls it. “Ha! ha! Well, he really is an odd fellow. Do you think he'll go? Bradshaw, suppose we step in here, and take some oysters, and then walk round through the lane, where you were last night. I should like to see the locality.” Bradshaw assented; and, after taking some oysters, by way of dinner, they proceeded to that part of the city. Bradshaw pointed out to Willoughby the place where the body of Carpenter was found; and they passed on, and entered the lane. Here and there might be seen a brick tenement, but the most of the buildings were miserable shanties. The lane was narrow and dirty. In many places the houses were partially under ground, in consequence of the lane having been graded since they were built. A few of the frame ones were of two stories; and as you looked up the lane, the houses on either side reminded you of two rows of militia on their first day of training, who find it impossible to stand in regular file. Here the refuse of the city congregated. It was the common sewer of her outcasts. “You may travel through all Kentuck,” said Willoughby, “and see nothing that reminds you of this, with, perhaps, the exception of one or two places in Louisville. Such looking places always strike me with sadness.” “Fisher Ames says,” remarked Bradshaw, “that a large city is the standing army of ambition.” Throw a community into commotion, and here you may gather mercenaries for any purpose. If mobs do not always originate in these haunts, here, at least, are found the spirits whose similars made France a demoniac democracy, who are fit for any purpose of evil—the worst and for nothing of good.” 18* “Bradshaw,” said Kentuck, “I don't know how you feel about it, but I am morally as well as physically healthier in the country. With my dog and gun roaming through the woods, I feel no headaches, and few of the excitements that lead to vice. In a crowded city, the bustling inhabitants, the news, and rumour of news, the many scenes that attract, the various food for passion, the very noise of the streets, keep one in a perpetual state of excitement; at least one of my temperament, who has lived in calmer scenes. And yet, like a love for the cup, this excitement, which at first may be disagreeable, becomes, after awhile, a pleasure, and at last a want.” They had now passed a considerable way into the lane. “Here I met those two fellows I spoke of,” said Bradshaw, “who scampered off.” As they advanced, they observed several men at the door of a low grocery, eyeing them suspiciously. A woman came out of a house, as if about to cross the street to another: on seeing Bradshaw, she stared at him a moment fiercely, and then turned and entered the door she had just left. Bradshaw thought, though he was not positive, that she was the woman whom he had seen on the bed with old Moll. A drunken man staggered out of the grocery, followed by a woman of the most wretched appearance, who was heaping upon him the most profane curses. The young men at the door of the grocery, after whispering earnestly together, followed after Bradshaw and Willoughby, on the other side of the street. “Bradshaw,” said Kentuck, “those fellows have some mischief in their heads. It always provokes me when I see such rascals eyeing and speaking of one in the way they seem to be. Let's cross over among them, and ask them some questions regarding the rumpus last night. We'll see what metal they're made of.” “That won't do, Kentuck; we'll soon find that they have a kind of metal which we hav'n't—cold steel. I'm not armed the least, are you? Besides, there is no necessity for an altercation with them, and there's no honour in it. I shall appear for the girl, and I don't want to provoke these fellows against me. They were probably at the ball last night, and may be witnesses in this case. Don't you know that the feelings of these wretches are such that, if they were angry with a lawyer, they would as lieve as not swear away the life of his client. No; I must conciliate them, and find out the facts. Many a lawyer loses his case by assuming a hostile attitude towards the opposite witnesses. By the day of trial, I shall know much more of the real facts of this case—and there is something dark in the business—by this course, than I could in any other way. The best place to let the rascals know I've found them out, and to expose them, too, is before the jury. In this way, I may protect the innocent, and hit the evil doers with a vengeance.” The conversation on the opposite side of the street was characteristic. “I wonder who those fellows are?” said one of them—“they've ruffle shirts. Just look at that tall fellow—he shows fight this very minute. By hokey, there's a good deal of strength in him,—he cares for nobody.” “That little fellow,” said another, “is Bradshaw, the lawyer, who pled for Fritz—he's the one who liked to killed Adams last night about a gal. He's a buster—any way you can fix him. He fit his way last night through the lane, with a gal, in spite of the whole of 'em. He knocked Adams down just at a word. He ought to be mobbed.” “Mob who?” said a slim-looking lad, who had left the grocery and joined them, while this conversation took place. He could not be more than seventeen; he had a quick eye, handsome features, with a kind of sailor dandyism about him; a mole skin cap was set jauntily on the side of his head. He was younger than any of those he addressed, and much smaller. “Mob who?” said he; “not Mr. Bradshaw. If you do, Fritz takes the other side.” The persons here stopped, and the one who spoke last turned round and said to Fritz,—“Fritz, I don't believe you're the clear grit, any how.” “Clear grit, or foul grit,” replied Fritz, “he did me a service, when there was nobody to help me. When old Scrags asked me fifty dollars, and I hadn't a cent, he got me off. He went my bail, once, till I was tried, and kept me out of jail; and when my trial came on, he got me off again. Clear off, and I hav'n't paid him a cent for it. If there's any plunder any where, say the word, and I'm with you; but if you cut up any shines on him, I'll blow the whole gang.” “You'll turn state's evidence, will you?” said the fellow, advancing in a threatening manner to Fritz.” “Pete,” said Fritz, looking him steadily in the eye, “hands off! you mus'n't lay the weight of your little finger on me, man, in anger.” “Do you dare me?” said Pete, who was a tall double-fisted fellow, “I could pick you up, tie you in a double beau-knot, and throw you over my shoulder.” “If you can,” said Fritz, “I can let day-light into you as you're doing it.” “Come boys?” said one of the company, “none of this. You will raise a fuss presently, and we had better be looking out for chances. Come, let's go to the balloon ascension,—it's no use to follow after them.” They, accordingly, faced about, and left the lane by the way that Bradshaw and Willoughby entered it. Kentuck and Bradshaw walked on to the other end of the lane; and after standing there a moment, conversing and looking around them, they determined to return through the lane to their offices, that they might understand the place thoroughly— a spirit of adventure actuating the Kentuckian, and a fixed determination to save the girl, and find out the true state of the case, moving Bradshaw. “I begin to feel an interest in this business, Bradshaw,” said Willoughby—“these scoundrels are a caution. I expect that Adams is a leader among them. Such miserable debauchery and villany as theirs is a wonder to me. If a man were a robber-chief, and held the fastnesses of a mountain, or lived as Schiller described his Robbers, or as a free, bold spirit might in the far west, there would be some romance in the life; and the perilous adventure would be in the free air, where exercise would give vigorous health, and renewed energies. But these poor devils here, surrounded by dirt and smoke, and dogs of baliff's, are like a hunted 'coon in a fired woods—they have no fair shake for it. The hollowing, the smoke, the fire, conquers them before they are seen—uses them up at once. The warfare of society upon these spirits, is like that of the savages of the woods against their foes; it hunts them down without mercy. Confound it!—I feel that these things are not right. Yet how can you mend them. Here am I now, coming to-night as I would go to fox hunt, to see a fellow run down— earthed.” “But the fellow deserves it, you must remember, Kentuck,” said Bradshaw; “and if, by leaving him undisturbed, we could be satisfied that he would do no more harm, why, I would rather give him a blessing than a curse, as I left him. But we must protect the weak and the defenceless: this is not only the duty of man, individually, but of society. To feel for such wretches as this Adams, is natural in a generous spirit, for he feels for all. But think of the woman, Kentuck.” “That's a fact! For that reason, I want the fellow caught, and I want to see these characters.” “We don't start before eleven, you know,” said Bradshaw, “and I am engaged to go to the ball. You go, don't you.” “Yes, I'll see you there, and we can both leave together. Mind, Bradshaw, don't miss me. If you do, I will be after you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. Bradshaw had determined to go to the jail in the afternoon, to see Jane Durham and learn from her the facts of the case. But it was wearing late by the time he reached his office, and he entered the court to speak to Nancy of her. “Honey,” said Nancy, “I see ye take an interest for the poor thing. It's right, and ye'll have yer reward. The poor thing is deserving and has been badly treated. I'm old, ye see, Bradshaw, but I've been young, and I know a woman's feelings—yes! I say it in humbleness, a sinful woman's. May be I've been more of a sinner than this young woman—but I've not suffered as much, and there's a merciful Providence for all.” So speaking, Nancy screamed at the top of her voice, after her black girl, Beck, who had strayed away somewhere, and said, “I'll go over and see the poor thing;—and so ye tell me, honey, that Job Presley has been kind to her, and has her out of the jail with his wife. She's a feeling woman, a very feeling woman, and so is her daughter Lucy. Beck, ye hussy, where have ye been? A pretty trollop ye are to be caterwauling about, and leave me to 'tend to every thing. What'll ye come to by such conductions? Here, attend, and none of your fooling around among the fellows. Mind, the big pippins are two for a fip. The frost killed 'most all the fruit this year, and if folks get good fruit, they must pay for it.” With Mary Carlton leaning on his arm, Bradshaw entered the ball-room, following Kentuck, on whose arm leaned Emily Bradshaw. Though Miss Bradshaw's parents were religious, they had little or no objection against their daughters partaking in such amusements. Miss Bradshaw had no fondness for them, but her brother was anxious for her to attend, and the fashionable society in which she was thrown, whenever she visited the city, compelled her to comply with some of its requisitions, or seem very puritanical. She went very little into society, for her extreme delicacy shrunk from its glare; but this very circumstance made her more admired. The hackneyed man of the world, wearied with the flirtations and arts of some fashionable belle, might often be seen with respectful courtesy attending Miss Bradshaw, throwing aside the mere manners of the ton as qualities, which, in this instance, were not most likely to please. Her pale brow, her dark hair, her simple dress, her most winning manners, that wore the impress of the gentlest heart, and the feminine loveliness of her face and figure struck every one. It was an interesting sight to see Miss Carlton and Miss Bradshaw conversing together, the one leaning on the arm of Bradshaw, and the other on that of Willoughby. The tall proud form of the Kentuckian, his expanded chest, his face and head on which nature had stamped her noblest impress, contrasted finely with the delicate being who held his arm. The slender form of Bradshaw, his intellectual head, his penetrating and fiery glance, formed another contrast with the blue laughing eye and fairy figure of Mary Carlton. Standing together and contemplating the dancers, they formed a group that would have interested a painter. The music sounded merrily: Mary Carlton might be seen threading the mazes of the dance to meet her partner, Bradshaw, like a fairy in a labyrinth. There was Henry Selman, dancing with Miss Penelope in high glee; occasionally glancing, with a triumphant air, at Mr. Bates, who was attitudinizing on the confines of the dance. Propped against a pillar—not far off was the judge, with both hands in his pockets, in humorous observation of Bates, looking as if he were contemplating a statue of wo. “Bradshaw,” said the Judge, in the interval of the dance, “I thought you were going a thief-catching, to-night.” “So I am, but only as an amateur, as you say. I don't go until eleven.” “Well, joy go with you; have you told the ladies of your anticipated achievement?” “No, we wait until we have conquered, before we blow the blast of triumph.” “What if you are the conquered? Will you be suffered to leave the lane on your parole of honour?” “I don't know, Judge, we go like the savans in Vol. I. 19 Napoleon's Egyptian army, probably, to be laughed at by the troops, and to be treated with no respect by the barbarians, should we fall into their hands.” “Likely: here comes Kentuck. Willoughby, what time do you commence your possum hunt, to-night?” “About eleven, I believe.” “It's a delightful employment, and so characteristic of a Kentuckian, to go a hunting.” “Oh! Kentucky, The hunters of Kentucky.” “Suppose you should be surrounded, will you die upon the field? or will you tuck up your coattails and heel it—raise a dust in that way? You had better wear roundabouts. `He who fights and runs away,' &amp;c. I've been looking at Bates this half hour. Well, I don't wonder that fellow's thoughts are always dull when I reflect the subject is always himself.” “Why, Judge, you're in spirits to-night, judging from your conversation,” said Willoughby; “but not from your phiz: that always plays possum to your feelings, except when you are sad; and then it gets the spirit of contradiction in it, and looks comic.” “A Kentuckian's phiz,” replied the Judge, “is pretty much like his country.” “How's that?” asked Willoughby. “He has his hair every which way, untouched by the comb or scissors, like his forests, unpruned and free. His forehead is like one of his hills— bluff and bold, and with just as much brains in it. His smile is not like his glorious rivers— “Eternal smiles his emptiness betray, As shallow streams run dimpling all the way.” His chin, when it is shaved, looks like a platter licked clean by a cat. His neck is as open as a prairie. His form's like one of his girdled trees; and his arms are the branches, when tossed by the winds. His cheeks are rich alluvial, where plenty of pork and whisky has been deposited. His manners are those of a bear taught to dance with a chain round his neck, and to grin when his tail is pulled. His oratory is like a north wind roaring through a wilderness. His eye twinkles like a star, but it is not with the borrowed light of any kind of lore, but merely with the pride of a rooster, thinking of his dung-hill.” “Ha! ha! Good,” said Kentuck, “when we consider that I saw this very extemporaneous effusion written off on the back of one of the Judge's briefs, this very day, and blotted all over with emendations.” “Willoughby, that's no such thing,” said the Judge, colouring. “A fact,” said Willoughby, laughing. “And, Judge, carry out your analogies. You're a Virginian, and Virginia is said to be the mother of old Kentuck. If such is the character of the daughter, what of the mother? She, like the mother of the Gracchii, as Calhoun said, when asked for her jewels, may point to her children—but most of her great ones are now gone; and, like all old women, she is now past bearing.” In such jesting, which provoked no anger, the young men whiled the time, until the courtesies of the ball called them off. “Well, Selman,” said Bradshaw, to the admirer of Miss Penelope Perry, “how do you come on in the court of love?” “Why, Bradshaw,” replied Selman, with a delighted smile, “better. I cut Bates out to-night. I don't know why it is, but he is not as attentive to Miss Carlton as he used to be. He directs his whole battery against Miss Penelope, now; but I think he's losing favour—ain't he?” “I think he is. She looks very well to-night.” “O, very. Bradshaw, she won't let me dance with her too often. Do engage her for a set, and keep that Bates away.” “With pleasure.” As Bradshaw advanced towards Miss Penelope, he whispered to Willoughby: “Kentuck, I'm going to engage Miss Penelope for the next set—or will you?—and I'll engage her for the set after. You must dance with her, and help Selman on. We must keep him in good spirits, and make him a beau here, among the fair.” “To be sure. We must row Bates up salt river. I've set the Judge on him, by telling him, which is a fact, that Bates said he looked like the great owl at the menagerie. Bates refused to pay but two dollars at the supper, the other night, because, he said, that was all it was to cost. The breakage cost two dollars a-piece, besides.” “His love for the rhino is hereditary. I'm told that the frail fair one, Catherine P—, pledged a diamond ring to him, the other day, for ten dollars, worth fifty; and he refused to return it, because she did not redeem it at the time stipulated.” “Whew!—the devil! It ain't possible. Bradshaw, I don't believe that.” “Ask the judge. He tells the tale with a holy honour. The girl, I believe, is his client. He swears he'll get the ring.” “Miss Penelope,” said Bradshaw to that lady, “may I have the pleasure of dancing with you the next set?” “If I am not engaged, sir; I promised Mr. Bates, that I would dance with him; and he looks as if he were about to claim my promise.” “Ay, are you such an interpreter of Mr. Bates's looks?” “Not at all, sir; but I wish to keep my promise —at least for my self-respect.” “When did you promise him, Miss Penelope?” “In the beginning of the ball.” “Ay, did he name the set?” “No, sir.” “Then will I cut him out? He has yet not paid his respects to you, to claim the promise. A pretty fellow! If you have only your self-love to gratify in dancing with Mr. Bates, and no other love, allow me to assure you that your best way of gratifying that self-love is to dance with me.” “How so?” asked the lady, laughing. “Because it will be the very way to show Mr. Bates, that you have forgotten a promise, which his self-complacency is indifferent about remembering. Why, you don't know, but that he himself has entirely forgotten it.” 19* Miss Penelope took Bradshaw's arm, and they were soon in the dance. “You seem to enjoy yourself,” said Willoughby, in another part of the room, to Miss Emily Bradshaw. “O! yes, sir, I generally enjoy myself. I see the Babel, without feeling the stir. I mean a very great deal of it. It is really delightful to look round on the happy faces—isn't it?” “It really is; but do you take no note of the sour ones?” “O yes; I observe that they are sour, but I can't interest myself in the mere sourness. I like to watch the contrast. We may see sour faces any where. You know it is said, that the reason so many married couple look so much alike, is because they have looked so long at each other that their features at last acquire a resemblance. If this be true, we should be careful how we take too deep an interest in the feelings of the crab apples of our race.” “I must tell Cavendish of that. He's so fond of contemplating odd people, and strange spectacles, that I must warn him. His face shows already his propensities.” “Yes,—but I don't think it will ever alter his heart.” “No, I don't think it will; though, he gets very cynical, sometimes” “But,” said Bradshaw, “who was passing by, and overheard the remark, “as Goldsmith said of Johnson, all of the bear that the Judge has about him, is the skin.” “Thank you, sir,” said the Judge, who was at his shoulder; “that is an ermine of which I am not ambitious. You valiant gentlemen who go forth on such a glorious expedition to-night, should be equipped in that way. No, I'm wrong—I should not recommend to you the bear's skin, but that which a certain other animal assumed for valiant purposes—the lion's. But you'll be found out.” “How so?” “As he was found out by the bray.” “Ha! ha!—but we can't take you along, Judge, though you are thus equipped.” “Why not?” “Because you'll be found out, without it.” “I understand you, sir,—I'm not only an ass, but the stupidest of the tribe,—hey? Well, I'm not ass enough to go.” Bradshaw passed on, and Cavendish and Willoughby stood beside his sister. “I hav'n't seen you in the dance yet, I believe, Mr. Cavendish,” said Emily Bradshaw. “No, miss, that is an enjoyment in which I seldom join. The fact is, I have a hatred to such skipping about. There must be pleasure in it to some people, of course, or they would not practise it. This jumping up and down, and running to and fro seem to me a relic of barbarism; just as I consider the jewel in Miss Carlton's ear, (I'm glad to see that you do not wear them, Miss Bradshaw,) is a barbaric ornament—the relic of a ruder age. A Shawnee woman, you know, wears one in her nose as well as ears. I don't see why the ears should be complimented in this way, at the expense of the nose.” “The nose, you know, is complimented with specs,” said Miss Bradshaw. “Do you consider the use of specs a barbarous custom?” “No, certainly, we cannot: but I consider them a sorry sight—sorry spectacles. I think a man would almost be justified in making a resolution against wearing them, like Dean Swift. Think of our students, particularly of medicine—why is it that so many of them require specs? It must be for the dignity of the profession. Think of them gaping about through their glasses, like a cat in a gooseberry bush, looking, by moonlight, after a mouse. If there is any thing wanting in the paraphernalia of Mr. Bates, it is a pair of spectacles. Behold him!—he is skipping in the dance, now, like an ape in high health: ten minutes ago, I saw him Byronizing against a column, and looking like many a fellow I have seen at the bar, ruminating on the consequences of sheep-stealing.” “Mr. Cavendish! Mr. Cavendish!” exclaimed Emily Bradshaw, “you'll lose your good name for amiability, if you often speak in this way.” “It will not be the loss of the reputation, if I have it,” said Cavendish, “but your opinion, that I deserve to lose it, that would pain me, Miss Bradshaw. How beautifully Miss Carlton dances!” “Yes,” said Willoughby; “like a sunbeam on a stream—but, Judge, may be Bates is ruminating on the gentlest kind of theft.” “It must be on a petty larceny, sir. The heart that he could steal would not be worth much.” “Kentuck,” said Bradshaw to Willoughby, as another cotillon was forming, “it's half after ten; we should be off.” “That's a fact,” replied Kentuck. “Half after ten! why, by my watch, it is after eleven. What shall we do?” “Suppose we get Cavendish to see Miss Carlton and my sister home, and go.” Willoughby looked blank, and asked, “What about our dresses?” “We can get a rough overcoat at the watch-house, and that will do. Cavendish, you'll see the ladies home for us.” “Why, Bradshaw, I expected to go with you. If you get into a scrape, I don't want you to get your head broke, when I might prevent it by going.” Bradshaw and Willoughby exchanged smiles. They explained to Cavendish that they could not all go; and, after a good deal of trouble with him, he agreed to remain. They made their apologies to the ladies, and departed. They were soon at the watch-house. At the door, they met Jones, with four other watchmen, going upon their mission to catch Adams. A few words were exchanged between them, when the watchmen entered the watch-house, to obtain for Bradshaw and Willoughby the necessary disguises. The watch-house was situated in the centre of the city. It was the house where the watchmen met to receive the orders of the captain of the watch, and to which the rioters and marauders of the night were brought and locked up, to await a hearing before the magistrate, who always attended early in the morning. The room the young men entered was low and long: a dingy lamp of tin hung suspended from the ceiling. Along the walls were benches, permanently fixed, on which lay, at length, or reclined, in any attitude that pleased them, those watchmen who were not on duty. Behind the desk, near a fire-place, was a large, square-shouldered man, with a dread-naught coat on; his cheeks were adorned with an immense pair of whiskers, and through his bushy eyebrows his reddish eye glowed like a cigar in a dark night, in the mouth of some sturdy smoker. This was the captain of the watch. “Lawyer,” said he to Bradshaw, “so you're going a larking to-night. I heard of your business with Adams last night: I wonder, being as you're a small man, that you came off so well. The fellow's a noted gallow's bird, and fights like vengeance. He has sworn he won't be taken alive: you'll have tough times to-night.” “There is no harm in taking him dead, is there?” said Bradshaw. “Not exactly,” said the captain, hesitatingly; “but it would be best to take him alive.” Bradshaw did not mean all that might have been meant by this phrase; but he knew among whom he stood. He remarked, “I have no enmity against the fellow; but he's a great rascal, and he ought to be taken. Jones here has a large family, and is a good watchman, and I want him to get the reward.” So saying, the young men, who had put on dread-naught coats and old hats, and the watchmen departed together. They reconnoitred in the neighbourhood of the alley for some time before they entered it. Several squads of young men, frequenters of the neighbourhood, passed them; but they were much more peaceable than usual; the late transactions having quelled their turbulence. It must have been after one, when they entered the lane. Loose clouds had been floating in the heavens since dark; after midnight, they gathered in huge masses, and the wind began to blow roughly. “What think you of the business, Squire?” said Jones, in a whisper, to Bradshaw, as they approached the house where Bradshaw had contended with Adams: “had we best enter the house?” “Why, Jones, I should ask you; but my opinion is, we had better enter some of these houses. I wish I had a pair of false whiskers on, I could enter then without the least fear of detection, and pass for a watchman, or one of them, as I chose.” Jones inquired of his companions if either of them had a pair of whiskers to spare, and after some explanation, one of them agreed to lend his for the purpose. Bradshaw, accordingly, fitted them on as well as he could, without a glass. It was agreed that the watchmen were to wait in the old frame building, in which Bradshaw had hid with the girl from pursuit, until a signal was given, and Bradshaw and Willoughby were to enter the grocery, and see if they could make any discoveries. “Kentuck,” whispered Bradshaw, as they advanced towards the grocery, “what do you think of this business?” “First rate,” was the reply, “I'm for going the whole hog. Suppose, we turn thief takers, and rival Vidocq or old Hays?” “We will, if we succeed, but remember this is our first attempt. Have you pistols?” “Yes, two of them, and a dirk.” “So have I. Let's have the word Kentuck for our watch-word, and if I hear you call it, or you me, we must come to the rescue. I've no idea of having my profile spoilt, or of being carried out feet foremost; and, therefore, if any of these fellows flash their knives dangerously, it will be worse for them.” The grocery store was a high frame building; on one side of it was a vacant lot, and on the other a frame house not quite so high, and divided from it by an alley of about seven feet in width. Bradshaw and Kentuck entered, and passing up by a counter, they took their station near a stove. Seated by the stove, were two young men, who looked at the new comers, and stretched out their persons so as to take up as much room as possible. The one by Willoughby, put his feet on the only chair that was between them. As soon as Kentuck observed it, he said, “My good fellow, if you'll let your carcass occupy but one chair, I'll take a seat”—and without waiting for the removal—he lifted the chair, let the fellow's leg fall, and sat down. The man stared at Kentuck, who returned his glance with the mildest expression in the world, which the fellow observing, and mistaking for “no fight,” said, “Do you want a fuss here, my young lark?” “Why, I don't much care,” said Kentuck, in a drawling tone. “If there's a fuss, I shall be into it to a certainty; and if there ain't a fuss, I shall sit still. I tell you what it is, stranger, I'm all the way from old Kentuck; you've heard of such a place, may be? It's a place for varmints, wild varmints, I tell you. The word there, is go a-head. You've hearn tell of people licking their weight in wild cats, hain't you? I've seen it done. May be I could do it—should like to try? You've hearn tell of rowing a man up salt river, hain't ye? Well, I've seen it done; there's no joke in it. Did you ever see a man bite the head of a nail off? Bring me one.” While Willoughby spoke this, he stretched his legs out, and looked the man in the face with the most imperturbable indifference. “You're a picture,” said the fellow, struck with his don't-care manner. “Now, ain't I?” said Kentuck. “I'm not one of your pictures to hang round a girl's neck, though: I am a full length painting. One of your pictures that may dangle in a strange kind of frame, some of these days—two posts upright, and one across, with a rope and the picture at the end of it, so well done, that the whole people are admiring the execution. Do you take, stranger?” The fellow nodded, and grinned. “Well, it's no matter—while we live, be merry. What'll you take to drink?” “If you're for drink,” said the fellow, “I'll take a little whisky.” “Ay, of the mountain dew,” said Cavendish. “What's this landlord's name.” “Scratch, they call him.” Vol. I. 20 “Here, Scratch,” called out Willoughby, to an old man by the door, who was keeping a sharp eye upon his moveables—“let's have some of your very best; no deception, old boy, or you'll get scalped, just as a wild Indian scalps a fellow. They learnt the trick to the Kentucks, and we can do it like lightning. I'll bet you a treat, for the company, that I'll take this Kentuck,” (and he thrust his hand into his pocket, and produced a curiously wrought, large knife,) “I'll take this Kentuck, and with one sweep, just one, round your head, I'll leave you, old Scratch, in the condition for a namesake, with no more hair upon your crown, than there is on the back of my hand. What say you?” “Sir, the liquor's good,” said Scratch, “and I want no such experiments.” “Old boy, you'd scarcely feel it. It's a mere circumstance, you'd look just as well with a scratch; and who knows but what you might get a pension by the scalping? But, no matter, if ever you want it done, you must call on me. Stranger,” continued Willoughby, turning to the fellow beside him, “I've been a river character, a wild woods river character; I've seen sawyers, and swamps, and snags, and alligators, and every thing. Why, the sprees you have here, in your lanes and alleys, are nothing to Natchez under the Hill, or the swamps at New Orleans. They'll dirk a fellow there just to keep their hands in. I've seen knives there flash around like sunbeams, and I just set among 'em as I set now and looked on.” “What brings you all the way here?” asked the fellow who had just taken his liquor, and who felt warmed towards Willoughby. “Why, when I was last at New Orleans, I took the sea, round from there, and landed at New York, looked round there a spell, cut up in other places, and at last came here. I happened to get the word, while I was in this here city, that an old comrade of mine had got into hardships somewhere down this way, and I thought I'd just take a look after him.” “What's his name?” “Adams,” replied Willoughby. “Do you know such a man, stranger?” “What, besides Adams, is his name?” “Henry Adams,” said Bradshaw, who observed that Kentuck was at fault. “He's been a high boy in his generation. The word reached us to-day that he'd got into a bad fix. It wasn't to-day, exactly, it reached us, but last night. You see, we took a spree, and got lodged in the watch-house. While they were talking with us, the watchman came in, and told about some fellow having a fight here last night with Adams, and how Adams got hurt—knocked down two or three times about a girl, at a place they called old Moll's. He described the place pretty exact, and I knew it must be in this lane.” As this conversation was going on, the landlord, old Scratch, came round from behind his counter, with a light in his hand, and observed, narrowly, the young men. It occurred to Bradshaw, from the landlord's interest, that, in all probability, Adams was in his premises. The scrutiny seemed to awaken Scratch's suspicion of the new-comers, for he said— “You've got the best kind of tailoring, I see, under them old coats; and they look a good deal like a watchman's. What have you been after?” “Fun, my old roarer,” exclaimed Willoughby, to whom the eye of the landlord had been mostly directed; for, as our readers have observed, he had talked the most, and also exposed his countenance and dress in a manner that made Bradshaw, at first, fear they would be found out. Willoughby's consummate acting, satisfied him there was little danger, and delighted him. “Fun, my old roarer! I can't call you a salt river roarer; though you're not far off of the salt water. I see you're fresh; but do you think a man of my inches wouldn't wear the boot, if best was to be found? As to the getting, that's not your business, my old Scratch. You'd better let me scalp you, and get a good top-knot in place of those rough stubbles you have on your crown. Look at me,” continued Willoughby, slapping his thigh: “do you think I was born with these pants on? Man, just eye them—they're as soft as a girl's cheek. I'd take them off now for a better pair; and why not take off your hair if you can get better? You're now a scratchless Scratch. But keep dark, my old fellow; don't flare your light so much this way. I've some acquaintance in this city that I wouldn't like to see me in your establishment: they'd suspect my respectability.” Scratch took the hint, and replaced his light on the counter, deliberated a moment, and withdrew. He returned, after a short absence, to the back of his shop, and beckoned Bradshaw and Willoughby to him. “What kind of a looking man is this Adams, that you speak of?” inquired Scratch. “He's a thick-set, bull-necked fellow,” said Bradshaw, “with black hair and eyes. He was lately in jail. I went there to see him; but they wouldn't let me in.” Old Scratch hesitated a moment, seemed perplexed, and remarked, unawares— “He says he has known men like you, but none that they call Kentuck.” “My old boy,” said Kentuck, “can't a man change his name, and have what these lawyers call an alias. You don't think a free rover sails always under the same flag, do you?” “No,” said the old fellow, with a grin, “I guess not. But what do you want to see him for?” “To see him for!” exclaimed Willoughby. “The devil! Why, don't you know that the watchmen and constables are after him, hunting high and low?” “Yes,” said Bradshaw, who was satisfied that Adams was in the house; “they'll be down upon you presently, and raise the devil. We want to get him off some where if we can. We heard the watchmen say, the other night, they would turn over every stone in the city for him.” “Blood and thunder!” exclaimed Scratch,— “can't a man do for a friend, without always getting into trouble!” 20* “Scratch,” said Bradshaw, “they'll blow you sky high if they find him; and they'll take him, besides. He's a fellow that'll tell on any body to get himself off. By thunder, I don't want him to tell on me. I want to hide him.” “It will be hard work to move him,” said old Scratch. “He's very bad: he's got his foot twisted all out of place: his head and shoulder is terribly bruised. Come on; let's see if we can't do something for him. Mind, I depend on you as his true friends. You're on no account to reveal the place where you find him.” So speaking, Scratch led the way to the back part of his house, and then, by a ricketty pair of steps, to the second story. His house was uninhabited, save by himself, and those outlaws whom he harboured. All his goods, that were of any value, were in the front part of his shop: they consisted, principally, of liquors, which, together with a few dry goods, and a barrel or two of fish, and some cordage, comprised his stock in trade. The second story had two or three rooms in it, which, as the doors were open, the young men could observe were filled with all kinds of rubbish, of the most inflammable materials. “You see,” said Scratch, chuckling, “they may hunt the hare, but they can't find him. If them dogs of constables press too heavy on me, do you see?—I can just let a candle fall in yon old tar barrel, and if they don't scamper like old rats, what's that to me?” Bradshaw and Cavendish felt in a quandary, as to how they should act, on seeing Adams; but, as they could not communicate with each other, by a tacit understanding, they determined to follow to his hiding-place, and trust to circumstances. The watchmen would, doubtless, keep their station until they heard the signal, or the young men left the grocery. If Adams was much disabled, they could easily take him; but the main point was to prevent the interference of old Scratch and his company, before they could communicate with the watchmen;—however, on went the landlord, and they followed after. He led the way to the corner of the building, next to the vacant lot, beside the tar barrel to which he had pointed, and touching a board, that seemed to be nailed against the wall to repair a dilapidation, a narrow door opened, which led by a ladder to a kind of third story or cock-loft. On entering the apartment, it appeared long and narrow, with the ceiling unplastered and slanting, which was, in fact, formed by the roof of the house. There was no flooring on the rafters, only, here and there, a board laid across in different directions. Treading a board that appeared to lead to the sky-light, the landlord opened a door close to the eves, which they had to stoop to enter, and Bradshaw and Willoughby found themselves in a miserable room, if room it might be called, on the floor of which, on a mattress, lay Adams. The ruffian's encounter with Bradshaw had been no child's play; he looked squalid and feverish. He was so altered from sickness, and his wounds, Bradshaw scarcely knew him. The Kentuckian eyed his broad chest, bony arms, and bull neck, and wondered how Bradshaw could have contended, successfully, with such superior strength. The landlord, with the candle which he held in his hand, lit one which stood by the bed-side of Adams, and then stepped behind the young men. Willoughby had to stoop very much, in consequence of his height, and the lowness of the room. Forgetting, for a moment, this necessity, as he stepped forward, he struck his head against the roof with such force, as to throw him off of his balance. In the impulsive effort to recover himself, he threw out his hand, and struck from the head of Bradshaw the watchman's hat and false whiskers. Snatching a pistol from his bed-head, and aiming it at the head of Bradshaw, Adams exclaimed, in the same instant that he fired—“We're betrayed!” The ball grazed the left temple of Bradshaw, and ploughed its way right over the top of the head of the landlord. The bone of his skull was thick enough to resist its entrance—but it nearly did for him what the Kentuckian offered to do with his knife. Uttering a yell of pain, old Scratch descended the ladder with all possible speed, and fastened the door after him. Bradshaw threw himself upon Adams just as he was cocking another pistol, and he had scarcely time to force his hand in a harmless direction, when he pulled the trigger, but it only snapped. Willoughby sprang upon the body of the ruffian, as he attempted to fire, and said—“I'm the strongest—let me hold him. Run, Bradshaw, and bring the watch.” Quick as thought, Bradshaw hastened down the ladder. He found the door fast: but, placing his body against the wall, and his feet against the door, with main force, after a powerful effort, he burst it open, and tumbled into the room. Within ten feet of him, near the tar barrel, stood old Scratch, with the light in his hand. Bradshaw rushed past him, and descended the steps, into the grocery. There were several persons around the stove, who evidently had been startled by the report of the pistol. Bradshaw looked round to see if there was any back way, through which he could pass out; for he reflected, without his false whiskers and hat, he might be known to some of them, as the one who had hurt Adams. He saw no way of passing out, but by the front door. As he rapidly advanced to do so, the fellow who had been conversing at the stove with Kentuck, asked—“Where's the other fellow? Who fired the pistol? Where's your whiskers and hat, my lark?” “Keep dark,” said Bradshaw; “I left them up stairs. There's watchmen hid away, about here, I believe.” “The devil! What will Adams do? Don't you smell something burning?” At this moment, old Scratch called out from above—“Knock him down—kill him! He's a spy.” The fellows immediately placed themselves in a threatening attitude: one brandished a formidable club, and others drew their knives. They stood directly between Bradshaw and the door, calling out— “Traitor, spy—we know you. Say your prayers!” “Make way, my brave boys,” said Bradshaw, nothing intimidated, drawing and cocking a pistol, as he spoke. “Make a clear passage. Put up your knives and clubs. The first man who attempts to use one, I'll shoot dead.” “Don't fear him,” exclaimed the fellow who had previously spoken: “his pistol's not loaded. Didn't you hear it go off, up stairs?” “Why don't old Scratch come down,” said another fellow, intimidated by Bradshaw's manner, “and help us, if he wants him caught?” “See, boys!” said Bradshaw, producing another pistol, and holding one in each hand,—“two pistols have not been fired: one must be loaded. Your blood be upon your own head! The first one that attempts to stop me is a gone case.” So speaking, he passed deliberately by them, while old Scratch came running down stairs, crying out, “Stop him!” They followed, but at a respectful distance, after Bradshaw, determined to dog him. He crossed over to the old building in which were the watch. He thought it best not to call them, as the fellows might then scamper off; and he wished them to be taken. They followed after him, giving, at intervals, a low whistle, which was answered from the upper part of the lane, where footsteps were heard advancing. All at once, the cry of “Fire! Fire!!” from a hundred tongues, burst forth in that fearful tone, that tells it is near: at the same moment, a blaze of light revealed, to Bradshaw, the forms and faces of the watchmen, among whom he stood. “We've found him,” said Bradshaw. “He's at old Scratch's.” He turned and beheld the old villain's house on fire, with the flames blazing out of the second story windows. It immediately occurred to him, that Scratch had set it on fire; and the rapid progress of the flames was proof enough that his train, of which he spoke, was well set. Bradshaw looked anxiously round for Willoughby, but in vain. He told the watchmen, hastily, the circumstances; and requested them to take Scratch in custody, if they should see him. He then entered the burning house, in search of Willoughby. He proceeded as far as the steps to the second story, but he found it impossible to ascend—the whole was in a blaze; and in places the fire dropped down into the grocery, through the floor, which, in several places, was burned through. He called in a loud voice, stood listening, and called again and again, but there came no answer. By this time, a great crowd had gathered; the bells were ringing; the cry of fire sounded through the city; and the noise of the engine bells and wheels was heard in the lane, as the hose-men ran to and fro, unreeling the hose. When Bradshaw re-entered the street, two engines were in full play on the fire. On the opposite side, he saw old Scratch looking very composedly on the house. Springing forward, and seizing him by the throat, Bradshaw exclaimed, “Where's my friend? Tell me, or I'll choke you? Where's Kentuck?” “In the house,” said the old fellow, doggedly. As Bradshaw was in the act of pressing him to the pavement, he glanced towards the house, saw the trap-door open, and, in a moment after, Willoughby stood on the roof. It seemed to swing and tremble beneath his weight. Stooping down, Willoughby helped Adams through the door, and, half dragging him, for he could not help himself, they reached the chimney that stood near the adjoining house, divided, as we have before described, from it by an alley of about seven feet in width. Luckily for them, the wind blew in the opposite direction, so as to bear the flames towards the vacant lot. The whole of the house on that side was burning; and great bodies of flame broke upward through the very roof at that corner. The engines directed the whole body of the water there, but it seemed inevitable that the two must perish. “Where's the life escape-ladder?” was called out on every side. “Not come yet, not come yet,” was the answer. The crisis was so fearful that the immense crowd looked on in breathless suspense. The firemen worked away at their engines without their accustomed song, in dead silence, with their eyes upturned to Willoughby and Adams. The Kentuckian stood erect, with his arm resting on the top of the chimney; his hat and watchman's cloak he had left in Adams' room: a splendid cable chain of gold was plainly perceptible, over the breast of his mole-skin vest. At his feet, cowering and clinging to the roof, with both his hands, was Adams. His face expressed the wildest horror; in heart-rending tones, he was calling on the crowd for God's sake to save him. As soon as Bradshaw saw Willoughby, he called out to him, in a firm, clear voice, that every man in the crowd heard, “Willoughby! Kentuck! hold on; I'll bring you a rope from the next building.' Willoughby waved his hand. To throw off his coat and boots, catch up a coil of cordage, and enter the adjacent house, were with Bradshaw, but the work of an instant. Several of the crowd said it was no use, as he passed them; and one or two, from the best of motives endeavoured to restrain him, but he rushed on and, in a moment more, he stood on the roof of the next house to the grocery. He put the coil of rope round his neck; with one spring, he lit beside Willoughby; but he would have fallen, had not the Kentuckian caught his hand, for he had to jump on the slanting part of the roof, in consequence of the chimney. The roof cracked and smoked; a cry of horror burst from the crowd. “Here, Kentuck, put this rope round you, and let me let you down,” said Bradshaw. “No, let's put it round this poor devil first,” said Willoughby, “and let him down. I would have dared the risk of jumping on the next roof but I could not leave this man to die, while there was hope.” While they spoke, amidst the breathless silence of the crowd, they tied the rope round Adams and lowered him down in safety. Willoughby wrapped the rope round the chimney, made it fast, and said— “Now, Bradshaw, do you descend.” “Not until you are first down,” said Bradshaw. Willoughby folded his arms, and looked a Bradshaw. Vol. I. 21 “No, Kentuck,” said Bradshaw, “I got you into this difficulty. You're making the peril greater for both of us by waiting. Go a-head!” “Come on!” called out the crowd, “come on! the roof is falling!” The Kentuckian still paused; Bradshaw sprang upon the next building, as the only means of making him take the rope. As Bradshaw leaped, Willoughby seized the rope: scarcely had it felt his weight, when the roof fell in with a tremendous crash. The crowd thought for a moment that both were lost. But, when the roof fell, the chimney stood; and Willoughby clung to the rope, and held himself suspended, for an instant, by an admirable presence of mind, in air, till the smoke somewhat subsided; and, while the flames were yet smothered under the roof, he let himself down in safety. By almost a miracle, Bradshaw, when he jumped on to the next house, maintained his footing. This he could not have done, had he not been in his stocking feet. If the Kentuckian had tried it, he must have fallen, booted as he was. “is he safe?” called out Bradshaw. “Is Kentuck safe?” “Safe as an old 'coon!” exclaimed Willoughby; “how are you, Bradshaw?” At the name of Bradshaw, the crowd huzzaed loudly. The deep silence—the fearful suspense— that had held them awed, was now broken, and they shouted again and again. Bradshaw felt a thrill of real pleasure as he looked down on the sea of heads, and saw so many approving faces upturned towards him, and the many from the house-tops and windows. It gave him greater pleasure, though, when he heard the crowd below huzzaing for Kentuck. Adams, overjoyed at his deliverance from the fiery death, had, though in the custody of the watchman, told the crowd around of Kentuck's generous risk for him; while, in no measured terms, he was denouncing old Scratch, who had disappeared. The miserable male and female tenants of the lane gathered round Kentuck, who was endeavouring to find his way to Bradshaw, in wonderment and admiration; and, strange to tell, his gold chain hung untouched round his neck. The first person that Bradshaw met, when he descended, was Fritz, with his boots and coat in his hand. “Mr. Bradshaw,” said Fritz, “I just got here when you threw off your coat and boots; a fellow was making off with them, when I stopped him. When I saw you on the top of that house, sir, I thought you wouldn't need 'em.” “Fritz, my good fellow,” said Bradshaw, “you and I have both learned that, to be in danger, is not always to be hurt. A miss is as good as a mile, you know.” “That's a fact,” said Fritz, smiling, knowingly. “Fritz, I want to see you, particularly. You must call at my office as soon as you can.” The boy promised to do so. As Bradshaw was passing through the crowd, he met, at the same instant, Willoughby and the Judge. “You're pretty specimens of human nature,” said the Judge, who evidently was much moved, but who appeared very cynical; “pretty specimens of human nature, to disguise yourselves to catch a poor devil, that you may, perhaps, hang him; and, when you've caught him, to risk your lives to save him. Bradshaw, you showed some feeling, if not sense, in trying to save Willoughby, but as for the Damon and Pythias friendship between Willoughby and this Adams,—I can't understand it. To stand on a house-top, beside a felon, whom you have caught, when you had no business to catch him; and because he can't get off, to burn with him, is a luminous idea! There's nothing like it, except that of a Hindoo widow burning on the funeral pile of her husband. And that's not like it; for she burns according to law, and the law must be respected. How much a Kentuckian's understanding is like an Irishman's, to be standing up there in such a theatrical position—`Get up,' said a watchman, to Pat, `the house is on fire.' `An', by hokey, what do I care?' said Pat, `go till the landlord—I'm only a lodger.' And you, Bradshaw, after you had jumped on the house to let that Adams down, first; and then to stand parleying with a Kentuckian as to who should descend! A Kentuckian, who, if he could get a crowd to look at him, would take Sam Patch's leap any time, or ascend in a balloon for the sake of the claps he'd get. It is preposterous, by Jove! I picked up the biggest brick-bat I could find, and hurled it at you with real vengeance!” They had, by this time, reached the outskirts of the crowd. “Whose hack is that?” shouted the Judge, to a hackman, who was driving. “A gentleman sent a boy to our stable for it, just now, sir,” said the hackman. “He ordered it here.” “'Twas I,” said the Judge. “That Jackson has hacks, to be got at all hours, night and day: it's a great convenience. Here, boy,” giving a boy some silver, “you've been quick. Bradshaw, get in; you look feverish, now. As soon as I saw you safe—I knew you must have pitched your clothes any where—so, to prevent you and Willoughby being taken for madmen, or the inmates of these places, burnt out, without clothing, and roaming in search of it, I sent a boy round for a hack. You're pretty spectacles, Willoughby— parading a gold chain—it's lucky it wasn't stolen: his friendship for Adams saved it—and a ball-room dress, in these haunts, to catch a rogue. He looks like that mad tragedian, that came into the court, the other day, and cut up his antics. A sixty dollar suit for such a purpose!—there's your vanity again! I suppose you wanted to shine out before the Desdemonas of the lane. I saw a whole crowd of women after Kentuck, like, I wont say what. It's a marvel you were not knocked in the head. Bradshaw, I wonder you had not more sense, than to go on such an expedition, in a gentleman's dress. Whose old coat is that, and where's your hat? You'll catch some cutaneous disease from that rascally garment, that will last you for life.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">21* CHAPTER XV. The next morning, Bradshaw awoke with a violent pain in his arm, occasioned by the manner in which Willoughby seized it, when he jumped on the burning roof beside him. He had also caught a violent cold, which was accompanied with a severe fever. Willoughby and Cavendish went to see him in the morning, and found him in bed, ill, and getting worse. They determined not to send for a physician there, but to see Miss Bradshaw, who was staying at Mrs. Holliday's with Miss Carlton, and inform her of the circumstance. As soon as Mrs. Holliday heard of it, she insisted that Bradshaw should be removed to her house, where his sister might attend him. This was too agreeable to the affection of Miss Bradshaw, for her to make any objection, other than to express a fear of the trouble it would give. Mary Carlton smiled at that. “You know, Emily,” she said, “he is very patient: I have helped you to nurse him before. Besides, I know he will soon be well enough to sit up and talk; and then a whole host of beaux will be coming to see him. I will see him, if he's sick; and who'll want to be trolloping to a boarding-house? No—he must come here.” In half an hour, Miss Carlton and Miss Bradshaw stood by Clinton's bed-side, at Mr. Holliday's. The speedy administration of medicine, by a skilful physician, broke the fever the second day after his confinement; and he was able to sit up, though his arm was terribly swollen. “And, so,” said Miss Carlton, entering his room with a newspaper in her hand, “Mr. Clinton Bradshaw, you're a perfect hero—listen.” So speaking, she read a full account of Bradshaw's adventure in the lane, when he rescued Jane Durham from Adams; and, also, a narrative of the events of the fire: Willoughby's noble conduct, and Bradshaw's aid, at the imminent risk of his own life. High compliments were paid to Willoughby, for the risk he ran to save the life of Adams, whose real character was told. Speaking of Bradshaw, in conclusion, the paper stated the fact, that when the multitude heard the name of him who so daringly saved the life of his friend, they greeted him with loud and long huzzas. “This tribute of applause,” continued the editor, “Mr. Bradshaw, though a very young man, who has not yet commenced the practice of the law, except in the criminal court, has often received, for his great talents and splendid eloquence in the assemblies of the people. We are happy to know that it was given, in this instance, to the impulses of a heart that is as brave and magnanimous, as his genius is commanding.” This was from one of the first editors in the country, who never paid an undeserved compliment. Miss Carlton attempted to read it in a mock-heroic strain, but, before she got to the conclusion, she threw down the paper and ran out of the room, to hide her emotion. She soon returned, with a piece of fancy work in her hand; and, seating herself on the sofa, very busily engaged herself with it, for a few minutes. At last, throwing back her curls, but without looking at Bradshaw, she asked— “Who is this `beautiful creature' that the paper speaks of, Clinton?” “A client of mine, Mary; and, you know, we must keep the secrets of our clients.” “You make great pretence to mystery, sir.” “Not a particle. I scarcely know more of her than the paper speaks of.” “She is very pretty—is she?” “Beautiful.” “Can she, can she be a murderess?” “I think not, Mary; there's a mystery in the case, which I can't unravel.” Here the servant entered, and said, there was an old woman at the door, who wanted to see Mr. Bradshaw. “Who is she?” asked Bradshaw. “The old woman, who sells cakes at the court-house,” was the reply. Bradshaw desired the servant to ask her in. Nancy entered in her best habiliments. Her cap was crimped with puritanical precision, and a black silk dress of the finest, graced her person. It was made after the ancient fashion, with pockets, and the plaits in it were very carefully folded. Nancy made a courtesy to Miss Carlton, and advancing to Bradshaw, she exclaimed, “Well, Bradshaw,” (our readers have already observed, that Nancy seldom said Mister,) “honey, I'm glad to see ye; I sent Beck to inquire after ye, and I come myself, yesterday, and the day before—but, I wouldn't have ye disturbed—I only wanted to know how ye were.” “Thank you, Nancy, I am getting better; I heard you were so kind as to call and ask after me. Nancy, this lady is Miss Carlton, daughter of Mr. Carlton, who lives next to my father's. I believe you didn't see her when you were at my father's.” “No, I did not, but I heard tell of her. Honey, ye're a bonnie lassie, as my first husband used to say. I remember yer mother, well. Ye're like her, but ye have better health. I knew ye were not a Bradshaw; they have dark hair and eyes. Bradshaw, honey, I've been this morn to see the girl, Jane Durham. She's sore distressed, on occasion of yer being hurt and sick; ye mus'n't fail to do your best, in her case.” “Have you heard any thing more, Nancy?” “Nothing more, honey. I just stopped this noon, at the jail, to see how things come on, and to have a little talk with my old gossip, Mrs. Presley. There I saw Jane Durham: she had heard of yer being hurt, the day after it happened, by the watchman, who brought Adams to jail. I promised to send her word how ye were, by my Beck. She's a forlorn, poor girl, my dear,” continued Nancy, turning to Miss Carlton, “but she's an injured woman, and she has a woman's feelings. Ye're rich, my dear, and ye have friends, and ye stand high in the world. Ye have all that wealth can buy. Ye can never know—no, it is not in God's providence; I hope it is not—that ye should ever know the deep sorrow that has entered this young woman's heart. Yet, why may ye not?— why may ye not? Ye are beautiful: so is she. Ye are rich: she is poor—yet, riches may fly from us like thistles on the wind, and then friends go; and any thing's a shelter that keeps rain and snow out. Though we are sheltered, what can keep us from sorrow? Honey, I don't speak to ye to hurt ye, dear. No! if ye have not one sorrow, ye must have another—for none of God's creatures are free. Them that ye have not, honey, ye can feel for; and I see that ye do: I see it in yer bright blue eye. If Bradshaw should be forgetting of this poor girl, ye must remind him, dear. She's no murderess—she's no murderess. So, dear,” continued Nancy, after a pause, looking fondly at Miss Carlton—“ye're no Bradshaw, but ye and he have been brought up together. I bethought me, at first, that ye could not be brother and sister—I've seen Bradshaw's sister, and a sweet one she is; but ye two may be nearer and dearer: ye may be a Bradshaw yet.” So speaking; and telling Bradshaw that she would call and see him, and bring him some fine fruit, when the doctor would let him eat it, Nancy bid him “good bye.” Miss Carlton, in great confusion, without glancing at Bradshaw, left the room with Nancy, to show her to the door. “A Bradshaw, yet!” exclaimed Bradshaw, rising and walking hurriedly up and down the room; “that would be as sweet as satisfied ambition. But ambition must be satisfied first; no, not satisfied; but I must be on the course, leading, and the goal in view, before that crowning joy can be. Can it be, though I were?—she is so young, so beautiful, so rich,—suiters will press around her with every art that man can practise. I must meet a dozen Richmonds in the field, and, perchance, have to contend against her father. What cares she for me, but as a sister cares? She showed emotion, in reading that newspaper praise; so would my sister show just such emotion—'tis natural— we have lived together since our childhood. I have pressed her lip, and held her tiny hand in playfulness, before I knew what passion was, or dreamed of it—and thus, in her innocence, she feels now. Now, I cannot keep the fire from my lip, when I press hers. She does not think of me as a lover. Yet, by heaven, if her heart is unengaged, Mr. Clinton Bradshaw, you have a tongue, and why not seek to win her? I have every opportunity—I feel that I have an influence over her; but it is, perchance, but brotherly. And, if I have the opportunity, is it manly, to win her with her splendid dower, and in her glorious beauty, and I nothing to throw into the other scale, but this frail form, that she may love? No, no, no, Clinton Bradshaw; this genius—this commanding genius, if you have it, that this puffing paragraph talks of, must control men first, and win the high places.” He walked up and down the room rapidly, while his flushed cheek and burning brow showed the fever had not subsided. “Yes, yes, I must win the high places first. Bah! who would throw away ambition? Wolsey thought not of the advice till he had lost all. In this free land, thank God, we have no kingly power to damp our aspirations. All may aspire. Be blessings on republicanism! None can hold back the spirit, in this land, that men would honour. But,” said he, pausing before the glass, “must every little circumstance touch my health? O, that I had Willoughby's body, to endure! He looks as fresh this morning as a May day breaking. Will I last, will I last in this toilsome way before me? By heaven! while I, from very sickness, must lie upon the road-side, with feeble pulse and drooping head, some one, whom I left in the dim distance, may pass me. Well, well,” said he, throwing himself on the sofa, “sometimes I think, perhaps, 'tis in my better moments, that I might wed Mary, and live upon the Purchase, and let my days glide on, like the stream before our door. Under my old patriarchal oaks! Yes! I could live in peace, if Mary were by my side—as peacefully, as contentedly, as happily as I lived in my childhood, when each other's presence was joy enough.” Pursuing these reflections, he leaned on the stand, beside him, and wrote the following STANZAS—TO MARY. I've thought, in many a dreaming hour, If I could win the voice of fame— The wreath without a fading flower, That gathers round a glorious name— That come what might, I should be blest; The gay, the fair, might take the rest. That woman's smile should but attract, Like music at the gorgeous play,— Given between each passing act, To while the tedious time away: That when the scene employed my care, I'd heed not how she went, nor where. Even as the boy who takes the bird, And loves to mark its panting breast, And breathes it many a pretty word, And gives it all that birds love best: With woman thus I thought to play, Then wearied, let her flee away. That wish for fame is but a dream, Which only in my dreams can live; And could I realize the theme, What could its frail possession give? The bird, alas! her notes I've heard; O! that I now could win the bird. She should my every thought engage, 'Twould be my joy to hear her sing; I'd keep her in a willing cage, And of my heart I'd make the string: Then lady-bird we could not part, But with a seared and broken heart. “No, no,” said he, pushing the stand from him; “I've the blues from loss of blood and pain. This is namby pamby speculation. I must go-ahead.” Pursuing such reflections, Bradshaw wrapped himself up in his cloak, and fell asleep on the sofa. After Nancy left Mrs. Holliday's, Mary Carlton (she was alone, Miss Bradshaw having gone out to get some little delicacy for her brother) hurried to her chamber, and sat at the window gazing out into the street, where her thoughts Vol. I. 22 were not for an hour. Her eye was animated, and her colour went and came, though she sat alone, at the course of her own thoughts. She buried her face in her hands, while her rich curls fell over them, and mused, and smiled, and wept, and blushed, by turns. She seemed irresolute what to do. Bradshaw, she thought, might want something, and she ought to go and see. She hesitated, and at last, with a noiseless step, opened his door, and saw him asleep on the sofa. Stepping to the stand, she beheld “Stanzas to Mary,” in Bradshaw's handwriting. She read them hurriedly, picked them up, put them down, gazed on the manly brow of Bradshaw, so calm in sleep, the eye closed like a weapon sheathed, and quickly replacing the paper with scrupulous exactness, but with a trembling hand, in the very spot she found it, she left the room, with timid step and fluttering heart, cautiously closing the door after her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. The day after the incident recorded in the last chapter, Bradshaw had recovered, with the exception of a painful arm, which he was obliged to wear in a sling. He had not yet left the house, when the following note was handed to him. To Clinton Bradshaw, Esq. Sir—In honour of your intrepid conduct, displayed at the fire in — lane, on Tuesday evening last, and in respect for your talents and character, we have the high gratification, as a committee in behalf of the fire companies of our city, to invite you to a public dinner, to be given at the City Hotel, at such a time as your health will permit: of which please apprize us. Permit us to hope that your rapid restoration will give us the honour of meeting you at the social board very soon. We are, sir, with sentiments of the highest respect, Yours, truly, Watson Johnson, Joseph Clooney, Jonathan Cavendish, William Scott, Henry Selman, Bird Pleasants, Com'tee. Willoughby was also invited. In his note accepting the invitation, Bradshaw mentioned the following Monday, as the day when his health would allow him to attend. On Monday, a sumptuous dinner was, accordingly, served up, in an immense hall, which was crowded. Bradshaw had the post of honour, and beside him sat Willoughby. When the cloth was removed, Bradshaw was toasted in a highly flattering manner, and received with three cheers, when he rose to return his thanks. His remarks were admirably calculated to produce effect. His language and thoughts were felicitous, and every word was seconded by the voice and the eye. They cheered him over and over again, as he spoke, while his powers, like every true orator's, gathered and glowed till there was not an unmoved heart in the assembly. A true orator can make any subject, where you touch his feelings, of deep interest to his audience. He complimented Willoughby in the happiest manner, and said—“he deserves all the honours of this occasion: he risked his life, to save one whom he could have no motive to save, but the promptings of a heart, that could not let the most lowly, and the most unworthy suffer. I acted,” continued Bradshaw, “to save him who possessed these noble qualities of which I have just spoken, who is an ornament, and an honour to society, and who, from a love of adventure, and from a friendly regard to myself, was thrown into danger. None could have blamed him, if he had left Adams to his fate—it was a fate, which all would have said the ruffian merited. But I—I—had I not exerted myself for the rescue of my friend—and under these circumstances, I would have deserved, ay, richly deserved, the fiery death which he escaped. When Willoughby was toasted, in noticing the remark of Bradshaw, he said—“My friend, to whom I owe the deep debt of gratitude for my life and who, if his life had been lost in attempting to save mine, would have fallen, as though a star, which had newly risen above the horizon, with a glorious track before it, and with men's eyes upon it, in wonder and admiration, had become suddenly extinct, has been pleased to say, I deserved the honours of this occasion. Now, ain't this a pretty story?—when if he had not been there, I could not possibly have been here.” During Bradshaw's confinement, Mr. Shaffer had been appointed state's attorney, in which capacity it was his duty, to prefer the indictment to the grand jury against criminals, and to appear in behalf of the state at their trial. The court was soon to set, and Bradshaw, was anxious to know what would be done in Jane Durham's case. She had not yet, of course, been indicted; but he was satisfied that Johnson would do all in his power to have a bill found; and he was desirous that it should not be done, until he knew more of the case— had spoken with her on the subject, and had heard something of Glassman. Before the fire, he had inquired several times for Glassman among his acquaintance, and the answer was, he had heard town; but Bradshaw could not learn where he had gone. Twice he had been to Glassman's house to inquire, but he found it shut up, and he rapped in 22* vain at the door—no servant came. Glassman was a man of such erratic habits, that his disappearance for a day or two was scarcely noticed, but by those who had intrusted business to him, and who feared that he was neglecting it. He was not habitually intemperate, but he took too frequently what is called a “frolic,” or “spree,” during which, for days together, he would plunge into every excess, which was sometimes followed by severe indisposition. The day of the public dinner was the first that Bradshaw had left the house since the fire; and when the company broke up, he walked round to Glassman's office, in the hope of hearing something of him. On the rapper of the door of the dwelling part of the house, he saw a napkin tied; and he hesitated, at this sign of sickness within, whether he should rap or not. While he stood in perplexity, he saw Mr. Shaffer, the new state's attorney, passing; and joining him, he inquired if he could tell him any thing of Glassman. “Mr. Bradshaw, my respects to you, sir,” said Mr. Shaffer, in his formal, but courteous manner. “I understand, my young friend, that you have been doing yourself great honour lately; honour at the fire, sir, and honour to-day at the dinner, which has been given to you. You deserve it, sir, and I understand that there was a very large assemblage who were very much pleased; an evidence of a popularity, which I have no doubt will increase. You ask me, sir, for Mr. Glassman. Mr. Bradshaw, there, is a man of great talents, who, like the sun in a cloudy day, has scarcely given a glimpse of the brilliancy which he possesses—his vices, sir, have obscured what should have been a most brilliant career. Sir, Mr. Glassman, as I have just been informed, (for I had some business with him, and I have been inquiring for him for this last week,) is just out of the hospital, sir, where he has been, to use the vulgar expression, as crazy as a bed-bug, from a fit of intemperance. His friends, sir, don't want this publicly known, and they have been trying all they can to conceal it; but, sir, I may mention it to you. It is melancholy. Every young man should reflect upon it. Glassman is now better—he was brought home this morning. He is still quite ill, his nerves are in such a state, that his physician has deemed it proper to forbid his being seen. Is your business urgent, my young friend? come, this is my office, you know. Walk in.” Bradshaw accepted the invitation, and entered Mr. Shaffer's office. After they were seated, he congratulated the old gentleman on his appointment, and said, “I shall obtain more fees, Mr. Shaffer, and lose more cases.” “Ha! ha! Mr. Bradshaw. You compliment me, sir. But, as I'm getting old, I must occasionally get you to assist me, when some stern case comes up. I see you rescued a girl from that notorious scoundrel, Adams, the other evening. She is accused of murder, I'm told, sir. Since, too, you have caught Adams. Well, sir, that was a bold stroke. He is one of the greatest offenders, and most determined ruffians, I ever knew.” Bradshaw thought this a fit opportunity to speak to Mr. Shaffer of Jane Durham, and he accordingly narrated to him the whole circumstances; observing,—“Though, Mr. Shaffer, you are the attorney for the state, I feel no delicacy in mentioning this to you. My object is not to get a fee, but to have justice done. The girl I do not believe is guilty—my suspicions rest elsewhere.” “Well, sir, I will look into the case particularly. I think I have some talent at ferreting out a bad cause.” After a few common-place observations, Bradshaw took his departure, and went over to the jail. “Mr. Bradshaw,” said Job, “I missed you sorely. I wanted to ax you on several pints of law that I've been disputing upon with them magistrates that come here. I tell 'em it may turn out that Job Presley knows more of the law than they think for.” “Oh! Mr. Bradshaw, you're good for weak eyes,” exclaimed Mrs. Presley, as Bradshaw entered her apartment; while Lucy rose to hand him a chair. “I'm a sight,” said Bradshaw to Lucy, “which I suspect your eyes, Lucy, will not soon require, then. Where's my fair client?” “She has, just this moment, gone into her room, sir. She was wishing very much to see you,” replied Lucy. “How do you like her?” “Oh! very much, indeed, sir. She helps mammy and I, at our sewing, or she sits and reads to us. We don't believe one word that's said against her. Will you walk in? Here she is, sir.” Bradshaw, accordingly, entered the room, and Lucy left it, closing the door after her. Jane Durham showed great joy at seeing him, and after, with many tears, expressing her deep sorrow for the trouble she had given him, and for the great risk which he had run on her account, she told him she would narrate to him—if he could spare time to listen—all that she knew of Adams, and how she came in the lane; protesting, at the same time, that she was entirely guiltless of murder. “I am a guilty creature,” she said, “but no murderess, no murderess! But there is a curse on me, it may be, that demands my life. Yes, a curse, a curse—Oh! how have I fallen! how have I fallen!” she burst into tears. “Calm yourself, Jane,” said Bradshaw, in a soothing voice; “why exaggerate your errors into crimes? You let your imagination brood too much on the events of the lane; one, possessed of your sensibility, never can see her situation, when there is any difficulty in it, in a proper point of view. Unfortunate circumstances may place any one in, apparently, the most desperate difficulty; but, remember, that the darkest night is often succeeded by the brightest day.” “Mr. Bradshaw, you don't remember me?” said Jane Durham, in a more cheerful tone. “No, I do not remember you,” said Bradshaw, “but it strikes me forcibly, that I ought to remember you—that I have seen you somewhere. Where was it?” “I have been your schoolmate,” replied she, with a deep blush. We must be about the same age. Don't you remember Jane Durham, who used to go to Mr. Lusby's? pretty Jane, they used to call me. It may be, that the vanity engendered in my heart, then, ruined me.” “Bless me, yes,” said Bradshaw, “I remember you. Pretty Jane! I remember you well; we must, as you say, be about the same age. We were about twelve, when we were schoolmates?” “Yes, sir, near that age. My father hired a small farm from Mr. Carlton; we lived, just before you get to the school-house, on the left hand side, you know, after you passed the Branch. You frequently used to stop at my father's, as you went to school, and ask, if “pretty Jane” had gone yet. I was just twelve, when my father moved away from the neighbourhood of the Purchase, and went to Long Swamp to live, near the third turnpike gate, a little this side of the village they call, Fair View.” “I felt that I had seen you somewhere,” said Bradshaw, “and that I ought to know you. Pretty Jane! how often you have sung for me! Do you remember it? Why, we have paddled in the Branch together, after many a pretty pebble. Well, Jane, I am glad I came through the alley that night: be assured, that I will exert myself all I can in your case.” “O! I know you will, sir; I know you will. As soon as I heard the watchman mention your name, by the dead man, I thought it must be Mr. David Bradshaw's son. I had heard of you often. Mr. Glassman talks a great deal of you. And when I came to inquire of aunt Nancy, I knew you must be the same.” She mused a moment, and then continued, in a sorrowful strain—“My father is dead, you know, sir. He died shockingly, shockingly! My mother! my mother! she's dead now, too—I have an uncle living in Pennsylvania; he's all the kin I have on earth. Believe me, I have tried to resist degradation and shame—I have tried as the weak bird tries to resist the net of the fowler. Mr. Bradshaw, indeed, I have been unfortunately, miserably situated. Whom have I had to guide, to advise, to shield, to protect me? My father—it is not wronging even the dead, to say it— was no father to me; and my mother! she meant well, generally, but she was weak and easily deceived. We lived comparatively happy, while we were on Mr. Carlton's place; my father, intemperate as you know he was, even then, was still within some bounds—the good examples round him, in some measure restrained him, and, at times, we had hopes that he would do better. How fondly, even then, a child, with all my apparent giddiness, I nursed the hope!—After some low debauch, in which he would abuse my mother and myself, often turning us out in the cold nights, into the woods, where, in the leaves, we have slept, or lain down with the beasts in their wretched shed, have we crept towards the house in the morning early, and appeared to be busy about it, at our work, to prevent the neighbours from suspecting our situation. Sometimes, after one of these miserable nights, he would come out and call us in, and ask my mother, in a kind tone, for his breakfast: then, partly from remorse, and partly from the shattered state of his nerves, he would weep, declare how much he loved us, and say, this should be the last time we should be so treated. Oh! with what watchful anxiety would my mother and I try to keep him from drink. We would sit by him, together, for hours, and try to talk cheerfully, and, as if nothing had happened,—if mother had to go away, to attend to the cows, or get wool to card, I would sit by him, child as I was, and try to amuse him. If he wanted tobacco—and often, after one of these scenes, and while he yet felt ashamed of it, he would say he wanted it, as an excuse to go to the grocery, on the road, and drink—as soon as he expressed the wish, I would insist upon going, and, in the dark night, on the lonely road, I have hastened off to get it, while mother would try to amuse him till I returned. At last, when, as he often would, he avowed his purposes, and said he didn't want tobacco, he wanted drink, mother would persuade him to let me go and buy it for him, hoping that, by keeping him at home, we might restrain him within some bounds, or, at least, hide the vice from our neighbours, which we could not prevent; he would say he had no money, and he must go himself to get credit; mother would then produce her last cent, which we had obtained for carding or knitting, and send me. Alas! for what good? The neighbours knew it long before we dreamed they knew it. And when the drink was brought to him at home, he would get crazy on it, drive mother and myself, in the middle of the night, into the woods, lock the house, and threaten our lives, if we dared to return to it. These scenes, which were not unfrequent, even when we lived on Mr. Carlton's place, became, I might almost say, of daily occurrence, when we moved to Long Swamp. At the Swamp, we were miserably situated—we lived in an old log house, off of the road, but within sight of the village and the grocery. We had no comforts—comforts! we often wanted bread. My mother's health grew worse and worse from the unhealthy situation. My father never brought a cent into the house, and often, with threats and the most horrible curses, extorted from my mother the few she had, that were to buy us bread for the only meal we had in the twenty-four hours. In winter, we had no wood; while my mother has been shivering in her wretched bed, with an old blanket for a covering, and the wind whistling through the logs on her, I have cowered over a few coals in our desolate hearth, and at every noise I heard, started up and looked between the logs, through which you might have put your fist, out on the old fields, in which our cabin was situated, with the fear and dread of seeing my father staggering over the heath, muttering curses on us, as he came. Oh!” exclaimed she, clasping her hands together, “this was heaven to what I have known. One day, I remember it now, as I felt the superstition then that it was ominous, one cold winter's day, I sat by our lonely hearth, and thought it would not be wrong to pray to Heaven, that, in returning from the village, my father might never be permitted to enter the house again. I started at a noise I heard without, while a conviction of the wickedness of my own thoughts struck me with Vol. I. 23 terrible dread. I looked through the logs, and beheld my father, who was so drunk, that he could not walk alone, staggering towards the house, supported by a man whom I did not know then, but who was Adams.” Here a gentle tap was heard at Jane Durham's door, and Lucy Presley entered and said, “That her mammy had got supper; and wouldn't Mr. Bradshaw come and take a cup of tea with them.” “With great pleasure, Lucy,” said Bradshaw. “Come, Jane,” said Lucy, in a kind tone, to Jane Durham: and they were soon seated round Mrs. Presley's table. The jailer's wife and Lucy had arranged every thing in apple-pie order, in honour of Bradshaw. There were several kinds of preserves; bread of the whitest; toast of Lucy's making, and biscuits spread out on a table-cloth white as snow. The tea—Nancy had often proclaimed that Mrs. Presley made as good a dish of tea as any body need taste—would have made Dr. Johnson take his thirteenth cup. The jailer's wife bustled around; and officiously, with her apron, wiped off a chair, and handed it to Bradshaw. She had dressed herself in her best cap— while old Job had put on a clean shirt and cravat, with a fine broadcloth coat, that he had had for years, and which he only wore on extraordinary occasions. Much as Job liked Bradshaw before, and he had often been heard to say, pointing to him, that that young lawyer was going to take the rag off the bush, at that bar; yet his rescue of Jane Durham from Adams, which he had heard from the girl herself—his conduct at the fire, and the talk which it had made about town—the dinner, and Bradshaw's speech, of which Job, who had been in the city, had heard great accounts, all combined to raise him higher in the jailer's admiration than any other man had ever stood. Job brought the newspaper home that gave an account of the fire, and of Bradshaw and Willoughby, and read it with great unction to his wife and Lucy. “There,” said he, “what did I always tell you about Squire Bradshaw, from the first time I set eyes upon him! What did I tell you? every body's found it out now—there it is in print—I guess they know, too, that old Job Presley knows something about human natur.— When a man's done a thing, any body can say he did it; but it isn't every body that can foretell that he could do it—that's the pint”—said Job, as he finished reading the article in the paper—getting, not without great difficulty, over some of the longest words, which he attributed to his bad eyesight, as he wiped his spectacles— “that's the pint. I can read human natur, just as I read that paper—better! I can read human natur without specks. There, daughter Lucy, put that paper away. Mr. Bradshaw 'ill be in more papers 'an that, 'afore the sod's on him, if Job Presley knows any thing.” At supper, Job questioned Bradshaw, over and over again, of the manner in which they managed old Scratch, and took Adams. He laughed loud and long at the narrative Bradshaw, who told a tale well, gave of Willoughby's conversation with the fellow at Scratch's. Time slipped away unobserved by Bradshaw, as he sat conversing with the jailer and his wife, daughter, and Jane Durham. Not feeling very well, for the excitement of the day had given him a violent headach, he arose, and telling Jane Durham, he would call over and see her again soon, he bid them good night, and left the jail.

The letters were selected from among several hundred, as most fit for publication. Every one of them is strongly characteristic. They are made up of excellent instructions to his relative, respecting personal conduct and the culture of his mind; philosophical remarks; accounts of his own situation and feelings; notices of his acquaintance, &amp;c.” —National Gazette. “The letters now published exhibit many amiable traits of private character, and show how keenly he suffered from his own overwrought sensibilities. They abound in evidences of good feeling, and good sense. As specimens of epistolary style, they may be safely consulted; while, as furnishing a closer insight into the views and habits of a man who was misunderstood by many, and whose history is part of the history of his country, they should be read by all.” —Daily Chronicle. CHARLES THE FIRST. Memoirs of the Court of King Charles the First. By Lucy Aikin. In two vols. 8vo. “The admirers of Charles the First, owe no gratitude to Miss Aikin. She has told too plain a tale. She has given, it is true, no summary of the character of that monarch, but she has devoted an extensive work to a faithful relation of his public works and actions, and has left it to tell its story.” —Athenœum. “Following up her interesting career of an historical writer, Lucy Aikin has here produced one of those episodes belonging to our national annals, which add to the importance of facts elaborated from many a source, all the charms which are usually found in the inventions of fiction. “Suffice it to say, that from family and other papers long hidden from the public view, new lights are ever and anon shed upon the actors and proceedings of that time; and that without delving too deeply into them, our intelligent author has wrought the whole into one of those agreeable narratives for which her pen is so justly popular.” —Lit. Gazette. PENCIL SKETCHES, OR OUTLINES OF CHARACTER AND MANNERS. BY MISS LESLIE. “Look here upon this picture, and on this.” —Shakspeare. Contents.—The Escorted Lady. A Pic-Nic at the Sea-Shore. The Miss Vanlears. Country Lodgings. Sociable Visiting. Frank Finlay. The Travelling Tin-man. Mrs. Washington Potts. Uncle Philip. The Revolutionary Officer. Poland and Liberty. The Duchess and Sancho. The Clean Face. Lady Jane Grey. In one volume, 12mo. “Miss Leslie hits, skilfully and hard, the follies, foibles, and exceptionable manners of our meridian. She is perhaps too severe; she draws too broadly, but she is always more or less entertaining, and conveys salutary lessons even in her strongest caricatures. Her subjects, incidents, and persons, are happily chosen for her purposes.” —National Gazette. THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE-DAME. BY VICTOR HUGO. With a Sketch of the Life and Writings of the Author, by Frederick Shoberl. In 2 vols. 12mo. “Victor Hugo is a most powerful writer—a man of splendid genius, and gigantic grasp of mind.” —Court Journal. ROOKWOOD—A ROMANCE. BY W. HARRISON AINSWORTH. From the second London edition. In 2 vols. 12mo. “This is one of the most spirited and romantic of `the season's' production. Full of life and fire, it excites the reader and carries him onward— much as the true heroine of the tale, the mare Black Bess, does the true hero of it, the robber Turpin—with mingled sensations of terror and delight. It is a wild story, told with exceeding skill, and wrought up to the highest pitch of which so singular a subject is capable.—The book is an excellent one, and the author may take a high station among the romance writers of our time.” —New Monthly Magazine. VATHEK.—AN ORIENTAL TALE. BY MR. BECKFORD, AUTHOR OF ITALY, &amp;c. “A very remarkable performance. It continues in possession of all the celebrity it once commanded.” —Quarterly Review, 1834. THE MAGDALEN AND OTHER TALES. By Sheridan Knowles, Author of The Wife, Hunchback, &amp;c. In 1 volume, 18mo. THE INSURGENTS. An Historical Tale. In 2 volumes, 12mo.

AURUNGZEBE; A TALE OF ALRASCHID. An Eastern Tale. In 2 volumes 12mo. THE CANTERBURY TALES. BY SOPHIA AND HARRIET LEE. “There are fine things in the `The Canterbury Tales.' Nothing of Scott's is finer than `The German Tale.' I admired it when a boy, and have continued to like what I did then. This, I remember, particularly affected me.” —Lord Byron. “To read the Canterbury Tales of the Misses Lee once more, is a species of temporary regeneration. There is scarcely any educated person of this century who has not, at some time or other, of youth, drawn a sincere pleasure from these pages. The different tales have been to many like turning down a leaf in life; we can find our place again in juvenile existence by the associations connected with them. The Officer's Tale, perhaps, was read on some sunny bank in a pleasant land--a stolen pleasure. The Young Lady's Tale unfolded all its intricacy on some fair sofa of a well remembered apartment. On the German Tale perhaps two hearts beat in unison trembled in harmony, and, when sharing a mutual agitation, two heads bent over the mystic page, they turned round to see each other's fright reflected in well known and well-loved features. Even now we feel a shiver running over the frame, us we call to mind the fearful whisper of the name of Kruitzner amidst the silent throng of a kneeling congregation in the cathedral. Such a memoria technica has its charm; and we may be pardoned for approaching this number of `The Standard Novels' with feelings of far more interest than we take up any new novel of the day.” —Spectator. THE MAYOR OF WIND GAP. BY THE AUTHOR OF THE O'HARA TALES. MY COUSIN NICHOLAS. 2 Vols. LEGENDS OF THE LIBRARY AT LILIES. BY THE LORD AND LADY THERE. In 2 vols. 12mo. “Two delightful volumes, various, graceful, with the pathos exquisitely relieved by gaiety; and the romantic legend well contrasted by the lively sketch from actual existence.” —Literary Gazette. “The author of these volumes merits much higher praise than most of the pretenders to the palm of genius.” —Balt. American. FRANKENSTEIN, OR, THE MODERN PROMETHEUS. BY MRS. SHELLEY. In 2 volumes, 12mo. “The romance of a child of genius.' —Canning. “One of those original conceptions that take hold of the public mind at once and for ever.” —Moore's Life of Byron. “Certainly one of the most original works that ever proceeded from a female pen.” —Literary Gazette. “This work will be universally acceptable.” —Atlas. “Perhaps there is no modern invention which has taken more thorough hold of the popular imagination than Frankenstein.” —Spectator. WILL WATCH, OR THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A NAVAL OFFICER. BY THE AUTHOR OF CAVENDISH, &amp;c. 3 vols. 12mo. THE PRINCESS. BY LADY MORGAN, AUTHOR OF FLORENCE MACARTHY O'DONNELL, &amp;c. 2 vols. 12mo.

Paul de Kock, Author of Andrew the Savoyard, &amp;c. In 2 vols. 12mo. “De Kock is quite unrivalled in his sketches of Parisian society. There is much character and spirit thrown into the translation, and the dialogues are excellent.” —Lit. Gazette. “A good translation of a clever work. Paul de Kock paints to the life the bourgeois of Paris.” —Athenœum. “We cannot withhold our applause of the subtle spirit of fun, the fine dramatic tact, and the natural portraiture of character.” —Atlas. THE WONDROUS TALE OF ALROY. THE RISE OF ISKANDER. BY D'ISRAELI, AUTHOR OF VIVIAN GREY, THE YOUNG DUKE, CONTARINI FLEMING, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. TWO VOLUMES, 12mo. LOVE AND PRIDE. A NOVEL.

AUTHOR OF “SKETCHES OF IRISH CHARACTER,” &amp;c. In 2 vols. 12mo. From the 3d London edition. “This work belongs to the historic school; but it has that talent which bestows its own attraction on whatever subject its peculiar taste may select.” —Lit. Gazette. “An admirable historical romance, full of interest, and with many new views of character. The plot is extremely well conceived, very artful and progressing, the story never flags, and you open at once upon the main interest.” —New Monthly Magazine. TYLNEY HALL—A NOVEL. By Thomas Hood, Author of the “Comic Annual,” &amp;c. In 2 vols. 12mo. “At last, after having been on the look-out for this long promised novel, with much such impatience as the schoolboy watches for the cuckoo, who remaining unseen, still keeps him in quest of her, by uttering some tantalizing note close in his neighbourhood. At last, we have fairly laid hold of this Will o' the Wisp of a book, the first of its kind, but we hope not the last.” —Athenæum. CALAVAR; OR THE KNIGHT OF THE CONQUEST. BY DR. BIRD. 2 VOLS. 12mo. NEW GIL BLAS, OR, PEDRO OF PENAFLOR. BY R. D. INGLIS, AUTHOR OF SPAIN IN 1830. IN 2 VOLS. 12mo. “The whole work is very amusing.” —Literary Gazette. “Those who want a few hours of pleasant reading are not likely to meet with a book more to their taste.” —Athenœum. “The labor and power, as well as knowledge, displayed—the `New Gil Blas' deserves to stand forth to the public view with every advantage. We have read these volumes with great delight.” —Metropolitan. EBEN ERSKINE, OR, THE TRAVELLER. BY JOHN GALT, AUTHOR OF LAWRIE TODD, ENTAIL, &amp;c. IN 2 VOLS. 12mo. “A clever and intelligent author. There is a quaint humor and observance of character in his novels, that interest me very much; and when he chooses to be pathetic, he fools one to his bent; for, I assure you, the `Entail' beguiled me of some portion of watery humors, yclept tears, albeit unused to the melting mood. He has a sly caustic humor that is very amusing.” —Lord Byron to Lady Blessington. “One of the remarkable characteristics of Galt, is to be found in the rare power he possesses of giving such an appearance of actual truth to his narrative, as induces the reader to doubt whether that which he is perusing, under the name of a novel, be not rather a statement of amusing facts, than invented story.” ROSINE LAVAL, BY MR. SMITH. An American Novel. In 1 volume, 12mo. “The perusal of a few pages of the work must impress every reader with the opinion that the writer is no ordinary person.” —Nat. Gazette. “His pages abound with passages of vigor and beauty, with much fund for abstract thought; and with groups of incidents which not only fix attention of the reader, but awake his admiration.” —Phil. Gazette. “It is one of the most pleasing, chaste, and spirited productions that have met with for a long time. We may claim it with pride as an American production.” —Balt. Gazette. CECIL HYDE.—a novel. in 2 vols. 12mo. “This is a new `Pelham.' It is altogether a novel of manners, and paints with truth, and a lively, sketchy spirit, the panorama of fashionable life —Atlas. THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF JACK KETCH. IN ONE VOL. WITH PLATES THE LIBRARY OF ROMANCE, WHICH CONSISTS OF A SERIES OF ORIGINAL TALES, NOVELS, AND OTHER WORKS OF FICTION, BY THE MOST EMINENT WRITERS OF THE AGE, AND EDITED BY Leitch Ritchie, Esq. Vol. I. THE GHOST-HUNTER AND HIS FAMILY, by Mr. Banim, author of the O'Hara Tales, is universally acknowledged to be the most talented and extraordinary work that has issued from the press for many years. “Mr. Banim has put forth all the vigor that belongs to the old O'Hara Tales, and avoided the weakness that sullied his subsequent efforts.” —Athenœum. “There is more tenderness, more delicacy shown in the development of female character, than we have ever before met with in the works of this powerful novelist. “Banim never conceived a character more finely than the young Ghost-Hunter, Morris Brady. It is a bold and striking outline.” —Author of Eugene Aram. Vol. VIII. WALDEMAR, A TALE OF THE THIRTY YEARS' WAR. BY W. H. HARRISON, AUTHOR OF TALES OF A PHYSICIAN, &amp;c. Vol. II. SCHINDERHANNES, THE ROBBER OF THE RHINE, BY THE EDITOR. “It is long since we have met with so bold, spirited, and original a story.” —Literary Gazette. “We now once more recommend the work itself, and the series, of which it is a worthy volume, to the public.” —Athenœum “Decidedly one of the best romances we have ever read.” —Court Journal. “Mr. Ritchie's Tales sometimes amount to the sublime, either in the terrible exigency or the melting pathos of the event, or in the picturesque energy of the description.—Schinderhannes may be esteemed as the best work of fiction for which we are indebted to his pen.” —Atlas. Vol. III. WALTHAM, A NOVEL. “Certain we are that very few of our modern novels can produce a character more admirably drawn than that of Murdock Macara, and Johnson the quondam tutor; Mr. Bolton and Hulson are sketches that no one but a man of talent could have conceived, and none but a master could have filled up.” — London Monthly Magazine. “It is a publication of no ordinary merit, is written with considerable power, and embodies a story of deep interest. The Library of Romance has already an extensive circulation, and deserves still greater. “The numbers published thus far, are devoted to works of the best description, and are calculated to entertain without offending a single moral precept.” —Penn. Inquirer. “There are some fine passages, and touches of strong descriptive powers of nature and characters.” —Balt. Amer. Vol. IV. THE STOLEN CHILD, A TALE OF THE TOWN, BY JOHN GALT. “The auto-biography in this volume is equal to Mr. Galt's best days, and even his subordinate characters are worthy to be recorded in the Annals of the Parish.” —Athenœum. “The Stolen Child is a most cleverly managed story. “We do not think any one ever exceeded Mr. Galt in sketching national portraits—they are preserved as if for a museum of natural curiosities.” — Lit. Gaz. “A story of considerable interest.” —Balt. Gazette. Vol. V. THE BONDMAN, A TALE OF THE TIMES OF WAT TYLER. “A very picturesque and interesting story, and laid during a period which well deserves illustration.” —Lit. Gaz. “One of those stirring narrations that give a picture of the times, and take along the reader with the events, as if he was indeed a part of what he read. This series of romances has thus far maintained its character for novelty and raciness, and while the whole is worthy of especial commendation, each number is in itself a complete story.” —U. S. Gazette. “The narrative embraces one of the most interesting periods of English history, and is full of life and spirit. The character of Wat Tyler is well depicted.” —Balt. Gazette. Vol. VI. THE SLAVE-KING, FROM THE “BUG-JARGAL” OF VICTOR HUGO. “In this abridged tale from Victor Hugo, may the readers of wonderful incidents `woo terror to delight' them. The attention is aroused, and maintained to a frenzied state of excitement anxious to be satisfied with similar details.” —Am. Sentinel. Vol. VII. TALES OF THE CARAVANSERAI. THE KHAN'S TALE. BY J. B. FRAZIER. Cooper's New Novel. THE HEADSMAN, A New Novel, by the Author of the Spy, Pilot, &amp;c. In 2 vols. 12mo. THE PARSON'S DAUGHTER. BY THEODORE HOOK, AUTHOR OF SAYINGS AND DOINGS, &amp;c. IN 2 VOLS. 12mo. “We proceed to assure the reader, who has it before him, that he will enjoy an intellectual treat of no mean order. The principal feature of its excellence is an all-engrossing interest, which interest is mainly attributable to the extreme vraisemblance of its incidents, and the fidelity with which each character supports its individuality. In it there is as much invention and originality as we have ever met with in a modern novel, be the author who he may.” —Metropolitan. “The moral of the tale carries conviction as to the justness of its applicability, and the incidents flow as naturally as the stream of events in every-day life.” —Ibid. “Here is a novel from a deservedly popular author, written with great ease and sprightliness.” —Athenœum. SWALLOW BARN, OR, A SOJOURN IN THE OLD DOMINION. In 2 vols. 12mo. “We cannot but predict a warm reception of this work among all persons who have not lost their relish for nature and probability, as well as all those who can properly estimate the beauties of simplicity in thought and expression.” —New York Mirror. “One of the cleverest of the last publications written on this or the other side of the Atlantic.” —New York Courier and Enquirer. “The style is admirable, and the sketches of character, men, and scenery, so fresh and agreeable, that we cannot help feeling that they are drawn from nature.” THE DOMINIE'S LEGACY, Consisting of a Series of Tales illustrative of the Scenery and Manners of Scotland. In 2 vols. 12mo. “These pages are pictures from scenes whose impress of truth tells that the author has taken them as an eye-witness; and many are rich in quiet, simple pathos, which is evidently his forte.” —Literary Gazette. GALE MIDDLETON, A Novel, by Horace Smith, Author of Brambletye House, &amp;c. In 2 vols. 12mo. TREVALYAN, A Novel, by the Author of Marriage in High Life. In 2 vols. DELORAINE, A Novel, in 2 Vols. BY W. GODWIN, AUTHOR OF CALEB WILLIAMS, &amp;c. &amp;c. “We always regarded the novels of Godwin as grand productions. No one ever more forcibly portrayed the workings of the mind, whether it were in its joyous hilarity of happiness, or in the sublime agonies of despair. His tales, if we may so express it, have each but one character, and one end; but that character, how all-absorbing in interest, and how vividly depicted; and that end, how consistent with its preliminaries, how satisfactory, and how beautiful!” —Metropolitan. FORTUNES OF PERKIN WARBECK.—a romance. BY MRS. SHELLEY, AUTHOR OF FRANKENSTEIN, &amp;c. &amp;c. 2 VOLS. 12mo. “We must content ourselves by commending the good use our fair author has made of her materiel, which she has invested with the grace and existence of her own poetical imagination. The character of Monia is a conception as original as it is exquisite.” —Lit. Gazette. “The author of Frankestein has made a romance of great and enduring interest. We recommend Perkin Warbeck to the public attention. It cannot fail to interest as a novel, while it may impart useful instruction as a history.” —Com. Advertiser. ASMODEUS AT LARGE, A FICTION. BY BULWER, AUTHOR OF PELHAM, EUGENE ARAM, &amp;c. “This is another admirable production from the prolific pen of Mr. Bulwer— distinguished by the same profundity of thought and matchless humor which are so happily combined in all his writings.” —Baltimore Weekly Messenger. “Our readers have felt that the impassioned pen of the author of Eugene Aram has not lost its power in these sketches.” —N. Y. American. Miss Austen's Novels, Complete. EMMA, A Novel, by Miss Austen, 2 vols. SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, 2 vols. MANSFIELD PARK, 2 vols. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, 2 vols. NORTHANGER ABBEY, 2 vols. PERSUASION, 2 vols. “There are few works of fiction, so acceptable in republication as the Novels of Miss Austen. “They never weary, their interest is never lost, for, as in the prints of Hogarth, we find fresh matter for admiration upon every renewal of our acquaintance. In her works the scene is before us with all the reality of the world, and, free from the engrossment of acting a part in it, we discover points of interest which a divided attention had overlooked. “Her merit considered, her perfection in one style, Miss Austen is the worst appreciated Novelist of her time. The Quarterly Review, (to its honor be it remembered,) was the first critical authority which did justice to her merits, and that after the grave closed over her unconscious and modest genius. “It is remarkable that Scott, who noticed with praise many inferior authors, never mentioned Miss Austen.” —Examiner. LIGHTS AND SHADOWS OF GERMAN LIFE. In 2 Vols. 12mo. “The pictures here given of German life have an interest which to us is perfectly irresistible.” —Sunday Times. “The work under our notice has great claims to the consideration of every reader who likes good tales, in which he will find every thing in keeping.” — Metropolitan. “These most original stories are replete with incidents, scenes, and characters that will dwell upon the mind they have amused; some of them have the conciseness, wit, and satirical point, of Voltaire's sparkling romance, but without their mockery of all that is sacred and virtuous. We rise from their perusal with our hearts warmed for our fellow-men, and with our love and interest increased for this world.” —Court Magazine. THE LAST MAN. BY MRS. SHELLEY, AUTHOR OF FRANKENSTEIN, &amp;c. 2 VOLS. 12mo. DELAWARE, OR, THE RUINED FAMILY. A Novel, in 2 Vols. 12mo. “Delaware is a work of talent in every sense of the word. The plot is full of interest, the characters are sketched with vitality and vigor, and the style is neat and flowing throughout.” —Edinburgh Evening Post. “Delaware is a tale of much amusement and interest. We heartily commend it to our readers as a very pleasant and very clever work.” —Lit. Gazette. “Delaware is an original novel by an able man.” —Spectator. “The story is well told, the characters clearly unfolded, and the conclusion natural and satisfactory.” —Athenœum. LONDON NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENTS, OR, TALES AND CONFESSIONS. By Leitch Ritchie, Author of Schinderhannes, &amp;c. In 2 Vols. 12mo. “This work is supposed by eminent critics to be the chef-d'œuvre of the author.” “Mr. Ritchie is by far our best writer of romantic and imaginative tales,” was the dictum of the Literary Gazette—and the Atlas pronounces him “the Scott of the short, picturesque, and bold story.” “The power of fascinating the reader, of chaining him down, as it were, while his fancy is tormented by terrible imaginings, is the principal characteristic of Mr. Leitch Ritchie's pictures.” —London Weekly Review. THE REPEALERS. A Novel. By the Countess of Blessington. In 2 Vols. 12mo. “The Irish scenes are entitled to warm commendation, they are written with equal good feeling and good sense; while Grace Cassidy is a sweet and touching portrait.” &amp;c. &amp;c. —Lit. Gazette. LITTERATURE FRANCAISE. BIBLIOTHEQUE CHOISIE DE LITTERATURE FRANCAISE. SELECT LIBRARY OF MODERN FRENCH LITERATURE. In 4 volumes, 12mo: containing— LES ECORCHEURS. CINQ MARS. PARIS ET LES PARISIENS. MEMOIRES D'UN APOTHECAIRE. HEURES DU SOIR, LES ENFANS D'EDOUARD. MINUIT ET MIDE, &amp;c. &amp;c. Some of these works may be had separately. THE DOOMED. A NOVEL. In two volumes, 12mo. AYESHA, THE MAID OF KARS. BY MORIER, AUTHOR OF ZOHRAB, &amp;c. 2 VOLS. 12mo. THE SUMMER FETE. A POEM, WITH SONGS. By Thomas Moore, Esq. Author of Irish Melodies, &amp;c. “The description of the Fete is in easy, graceful, flowing verse, and the songs with which it is interspersed are, unlike many of those which that gifted poet has published, unexceptionable in their moral tendency.” —N. Y. Commercial Advertiser. “Many of the songs interspersed are pretty and pleasing, and savor of the usual richness of sentiment and luxuriance of style habitual to Moore. We can willingly recommend the work to all ladies, and lovers of good poetry.” —American Sentinel. MEN AND MANNERS IN AMERICA. By Major Hamilton, Author of Cyril Thornton, &amp;c. 2 vols. 12mo. CHITTY'S MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE. A valuable work for Lawyers or Physicians. In royal 8vo. THREE YEARS IN THE PACIFIC, including notices of Brazil, Chili, Bolivia, and Peru. In one vol. By an Officer of the United States' Navy. “The work embraces copious descriptions of the countries visited; graphic accounts of the state of society; brief notices of the history, state of the arts, climate, and the future prospects of those interesting parts of our continent; respecting which the citizens of the United States are supposed to care much, but know so little.” “Full of novelty and valuable details. The American reader will greatly add to his fund of ideas concerning South America by its perusal.” —Chronicle. “The author's graphic abilities—the pure acquaintance he displays with the Spanish language, renders his book at once pleasing and useful.” —Gaz. “Such contributions to our stock of ideas and literature, deserve a warmer welcome and wider patronage than the common-place or extravagant fictions of the day.” —National Gazette. “Much new and valuable information, imbodied in excellent language; there cannot be a moment's doubt of its popularity.” —Jour. of Belles Lettres. LETTERS ON THE UNITED STATES. Letters to a Gentleman in Germany, written after a trip from Philadelphia to Niagara, edited by Dr. Francis Lieber, in one vol. 8vo. “The mingling of anecdote, the abrupt breaks, personal narration, illustrative comparisons, and general style of the work, give it an interest that will ensure to the book general persual—while the philosophical tone which occasionally pervades its pages cannot fail of commending them to the approval of the reflecting.” —U. S. Gazette. “We have read this work with great satisfaction and interest. It abounds with characteristic anecdotes, graphic descriptions, and principles which do honour to the head and heart of the author.” —Nat. Intelligencer. The style of these Letters is, in general, very good; sometimes poetical and eloquent. “Here is a well written series of Letters, by a learned German, who has lived long enough among us, it appears, to examine the peculiarities of our government and habits, with the impartial eye of a philosopher.” —Baltimore paper. “This is a very agreeable book—rambling, sprightly, anecdotical, and withal, interspersed with much useful and practical information, and keen and accurate observation.” —New York American. SKETCHES OF SOCIETY IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. By C. S. Stewart, M. A., Chaplain of the United States' Navy, author of “A Visit to the South Seas,” “A Residence in the Sandwich Islands,” &amp;c. In two vols. 12mo. “Some of his sketches are beautiful descriptions; others are finished pictures. The charm of these volumes consists in the distinct view which the author gives us of the scenery, the country, the cities and towns, the aristocracy, the churches,—in one word, the thousand particulars, which, together, constitute what is called the state of society.” —Religious Telegraph. “We have seldom perused a work with so pleasant an interest. The contents are various and racy epistolary transcripts of the author's mind, published just as written, without revisions, and with all the gloss and freshness of first and original impressions about them. The work is full of living pictures.” “His observations on men and manners, in his description of the different scenes to which his pilgrimage was extended, are given in a style of the most flowing and attractive kind.” —N. Y. Courier. THIRTY YEARS' CORRESPONDENCE, between John Jebb, D. D. F. R. S., Bishop of Limerick, Ardfert, and Aghadoe; and Alexander Knox, Esq., M. R. I. A. Edited by the Rev. Charles Forster, B. D., perpetual curate of Ash next Sandwich; formerly, domestic Chaplain to Bishop Jebb. In two vols. 8vo. BRIDGEWATER TREATISES. This series of Treatises is published under the following circumstances:— The Right Honorable and Rev. Francis Henry, Earl of Bridgewater, died in the month of February, 1825; he directed certain trustees therein named, to invest in the public funds, the sum of eight thousand pounds sterling; this sum, with the accruing dividends thereon, to be held at the disposal of the President, for the time being, of the Royal Society of London, to be paid to the person or persons nominated by him. The Testator farther directed, that the person or persons selected by the said President, should be appointed to write, print and publish one thousand copies of a work, on the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation; illustrating such work, by all reasonable arguments, as, for instance, the variety and formation of God's creatures in the Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral Kingdoms; the effect of digestion, and, thereby, of conversion; the construction of the hand of man, and an infinite variety of other arguments; as also by discoveries, ancient and modern, in arts, sciences, and the whole extent of literature. He desired, moreover, that the profits arising from the sale of the works so published, should be paid to the authors of the works. The late President of the Royal Society, Davies Gilbert, Esq. requested the assistance of his Grace, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and of the Bishop of London, in determining upon the best mode of carrying into effect, the intentions of the Testator. Acting with their advice, and with the concurrence of a nobleman immediately connected with the deceased, Mr. Davies Gilbert appointed the following eight gentlemen to write separate Treatises in the different branches of the subjects here stated:— I. The Adaptation of External Nature to the Moral and Intellectual Constitution of Man, by the Rev. Thomas Chalmers, D. D., Professor of Divinity in the University of Edinburgh. II. The adaptation of External Nature to the Physical Condition of Man, by John Kidd, M. D., F. R. S., Regius Professor of Medicine in the University of Oxford. III. Astronomy and General Physics, considered with reference to Natural Theology, by the Rev. Wm. Whewell, M. A., F. R. S., Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. IV. The hand: its mechanism and vital endowments as evincing design, by Sir Charles Bell, K. H., F. R. S. V. Animal and Vegetable Physiology, by Peter Mark Roget, M. D., Fellow of and Secretary to the Royal Society. VI. Geology and Mineralogy, by the Rev. Wm. Buckland, D. D., F. R. S., Canon of Christ Church, and Professor of Geology in the University of Oxford. VII. The History, Habits, and Instincts of Animals, by the Rev. Wm. Kirby, M. A., F. R. S. VIII. Chemistry, Meteorology, and the Function of Digestion, by Wm. Prout, M. D., F. R. S. THE FOLLOWING ARE PUBLISHED. ASTRONOMY AND GENERAL PHYSICS, considered with reference to Natural Theology. By the Rev. William Whewell, M. A., Fellow and Tutor of Trinity College, Cambridge; being Part III. of the Bridgewater Treatises on the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation. In one vol. 12mo. “It is a work of profound investigation, deep research, distinguished alike for the calm Christian spirit which breathes throughout, and the sound, irresistible argumentation which is stamped on every page.” —Daily Intelligencer. “Let works like that before us be widely disseminated, and the bold, active, and ingenious enemies of religion be met by those, equally sagacious, alert and resolute and the most timid of the many who depend upon the few, need not fear the host that comes with subtle steps to `steal their faith away.”' —N. Y. American. “That the devoted spirit of the work is most exemplary, that we have here and there found, or fancied, room for cavil, only peradventure because we have been unable to follow the author through the prodigious range of his philosophical survey—and in a word, that the work before us would have made the reputation of any other man, and may well maintain even that of Professor Whewell.” —Metropolitan. “He has succeeded admirably in laying a broad foundation, in the light of nature, for the reception of the more glorious truths of revelation; and has produced a work well calculated to dissipate the delusions of scepticism and infidelity, and to confirm the believer in his faith.” —Charleston Courier. “The known talents, and high reputation of the author, gave an earnest of excellence, and nobly has Mr. Whewell redeemed the pledge.—In conclusion, we have no hesitation in saying, that the present is one of the best works of its kind, and admirably adapted to the end proposed; as such, we cordially recommend it to our readers.” —London Lit. Gazette. “It is a work of high character.” —Boston Recorder. A TREATISE ON THE ADAPTATION OF EXTERNAL NATURE TO THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF MAN, principally with reference to the supply of his wants, and the exercise of his intellectual faculties. By John Kidd, M. D., F. R. S., Regius Professor of Medicine in the University of Oxford; being Part II. of the Bridgewater Treatises on the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation. In one vol. 12mo. “It is ably written, and replete both with interest and instruction. The diffusion of such works cannot fail to be attended with the happiest effects in justifying `the ways of God to man,' and illustrating the wisdom and goodness of the Creator by arguments which appeal irresistably both to the reason and the feelings. Few can understand abstract reasoning, and still fewer relish it; or will listen to it: but in this work the purest morality and the kindliest feelings are inculcated through the medium of agreeable and useful information.” —Balt. Gaz. “It should be in the hands of every individual who feels disposed to `vindicate the ways of God to man.”' —N. Y. Com. Adv. CHEMISTRY, MINERALOGY, AND THE FUNCTIONS OF DIGESTION, considered with reference to Natural Theology, by William Prout, M. D. F. R. S., Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, being part eight of the Bridgewater Treatises on the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation. In 1 vol. 12mo. “For depth of investigation, extent of research and cogency of reasoning, this work will not suffer in comparison with any other of this admirable series. The deductions from the premises are strong and conclusive, and bear the impress of a calm, philosophic, and truly Christian spirit. The valuable scientific knowledge that may be derived from the Bridgewater Treaties, independent of their grand design—the illustration of the power, wisdom, and goodness of God, as manifested in the creation—should secure them a wide circulation.” —Balt. Gazette. ON THE ADAPTATION OF EXTERNAL NATURE TO THE MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL CONSTITUTION OF MAN. By the Rev. Thomas Chalmers, D. D.; being Part I. of the Bridgewater Treatises on the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God, as manifested in Creation. In 1 vol. 12mo. “The volumes before us are every way worthy of their subject. It would seem almost supererogatory to pass any judgment on the style of a writer so celebrated as Dr. Chalmers. He is well known as a logician not to be baffled by any difficulties; as one who boldly grapples with his theme, and brings every energy of his clear and nervous intellect into the field. No sophistry escapes his eagle vision—no argument that could either enforce or illustrate his subject is left untouched. Our literature owes a deep debt of gratitude to the author of these admirable volumes.” —Lit. Gaz. THE HAND: ITS MECHANISM AND VITAL ENDOWMENTS, AS EVINCING DESIGN. By Sir Charles Bell, K. G. H.; being Part IV. of the Bridgewater Treatises on the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation. In one vol. 12mo. “In the present treatise it is a matter of the warmest satisfaction to find an anatomist of Sir Charles Bell's great eminence, professing his contempt for the late fashionable doctrines of materialism held by so many anatomists, and now coming forward to present the fruits of his wide researches and great ability in a treatise so full of curious and interesting matter, expressly intended to prove, by the examination of one particular point, that design which is imprest on all parts of various animals which in some degree answer the purpose of the Hand; and has shown that the hand is not the source of contrivance, nor consequently of man's superiority, as some materialists have maintained. “To this he had added some very valuable remarks, showing the uses of Pain, and he has illustrated the work with a variety of the most admirable and interesting wood cuts.” —British Magazine. ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE PHYSIOLOGY, considered with reference to Natural Theology. By Peter Mark Roget, M. D. Being Treatise five of the Bridgewater Series: illustrated with numerous cuts. TRAITS AND TRADITIONS OF PORTUGAL, collected during a residence in that country. By Miss Pardoe. In two vols. 12mo. “A very singular and effective union of the very best properties which we seek for in books of travels on the one hand, and in works of the imagination on the other.” —Monthly Review. “The manners of Portugal were never before delineated with so much truth and vivacity.” —Standard. THE POSTHUMOUS POEMS OF THE REV. GEORGE CRABBE, with his Letters and Journals, and a Memoir of his Life. By his Son and Executor. In two handsome vols. “There are in my recess at home another Series of Stories, in number and quantity sufficient for a volume; and as they are much like the former in execution, and sufficiently different in events and characters, they may hereafter, in peaceable times, be worth something to you; and the more, because I shall, whatever is mortal of me, be at rest in the chancel of Trowbridge church.” —Crabbe to his Son. “The Life of Crabbe will be found far more abundant in striking incidents and extraordinary contrasts and reverses, than that of almost any other poet with whose personal story we are acquainted. It will be seen from his own Diaries, how calmly he had tasted, both of the very bitterest adversity—a destitute and forlorn wanderer about the streets of London,—and of what, considering his early position and distresses, may be called splendid prosperity—the honoured and admired friend of Burke, Johnson, Reynolds, Thurlow, Fox—and more recently of Scott, Rogers, Moore, &amp;c. &amp;c.—the courted guest of the noblest mansions—placed at length, by the universal consent of all capable of appreciating literary merit, on an elevation second to no one among his contemporaries.” THE BOOK OF SCIENCE; a familiar introduction to the Principles of Natural Philosophy, adapted to the comprehension of Young People; comprising Treatises on all the Sciences. Illustrated by many curious and interesting Experiments and Observations, and including Notices of the most recent Discoveries. Embellished with upwards of two hundred Engravings on wood. “This work is beautifully got up, and elegantly embellished with exceedingly clever wood cuts: it is published with the design of affording to youthful minds a brief, but yet perspicuous, exhibition of the first principles of the physical sciences, including accounts of the most important discoveries recently made in the several departments of natural knowledge. All this the book professes to do, and does it well. We think by the easy and familiar tone that it adopts in the descriptions, it will become a great favourite with youth.” —Metrop. Mag. “Here is a familiar introduction to the principles of natural philosophy. We have carefully perused every page, and every page has afforded us proofs of accuracy and observation which we hardly expected. There cannot be a more delightful present to the young or anything better calculated to refresh the memories of the old. It is the book, of all others, to teach young people how to think.” —New Monthly Magazine. “The present little volume is so written, that, with moderate attention, a youth may obtain a very clear knowledge of each branch of natural philosophy. The volume is printed uniformly with the `Boy's Own Book,” and may be said to be a suitable successor to that little work. The compiler deserves great credit for the arrangement, and also for the simple, at the same time, correct and familiar style of conveying information. We cannot do better than recommend parents to present to their children this elegant little production.” —Repertory of Arts. “Our readers will, doubtless, remember the `Boy's Own Book;' the present volume is a sequel to that amusing little work. It is got up with extreme care, and illustrated with an immense number of figures, of extraordinary neatness of execution.” —Atlas. THE HISTORY OF IRELAND. By Thomas Moore. Vol. I. HISTORY OF ENGLAND. Vol. IV. Being a continuation of Mackintosh. THE PRINCIPLES OF CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHY. Containing the Doctrines, Duties, Admonitions, and Consolations, of the Christian Religion. By John Burns, M. D., F. R. S. From the 4th London edition. In 1 vol. 12mo. “The author has unfolded the principles of Christianity with much candor and correctness; he has explained our personal and relative duties in a just and philosophical manner; and, by the ease and unaffected simplicity of his style, has rendered his treatise pleasing as well as instructive.—His remarks on brotherly love, in that part of his work embracing the relative duties, possess much to interest.” —A Traveller. “The book has a high reputation in Great Britain, and there is no being capable of reflection, who has not need, and upon whom it is not incumbent, to obtain light, and bestow concern on the topics which are here discussed. “Every page that directs the mind to what should be deemed the main interest of life, and causes operative thought in ulterior destinies, is of inestimable value.” —Nat. Gazette. PICTURES OF PRIVATE LIFE. BY SARAH STICKNEY. In 1 neat 18mo. vol. “The publishers deserve the thanks of the lovers of pure, chastened and profitable fiction for their reprint of this charming little work. It cannot fail to become as popular here as it already is in England. It is a collection of tales and sketches, designed to impress upon the mind useful lessons of piety, virtue and wisdom. It is written in a style of unusual excellence—masculine in its vigor, yet light and playful in its delicacy, and embodies several scenes of pathos and feeling of which Sterne or M'Kenzie might be proud.—To those whose taste has not been perverted by the flashy wit and nauseous sentimentality of modern fiction, we commend the immediate purchase of this delightful little work.” —Daily Intelligencer. THE CHRISTIAN YEAR. THOUGHTS IN VERSE FOR SUNDAYS AND HOLY DAYS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. “In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength.” —Isaiah xxx. 15. First American from the 25th London edition, with an introduction and notes by Bishop Doane, of New Jersey. In a handsome vol. “It may be read for purposes of devotion by Christians of whatever denomination, with pleasure and profit.” —Christian Watchman. “These verses were singularly beautiful in conception and composition, and breathe the purest poetic taste and the most sincere and fervent spirit of piety.” —Gazette. “The work should be in the hands of all who value taste, genius and piety.” —Com. Intelligencer. “We have rarely, perhaps never, met a poetical volume, more appropriate to family devotion.” —U. S. Gazette. “As a book for family reading—whether as an exercise of taste or devotion —we know of few that can surpass it.” —Gazette. A few copies have been bound in beautiful embossed leather, with gilt edges, making a very desirable volume for a present. A GUIDE TO AN IRISH GENTLEMAN IN HIS SEARCH FOR A RELIGION. By the Rev. Mortimer O'Sullivan, A. M. 1 vol. 12mo. Being an answer to Moore's work. FAMILY CABINET ATLAS. The FAMILY CABINET ATLAS, constructed upon an original plan: Being a Companion to the Encyclopædia Americana, Cabinet Cyclopædia, Family Library, Cabinet Library, &amp;c. This Atlas comprises, in a volume of the Family Library size, nearly 190 Maps and Tables, which present equal to Fifty Thousand Names of Places; a body of information three times as extensive as that supplied by the generality of Quarto Atlases. Opinions of the Public Journals. “This beautiful and most useful little volume,” says the Literary Gazette, “is a perfect picture of elegance, containing a vast sum of geographical information. A more instructive little present, or a gift better calculated to be long preserved and often referred to, could not be offered to favored youth of either sex. Its cheapness, we must add, is another recommendation; for, although this elegant publication contains 100 beautiful engravings, it is issued at a price that can be no obstacle to its being procured by every parent and friend to youth.” “This Atlas far surpasses any thing of the kind which we have seen, and is made to suit the popular libraries which Dr. Lardner and Mr. Murray are now sending into every family in the empire.” —Monthly Review. “Its very ingenious method of arrangement secures to the geographical student the information for which hitherto he has been obliged to resort to works of the largest dimensions.” —Athenœum. “This miniature and beautiful Atlas is likely to supersede, for general purposes, maps of a more expensive and elaborate character. It appears to us to answer the double purpose of exercising the attention, while it imprints all that is important in Geography on the memory.” —Atlas. “The workmanship is among the best of the kind we have ever witnessed.” — Examiner. “It contains all the information to be derived from the most expensive and unwieldy Atlas.” —York Courant. HISTORY OF THE REVOLUTION IN ENGLAND, IN 1688: comprising a View of the Reign of James II., from his accession, to the Enterprise of the Prince of Orange. By the late Right Hon. Sir James Mackintosh. And completed to the Settlement of the Crown, by the Editor. To which is prefixed, a Notice of the Life, Writings, and Speeches of Sir James Mackintosh. In 1 vol. 8vo. “We are at length gratified by the appearance of this long-looked for work from the pen of Sir James Mackintosh. Highly gifted by nature, deeply read, and singularly accomplished the view of one of the most memorable epochs in English history could not have been undertaken by any man of a capacity to do it justice in every respect, superior to this eminent individual.” —Lit. Gazette. “In every page we perceive the anxiety of the historian to hold the balance of justice with unfaltering hand, and to watch its slightest vibrations.” —Athenœum. “The Sequel is highly honourable to the industry and talents of its author; and the Prefatory Memoir is very well written. Altogether, the volume possesses a sterling character, too rare at this period of evanescent publications.” —Lit. Gazette. LIFE OF THE REV. GEORGE CRABBE, LL. B., with his Letters and Journals, together with his Posthumous Poems. Edited by his Son. In 2 neat volumes. Moore's New Work. TRAVELS OF AN IRISH GENTLEMAN, IN SEARCH OF A RELIGION. With Notes and Illustrations. By the Editor of Captain Rock's Memoirs. In 1 vol. 12mo. “Considering the circumstances under which these volumes are given to the public, we consider their contents as amongst the most interesting records of which the assertion of the human mind ever formed the theme.” —Monthly Review. “The masterly manner in which Mr. Moore has brought together his arguments, the great extent and minuteness of his researches into ancient authorities, his intimacy with the customs and traditions of other times, and his close and critical knowledge of the ancient languages, will surprise the reader of his Travels, who may have measured his talents by his songs.” —American Sentinel. THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS. With coloured plates: elegantly bound, with gilt edges: a beautiful volume for a present. SISMONDI'S HISTORY OF THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE: COMPRISING A VIEW OF THE INVASION OF THE BARBARIANS. THE INFIRMITIES OF GENIUS, Illustrated by referring the anomalies in the literary character, to the habits and constitutional peculiarities of Men of Genius. By R. R. Madden, Esq. In 2 vols. 12mo. “This is a very valuable and interesting work, full of new views and curious deductions; beginning with general remarks on the influence of literary habits, on the constitution, and thence proceeding to make the theory more actual by its application to particular instances. “His physical biographies, if we may so term them, of Burns, Cowper, Byron, and Scott, are of a very curious and novel kind; written with equal feeling and observation. He traces Cowper's malady to its true source, monomania on religious subjects; and the tone of the remarks is at once so just and so candid, that we cannot do better than give a brief portion.” —Lit. Gazette. THE LIFE OF PRINCE TALLEYRAND. Accompanied by a Portrait. In 1 volume, 8vo. “How could the work be otherwise than interesting, when it traces the career of a statesman, who, though now in his eighty-first year, has commanding influence in every European cabinet, who acquired power under the French monarchy, and retained it under the Republic, the Directory, the Consulate, the Empire, and the Dynasty of Artois and Orleans?” —Athenæum. THE PREMIUM, A PRESENT FOR ALL SEASONS: Consisting of elegant selections from British and American writers of the 19th century. In one small neat volume, elegantly bound in morocco; with engravings, by Ellis, from designs by Westall and Richter. This work particularly commends itself to school teachers, parents, and others, who may be in search of a volume to present to either sex. “A delightful little bouquet of `elegant extracts,' from the best writers of prose and poetry in Great Britain and America. The premiums would be a pretty present for young ladies, or students, emulous to be noticed or rewarded.” —Sentinel. “It is a collection, or rather let us say, a selection of pieces in prose and verse, that have real merit, with reference both to style and sentiment. They are choice, and will be useful to improve the taste and strengthen the morals. The author has done a good work, and those who wish to give the most deserving a beautiful and a useful `premium,' will find the work to which we refer altogether suitable.” —U. S. Gazette. “Carey, Lea &amp; Blanchard have given us a choice selection of gems, from the best popular writers of the day, under the above title. It contains articles from the pens of Croley, Wilson, Byron, Mary Howitt, Mrs. Hemans, Moore, Hood, Dr. Bird, Campbell, Manning, Irving, Webster, Sprague, Braining, Percival, &amp;c. The volume is a pleasant one, and the selections such as their respective authors have no need to be ashamed of.” —N. Y. Com. Advertiser. “This is a neat volume composed of extracts from the celebrated writers of the present century. The selections are admirably made, and the work is got up with unusual elegance. The binding is a beautiful specimen of the skill which has been attained in this important department of book-making. The volume is one of rare beauty, and constitutes a cheap, elegant, and appropriate present.” —Daily Intelligencer. “A very neat and instructive present for youth at all seasons.” —Nat. Gaz. A TREATISE ON ASTRONOMY. BY SIR JOHN F. W. HERSCHEL, F. R. S. &amp;C. In 1 vol. 12mo. “The present treatise is in no wise inferior to its predecessor: it is characterized by the same agreeable and elegant style, the same facility of illustration—added to which it possesses unrivalled precision and accuracy of demonstration. Avoiding, therefore, the abstruse niceties and the transcendental mathematics of the subject, the author has nevertheless produced a volume calculated, we are fully persuaded, to impress upon his readers the magnitude and importance of the science, and to initiate them in no mean degree into its mysteries.” —Lit. Gazette. Memoirs of the Court OF KING CHARLES THE FIRST. By Lucy Aikin. In Two Volumes, 8vo. TALES AND CONVERSATIONS, OR, THE NEW CHILDREN'S FRIEND. By Mrs. Markham, Author of the Histories of England and France. In 2 small volumes. “We conscientiously recommend Mrs. Markham to our readers.” —Lit. Gazette. “These volumes contain excellent instruction in a very agreeable form.” — Spectator. “We have two neat volumes, containing a series of Dialogues, by Mrs. Markham, designed for the improvement of young people. We have examined them carefully, and can say that we think them well adapted to the purpose of the author. They are sufficiently simple to be understood by boys and girls who have just begun to take to their books; they convey lessons well worth the study of all who are yet classed among young people; and they are interesting enough to secure the attention of those whom they are designed to instruct.” —Chronicle. MRS. TROLLOPE'S BELGIUM AND WESTERN GERMANY. INCLUDING VISITS TO BADEN-BADEN, WEISBADEN, CASSEL, HANOVER, &amp;C. &amp;C. IN 1 VOL. “We have pleasure in saying, that we think her style considerably strengthened and improved since her `Tour in America.” —Quarterly Review. MEMOIRS OF CELEBRATED WOMEN OF ALL COUNTRIES.

De Toqueville, Counsellors in the Royal Court of Paris, and Members of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. Translated from the French: with an introduction, notes, and additions. By Francis Leiber. In 1 vol. 8vo. “The commissioners appear to have pursued their researches with much industry and intelligence, and to have rendered themselves thoroughly acquainted with the subject.” “The translation of the work could not have been committed to better hands than Mr. Leiber's, and with his notes and additions, it forms one of the best practical treatises extant on the causes and prevention of crime. We shall probably have occasion to recur again to this valuable work.” —Balt. American. HISTORY OF SPAIN AND PORTUGAL. Complete, in 5 vols. 12mo. “A work unequalled in modern English historical literature.” —Athenœum. Miscellaneous. NOTES on ITALY, during the years 1829-30. By Rembrandt Peale. In 1 vol. 8vo. “This artist will gratify all reasonable expectation; he is neither ostentatious, nor dogmatical, nor too minute; he is not a partisan nor a carper; he admires without servility, he criticises without malevolence; his frankness and good humor give an agreeable color and effect to all his decisions, and the object of them; his book leaves a useful general idea of the names, works, and deserts, of the great masters; it is an instructive and entertaining index.” —Nat. Gaz. “We have made a copious extract in preceding columns from this interesting work of our countryman, Rembrandt Peale, recently published. It has received high commendation from respectable sources, which is justified by the portions we have seen extracted.” —Commercial Advertiser. “Mr. Peale must be allowed the credit of candor and entire freedom from affectation in the judgments he has passed. At the same time, we should not omit to notice the variety, extent, and minuteness of his examinations. No church, gallery, or collection, was passed by, and most of the individual pictures are separately and carefully noticed.” —Am. Quarterly Review. MEMOIRS of the LIFE of SIR WALTER RALEGH, with some account of the Period in which he lived. By Mrs. A. T. Thomson. With a portrait. “Such is the outline of a life, which, in Mrs. Thomson's hands, is a mine of interest; from the first page to the last the attention is roused and sustained, and while we approve the manner, we still more applaud the spirit in which it is executed.” —Literary Gazette. “In all respects a most appropriate volume for the Cabinet Library. We shall take an opportunity in another notice, to give some of the many interesting passages in the volume that offer themselves for quotation.” —N. Y. Amer. “The book is unquestionably the best Life of Ralegh that has ever been written.” —Album. “This is a piece of biography which combines the fascinations of romance with the deeper interest that attaches to historical narrative.” —South. Patriot. ELEGANT LIBRARY EDITIONS of the following works. WORKS of JOANNA BAILLIE. Complete in 1 volume 8vo. WORKS of HENRY FIELDING. In 2 vols. 8vo., with a portrait. WORKS of TOBIAS SMOLLETT.

Moyle Sherer, Author of Recollections of the Peninsula. In 2 vols. 18mo. “The tone of feeling and reflection which pervades the work is in the characteristic mood of the writer, considerate, ardent, and chivalrous; his principles, as might be expected, are sound and independent, and his language is frequently rich in those beauties which distinguish his previous writings. To us it appears a work which will not discredit its illustrious subject.” —United Service Journal. THE COMPLETE POETICAL WORKS OF JOANNA BAILLIE. 1 vol. 8vo. This edition corresponds with the Library Editions of Byron, Scott, Moore, &amp;c. “Miss Baillie's Plays on the Passions have been long known as among the best in the language. No one who reads them can entertain a doubt of the character of the writer's affections. Such works could never have been dictated by a cold heart.” —Christian Examiner. “We are among the most earnest admirers of her genius, her literary attainments and skill, her diction, her success, her moral designs, and her personal worth. Some of her tragedies have deservedly passed into the stock of the principal British and American theatres. They are express developments and delineations of the passions, marked by a deep insight into human nature, great dramatic power of treatment, a fertile spirit of poetry, and the loftiest and purest moral sentiment.” —National Gazette. TREATISE on CLOCK and WATCHMAKING, Theoretical and Practical. By Thomas Reid, Edinburgh Honorary Member of the Worshipful Company of Clock-Makers, London. Royal 8vo. Illustrated by numerous Plates. GEOLOGICAL MANUAL. By H. T. De la Beche. In 8vo. with numerous wood-cuts. “A work of first-rate importance in the science to which it relates, and which must henceforth take its place in the library of every student in Geology.” — Phil. Magazine. “Mr. De la Beche's Geological Manual is the first and best work of the kind, and he has performed his task with a perfect knowledge of all that has been ascertained in Geology, and with considerable judgment and taste in the manner of doing it. So much geological science was never before compressed in so small a space.” —Spectator. HISTORY OF ENGLAND, by Sir James Mackintosh. Octavo edition. œ The first volume of this edition will contain the same matter as the first three volumes of the 18mo. edition. A COLLECTION OF COLLOQUIAL PHRASES, on every subject necessary to maintain Conversation, the whole so disposed as considerably to facilitate the acquisition of the Italian language.

In 2 vols. “We have read a part of Washington Irving's new Sketch Book, the scene of which is Spain, the most romantic of European countries, and the best known by the gifted author. His style has lost nothing of its peculiar charm,—his descriptions are as graphic as usual, and enlivened with racy anecdotes and happy reflection. We shall probably soon furnish a specimen of this work, from the whole of which we expect gratification.” —Nat. Gazette. The BRAVO. By the author of the “Spy,” “Pilot,” “Red Rover,” &amp;c. In 2 vols. 12mo. “Let us honestly avow in conclusion, that in addition to the charm of an interesting fiction to be found in these pages, there is more mental power in them, more matter that sets people thinking, more of that quality that is accelerating the onward movement of the world, than in all the Scotch novels that have so deservedly won our admiration.” —New Monthly Mag. “This new novel from the pen of our countryman, Cooper, will win new laurels for him. It is full of dramatic interest—“hair-breadth escapes”— animated and bustling scenes on the canals, in the prisons, on the Rialto, in the Adriatic, and in the streets of Venice.” —N. Y. Courier &amp; Enquirer. “Of the whole work, we may confidently say that it is very able—a performance of genius and power.” —Nat. Gazette. “The Bravo will, we think, tend much to exalt and extend the fame of its author. We have hurried through its pages with an avidity which must find its apology in the interesting character of the incidents and the very vivid and graphic style in which they are described.” By the same author. The HEIDENMAUER, or Pagan Camp. In 2 vols. SALMONIA; or, Days of Fly Fishing; by Sir H. Davy. “We are surprised, in meeting with an American reprint of this delightful volume, that a work so universally popular has not been before republished in this country.” —N. Y. American. “One of the most delightful labors of leisure ever seen; not a few of the most beautiful phenomena of nature are here lucidly explained.” —Gent. Mag. The NATURAL HISTORY of SELBORNE. By the late Rev. Gilbert White, A. M., Fellow of the Oriel College, Oxford, with additions, by Sir William Jardine, Bart. F. R. S. E. F. L. S. M. W. S., author of “Illustrations of Ornithology.” “`White's History of Selborne,' the most fascinating piece of rural writing and sound English philosophy that has ever issued from the press.” —Athenœum. The MECHANISM of the HEAVENS, by Mrs. Somerville. In 18mo. “We possess already innumerable discourses on Astronomy, in which the wonders of the heavens and their laws are treated of; but we can say most conscientiously that we are acquainted with none—not even La Place's own beautiful expose in his System du Monde,—in which all that is essentially interesting in the motions and laws of the celestial bodies, or which is capable of popular enunciation, is so admirably, so graphically, or we may add, so unaffectedly and simply placed before us. * * * Is it asking too much of Mrs. Somerville to express a hope that she will allow this beautiful preliminary Dissertation to be printed separately, for the delight and instruction of thousands of readers, young and old, who cannot understand, or are too indolent to apply themselves to the more elaborate parts of the work? If she will do this, we hereby promise to exert our best endeavors to make its merits known.” —Literary Gazette. TOUR of a GERMAN PRINCE, (Puckler Muskau,) through the Southern and Western parts of England, Wales, Ireland, and France. In 8vo. Second American edition. “It contains the least prejudiced and most acute notices we have read of the habits and modes of thinking of Englishmen, and the merits and defects of the country and society.” —Globe.

The DUCHESS of BERRI, in LA VENDEE, comprising a Narrative of her Adventures, with her private papers and secret correspondence, by General Dermoncourt, who arrested her royal highness at Nantes. In 1 vol. 12mo. [This edition exclusively contains the important documents and papers which would have led to the seizure of the work in France, had they been published there.] “Upon its high interest we need not enlarge: the personal adventures of the princess, her journeyings on foot and on horseback, in disguise and in her own character, her mental and bodily sufferings, her hopes and her despair, are a romance, and seem to belong to another age. They recall the wanderings and the perils of our own Charles Edward, with all the additional interest which must attach to the daring and the suffering of a woman.” —Athenæum. The ECONOMY of MACHINERY and MANUFACTURES. By Chares Babbage. 18mo. “Of the many publications which have recently issued from the press, calculated to give a popular and attractive form to the results of science, we look upon this volume as by far the most valuable. Mr. Babbage's name is well known in connexion with the general subject of which he has here undertaken to treat. But it will be difficult for the reader who does not possess the volume itself, to understand the happy style, the judgment and tact, by means of which the author has contrived to lend almost the charm of romance to the apparently dry and technical theme which he has chosen.” —Monthly Rev. OUSELEY'S REMARKS on the STATISTICS and POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS of the UNITED STATES. “The author is a man of solid sense, friendly to this country, and his remarks have the value and interest of which his character and inquiries authorized the expectation.” —National Gazette. TWO YEARS AND A HALF IN THE NAVY, or, Journal of a Cruise in the Mediterranean and Levant, on board the U. S. Frigate Constellation, in the Years 1829, 1830, and 1831. By E. C. Wines. In 2 vols. 12mo. “The author is a gentleman of classical education, a shrewd observer, a lively writer, whose natural manner is always agreeable; whose various matter is generally entertaining and instructive; and whose descriptions are remarkably graphic. The greater portion of his pages have yielded us both profit and pleasure.” —Nat. Gaz. WASHINGTON IRVING. VOYAGES and ADVENTURES of the COMPANIONS of COLUMBUS. By Washington Irving, Author of the Life of Columbus, &amp;c. 1 vol. 8vo. “Of the main work we may repeat that it possesses the value of important history and the magnetism of romantic adventure. It sustains in every respect the reputation of Irving.” “We may hope that the gifted author will treat in like manner the enterprises and exploits of Pizarro and Cortes; and thus complete a series of elegant recitals, which will contribute to the especial gratification of Americans, and form an imperishable fund of delightful instruction for all ages and countries.” —Nat. Gazette. “As he leads us from one savage tribe to another, as he paints successive scenes of heroism, perseverance and self-denial, as he wanders among the magnificent scenes of nature, as he relates with scrupulous fidelity the errors, and the crimes, even of those whose lives are for the most part marked with traits to command admiration, and perhaps esteem—everywhere we find him the same undeviating, but beautiful moralist, gathering from every incident some lesson to present in striking language to the reason and the heart.” —Am. Quarterly Review. “This is a delightful volume; for the preface truly says that the expeditions narrated and springing out of the voyages of Columbus may be compared with attempts of adventurous knights-errant to achieve the enterprise left unfinished by some illustrious predecessors. Washington Irving's name is a pledge how well their stories will be told: and we only regret that we must of necessity defer our extracts for a week.” —London Lit. Gazette. A CHRONICLE of the CONQUEST of GRENADA. By Washington Irving, Esq. In 2 vols. “On the whole, this work will sustain the high fame of Washington Irving. It fills a blank in the historical library which ought not to have remained so long a blank. The language throughout is at once chaste and animated; and the narrative may be said, like Spenser's Fairy Queen, to present one long gallery of splendid pictures.” —Lond. Lit. Gazette. The ALHAMBRA; a Series of Tales and Sketches of the Moors and Spaniards. By the author of the Sketch-Book. In 2 vols. “We have read a part of Washington Irving's new Sketch-Book, the scene of which is in Spain, the most romantic of European countries, and the best known by the gifted author. His style has lost nothing of its peculiar charm —his descriptions are as graphic as usual, and enlivened with racy anecdotes and happy reflection. We shall probably soon furnish a specimen of this work, from the whole of which we expect gratification.” —Nat. Gazette. New Editions of the following Works by the same Author.

In 3 vols. “The reader will at once perceive that the subject, the characters and the scenes of action, could not have been better selected for the display of the various and unequalled powers of the author. All that is glorious in arts and splendid in arms—the glitter of armor, the pomp of war, and the splendor of chivalry —the gorgeous scenery of the Bosphorus—the ruins of Byzantium—the magnificence of the Grecian capital, and the richness and voluptuousness of the imperial court, will rise before the reader in a succession of beautiful and dazzling images.” —Commercial Advertiser. AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF SIR WALTER SCOTT. With a Portrait. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. In 2 vols. “The History of Scotland, by Sir Walter Scott, we do not hesitate to declare, will be, if possible, more extensively read, than the most popular work of fiction, by the same prolific author, and for this obvious reason: it combines much of the brilliant coloring of the Ivanhoe pictures of by-gone manners, and all the graceful facility of style and picturesqueness of description of his other charming romances, with a minute fidelity to the facts of history, and a searching scrutiny into their authenticity and relative value, which might put to the blush Mr. Hume and other professed historians. Such is the magic charm of Sir Walter Scott's pen, it has only to touch the simplest incident of every-day life, and it starts up invested with all the interest of a scene of romance; and yet such is his fidelity to the text of nature, that the knights, and serfs, and collared fools with whom his inventive genius has peopled so many volumes, are regarded by us as not mere creations of fancy, but as real flesh and blood existences, with all the virtues, feelings and errors of common-place humanity.” —Lit.

MILITARY MEMOIRS of the DUKE of WELLINGTON. By Capt. Moyle Sherer, Author of Recollections of the Peninsula. In 2 vols. 18mo. “The tone of feeling and reflection which pervades the work is in the characteristic mood of the writer, considerate, ardent, and chivalrous; his principles, as might be expected, are sound and independent, and his language is frequently rich in those beauties which distinguish his previous writings. To us it appears a work which will not discredit its illustrious subject.” —United Service Journal. GLEANINGS in NATURAL HISTORY, being a Companion to the Journal of a Naturalist. “The Cabinet Library bids fair to be a series of great value, and is recommended to public and private libraries, to professional men, and miscellaneous readers generally. It is beautifully printed, and furnished at a price which will place it within the reach of all classes of society.” —American Traveller. “The series of instructive, and, in their original form, expensive works, which these enterprising publishers are now issuing under the title of the “Cabinet Library,” is a fountain of useful, and almost universal knowledge; the advantages of which, in forming the opinions, tastes and manners of that portion of society, to which this varied information is yet new, cannot be too highly estimated.” —National Journal. “Messrs. Carey and Lea have commenced a series of publications under the above title, which are to appear monthly, and which seem likely, from the specimen before us, to acquire a high degree of popularity, and to afford a mass of various information and rich entertainment, at once eminently useful and strongly attractive. The mechanical execution is fine, the paper and typography excellent.” —Nashville Banner. MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE OF SIR WALTER RALEGH, with some Account of the Period in which he lived. By MRS. A. T. THOMSON. With a Portrait. “Such is the outline of a life, which, in Mrs. Thomson's hands, is a mine of interest: from the first page to the last the attention is roused and sustained, and while we approve the manner, we still more applaud the spirit in which it is executed.” —Literary Gazette. JOURNAL OF A NATURALIST. With Plates. —Plants, trees, and stones we note; Birds, insects, beasts, and rural things. “We again most strongly recommend this little unpretending volume to the attention of every lover of nature, and more particularly of our country readers. It will induce them, we are sure, to examine more closely than they have been accustomed to do, into the objects of animated nature, and such examination will prove one of the most innocent, and the most satisfactory sources of gratification and amusement. It is a book that ought to find its way into every rural drawing-room in the kingdom, and one that may safely be placed in every lady's boudoir, be her rank and station in life what they may.” —Quarterly Review, No. LXXVIII. “We think that there are few readers who will not be delighted (we are certain all will be instructed) by the `Journal of a Naturalist.”' —Monthly Review. “This is a most delightful book on the most delightful of all studies. We are acquainted with no previous work which bears any resemblance to this, except `White's History of Selborne,' the most fascinating piece of rural writing and sound English philosophy that ever issued from the press.” —Athenœum. “The author of the volume now before us, has produced one of the most charming volumes we remember to have seen for a long time.” —New Monthly Magazine, June, 1829. “A delightful volume—perhaps the most so—nor less instructive and amusing —given to Natural History since White's Selborne.” —Blackwood's Magazine. “The Journal of a Naturalist, being the second number of Carey and Lea's beautiful edition of the Cabinet Library, is the best treatise on subjects connected with this train of thought, that we have for a long time perused, and we are not at all surprised that it should have received so high and flattering encomiums from the English press generally.” —Boston Traveller. “Furnishing an interesting and familiar account of the various objects of animated nature, but calculated to afford both instruction and entertainment.” —Nashville Banner. “One of the most agreeable works of its kind in the language.” —Courier de la Louisiane. “It abounds with numerous and curious facts, pleasing illustrations of the secret operations and economy of nature, and satisfactory displays of the power, wisdom and goodness, of the great Creator.” —Philad. Album. THE MARQUESS OF LONDONDERRY'S NARRATIVE OF THE LATE WAR IN GERMANY AND FRANCE. With a Map. “No history of the events to which it relates can be correct without reference to its statements.” —Literary Gazette. “The events detailed in this volume cannot fail to excite an intense interest.” —Dublin Literary Gazette. “The only connected and well authenticated account we have of the spirit-stirring scenes which preceded the fall of Napoleon. It introduces us into the cabinets and presence of the allied monarchs. We observe the secret policy of each individual: we see the course pursued by the wily Bernadotte, the temporizing Metternich, and the ambitious Alexander. The work deserves a place in every historical library.” —Globe. “We hail with pleasure the appearance of the first volume of the Cabinet Library.” “The author had singular facilities for obtaining the materials of his work, and he has introduced us to the movements and measures of cabinets which have hitherto been hidden from the world.” —American Traveller. “It may be regarded as the most authentic of all the publications which profess to detail the events of the important campaigns, terminating with that which secured the capture of the French metropolis.” —Nat. Journal. “It is in fact the only authentic account of the memorable events to which it refers.” —Nashville Banner. “The work deserves a place in every library.” —Philadelphia Album. LARDNER'S CABINET CYCLOPæDIA. HISTORY OF ENGLAND. By Sir James Mackintosh. In 8 Vols. Vols. 1, 2 and 3 published. “In the first volume of Sir James Mackintosh's History of England, we find enough to warrant the anticipations of the public, that a calm and luminous philosophy will diffuse itself over the long narrative of our British History.” —Edinburgh Review. “In this volume Sir James Mackintosh fully developes those great powers, for the possession of which the public have long given him credit. The result is the ablest commentary that has yet appeared in our language upon some of the most important circumstances of English History.” —Atlas. “Worthy in the method, style, and reflections, of the author's high reputation. We were particularly pleased with his high vein of philosophical sentiment, and his occasional survey of contemporary annals.” —Nat. Gazette. “If talents of the highest order, long experience in politics, and years of application to the study of history and the collection of information, can command superiority in a historian, Sir James Machintosh may, without reading this work, be said to have produced the best history of this country. A perusal of the work will prove that those who anticipated a superior production, have not reckoned in vain on the high qualifications of the author.” —Courier. THE HISTORY OF THE NETHERLANDS, to the Battle of Waterloo. By T. C. Grattan. “It is but justice to Mr. Grattan to say that he has executed his laborious task with much industry and proportionate effect. Undisfigured by pompous nothingness, and without any of the affectation of philosophical profundity, his style is simple, light, and fresh—perspicuous, smooth, and harmonious.” —La Belle Assemblée. “Never did work appear at a more fortunate period. The volume before us is a compressed but clear and impartial narrative.” —Lit. Gaz. HISTORY OF FRANCE. By Eyre Evans Crowe. In 3 vols. “His history of France is worthy to figure with the works of his associates, the best of their day, Scott and Mackintosh.” —Monthly Mag. “For such a task Mr. Crowe is eminently qualified. At a glance, as it were, his eye takes in the theatre of centuries. His style is neat, clear, and pithy; and his power of condensation enables him to say much, and effectively, in a few words, to present a distinct and perfect picture in a narrowly circumscribed space.” —La Belle Assemblée. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. By Sir Walter Scott. In 2 Vols. “The History of Scotland, by Sir Walter Scott, we do not hesitate to declare, will be, if possible, more extensively read, than the most popular work of fiction, by the same prolific author, and for this obvious reason: it combines much of the brilliant coloring of the Ivanhoe pictures of by-gone manners, and all the graceful facility of style and picturesqueness of description of his other charming romances, with a minute fidelity to the facts of history, and a searching scrutiny into their authenticity and relative value, which might put to the blush Mr. Hume and other professed historians.

Gazette. HISTORY of the RISE, PROGRESS, and PRESENT STATE of the SILK MANUFACTURE; with numerous engravings. “It contains abundant information in every department of this interesting branch of human industry—in the history, culture, and manufacture of silk.” —Monthly Magazine. “There is a great deal of curious information in this little volume.” —Lit. Gaz. HISTORY of the ITALIAN REPUBLICS; being a View of the Rise, Progress, and Fall of Italian Freedom. By J. C. L. De Sismondi. “The excellencies, defects, and fortunes of the governments of the Italian commonwealths, form a body of the most valuable materials for political philosophy. It is time that they should be accessible to the American people, as they are about to be rendered in Sismondi's masterly abridgment. He has done for his large work, what Irving accomplished so well for his Life of Columbus.” —National Gazette. HISTORY of the RISE, PROGRESS, and PRESENT STATE of the MANUFACTURES of PORCELAIN and GLASS. With numerous Wood Cuts. “In the design and execution of the work, the author has displayed considerable judgment and skill, and has so disposed of his valuable materials as to render the book attractive and instructive to the general class of readers.” —Sat. Evening Post. “The author has, by a popular treatment, made it one of the most interesting books that has been issued of this series. There are, we believe, few of the useful arts less generally understood than those of porcelain and glass making. These are completely illustrated by Dr. Lardner, and the various processes of forming differently fashioned utensils, are fully described.” BIOGRAPHY of BRITISH STATESMEN; containing the Lives of Sir Thomas More, by Sir James Mackintosh; Cardinal Wolsey, Archbishop Cranmer, and Lord Burleigh. “A very delightful volume, and on a subject likely to increase in interest as it proceeds. * * * We cordially commend the work both for its design and execution.” —London Lit. Gazette. The HISTORY of SPAIN and PORTUGAL. In 5 vols. “A general History of the Spanish and Portuguese Peninsula, is a great de sideratum in our language, and we are glad to see it begun under such favorable suspices. We have seldom met with a narrative which fixes attention more steadily, and bears the reader's mind along more pleasantly.” “In the volumes before us, there is unquestionable evidence of capacity for the task, and research in the execution.” —U. S. Journal. “Of course this work can be but an abridgment; but we know not where so much ability has been shown in condensation. It is unequalled, and likely long to remain so. * * We were convinced, on the publication of the first volume, that it was no common compilation, manufactured to order; we were prepared to announce it as a very valuable addition to our literature. * * * Our last words must be, heartily to recommend it to our readers.” —Athenœum. HISTORY of SWITZERLAND. “Like the preceding historical numbers of this valuable publication, it abounds with interesting details, illustrative of the habits, character, and political complexion of the people and country it describes; and affords, in the small space of one volume, a digest of all the important facts which, in more olaborate histories, occupy five times the space.” —Evening Post.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CABINET CYCLOPæDIA, conducted by the REV. DIONYSIUS LARDNER, LL. D. F. R. S. L. &amp; E. M. R. I. A. F. L. S. F. Z. S. Hon. F. C. P. S. M. Ast. S. &amp;c. &amp;c. assisted by EMINENT LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC MEN. Now Publishing by Carey, Lea, &amp; Blanchard, and for sale by all Booksellers This work will form a popular compendium of whatever is useful, instructive, and interesting, in the circle of human knowledge. A novel plan of publication and arrangement has been adopted, which presents peculiar advantages. Without fully detailing the method, a few of these advantages may be mentioned. Each volume will contain one or more subjects uninterrupted and unbroken, and will be accompanied by the corresponding plates or other appropriate illustrations. Facility of reference will be obtained without fettering the work by a continued alphabetical arrangement. A subscriber may omit particular volumes or sets of volumes, without disintegrating his series. Thus each purchaser may form from the “Cabinet” a Cyclopædia, more or less comprehensive, as may suit his means, taste, or profession. If a subscriber desire to discontinue the work at any stage of its publication, the volumes which he may have received will not lose their value by separation from the rest of the work, since they will always either be complete in themselves, or may be made so at a trifling expense. The purchasers will never find their property in this work destroyed by the publication of a second edition. The arrangement is such that particular volumes may be re-edited or re-written without disturbing the others. The “Cabinet Cyclopædia” will thus be in a state of continual renovation, keeping pace with the never-ceasing improvements in knowledge, drawing within its circle from year to year whatever is new, and casting off whatever is obsolete, so as to form a constantly modernized Cyclopædia. Such are a few of the advantages which the proprietors have to offer to the public, and which they pledge themselves to realize. Treatises on subjects which are technical and professional will be adapted, not so much to those who desire to attain a practical proficiency, as to those who seek that portion of information respecting such matters which is generally expected from well-educated persons. An interest will be imparted to what is abstract by copious illustrations, and the sciences will be readered attractive, by treating them with reference to the most familiar objects and occurrences. The unwieldly bulk of Encyclopædias, not less than the abstruse discussions which they contain, has hitherto consigned them to the library, as works of only occasional reference. The present work, from its portable form and popular style, will claim a place in the drawing-room and the boudoir. Forming in itself a Complete Library, affording an extensive and infinitely varied store of instruction and amusement, presenting just so much on every subject as those not professionally engaged in it require, convenient in size, attractive in form, elegant in illustrations, and most moderate in expense, the “Cabinet Cyclopædia” will, it is hoped, be found an object of paramount interest in every family. To the heads of schools and all places of public education the proprietors trust that this work will particularly recommend itself. It seems scarcely necessary to add, that nothing will be admitted into the pages of the “Cabinet Cyclopædia” which can have the most remote tendency to offend public or private morals. To enforce the cultivation of religion and the practice of virtue should be a principal object with all who undertake to inform the public mind; but with the views just explained, the conductor of this work feels these considerations more especially pressed upon his attention. Parents and guardians may, therefore, rest assured that they will never find it necessary to place a volume of the “Cabinet” beyond the reach of their children or pupils. “It is not easy to devise a cure for such a state of things (the declining taste for science;) but the most obvious remedy is to provide the educated classes with a series of works on popular and practical science, freed from mathematical symbols and technical terms, written in simple and perspicuous language, and illustrated by facts and experiments, which are level to the capacity of ordinary minds.” Quarterly Review. PRELIMINARY DISCOURSE ON THE OBJECTS, ADVANTAGES, AND PLEASURES OF THE STUDY OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. By J. T. W. Herschel, A. M. late Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge. “Without disparaging any other of the many interesting and instructive volumes issued in the form of cabinet and family libraries, it is, perhaps, not too much to place at the head of the list, for extent and variety of condensed information, Mr. Herchel's discourse of Natural Philosophy in Dr. Lardner's Cyclopædia.” —Christian Observer. “The finest work of philosophical genius which this age has seen.” —Mackintosh's England. “By far the most delightful book to which the existing competition between literary rivals of great talent and enterprise has given rise.” —Monthly Review. “Mr. Herschel's delightful volume. * * * We find scattered through the work instances of vivid and happy illustration, where the fancy is usefully called into action, so as sometimes to remind us of the splendid pictures which crowd upon us in the style of Bacon.” —Quarterly Review. “It is the most exciting volume of the kind we ever met with.” —Monthly Magazine. “One of the most instructive and delightful books we have ever perused.” — U. S. Journal. A TREATISE ON MECHANICS. By Capt. Kater, and the Rev. Dionysius Lardner. With numerous engravings. “A work which contains an uncommon amount of useful information, exhibited in a plain and very intelligible form.” —Olmsted's Nat. Philosophy. “This volume has been lately published in England, as a part of Dr. Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopædia, and has received the unsolicited approbation of the most eminent men of science, and the most discriminating journals and reviews, in the British metropolis.—It is written in a popular and intelligible style, entirely free from mathematical symbols, and disencumbered as far as possible of teclinical phrases.” —Boston Traveller. “Admirable in development and clear in principles, and especially felicitous in illustration from familiar subjects.” —Monthly Mag. OUTLINES OF HISTORY, from the earliest period to the present time. A TREATISE ON HYDROSTATICS AND PNEUMATICS. By the Rev. D. Lardner. With numerous engravings. “It fully sustairs the favorable opinion we have already expressed as to this valuable compendium of modern science.” —Lit. Gazette. “Dr. Lardner has made a good use of his acquaimance with the familiar facts which illustrate the principles of science.” —Monthly Magazine. “It is written with a full knowledge of the subject, and in a popular style, abounding in practical illustrations of the abstruse operations of these important sciences.” —U. S. Journal. THE PEOPLE'S LIBRARY. “The editors and publishers should receive the thanks of the present generation, and the gratitude of posterity, for being the first to prepare in this language what deserves to be entitled not the ENCYCLOPæDIA AMERICANA, but the people's library.” —N.

      <field name="fulltext">the ENCYCLOPæDIA AMERICANA: a POPULAR DICTIONARY of ARTS, SCIENCES, LITERATURE, HISTORY, AND POLITICS, brought down to the present time, and including a copious collection of original articles in AMERICAN BIOGRAPHY: On the basis of the Seventh Edition of the German CONVERSATIONS-LEXICON. Edited by FRANCIS LIEBER, assisted by EDWARD WIGGLESWORTH and T. G. BRADFORD, Esqrs. IN THIRTEEN LARGE VOLUMES, OCTAVO, PRICE TO SUBSCRIBERS, BOUND IN CLOTH, TWO DOLLARS AND A HALF EACH. EACH VOLUME WILL CONTAIN BETWEEN 600 AND 700 PAGES. “THE WORLD-RENOWNED CONVERSATIONS-LEXICON.” —Edinburgh Review. “To supersede cumbrous Encyclopædias, and put within the reach of the poorest man, a complete library, equal to about forty or fifty good-sized octavos, embracing every possible subject of interest to the number of 20,000 in all—provided he can spare either from his earnings or his extravagancies, twenty cents a week, for three years, a library so contrived, as to be equally suited to the learned and the unlearned,—the mechanic—the merchant, and the professional man.” —N. Y. Courier and Inquirer. “The reputation of this valuable work has augmented with each volume; and if the unanimous opinion of the press, uttered from all quarters, be true, which in this instance happens to be the case, it is indeed one of the best of publications. It should be in the possession of every intelligent man, as it is a library in itself, comprising an immense mass of lore upon almost every possible subject, and in the cheapest possible form.” —N. Y. Mirror. “Witnesses from every part of the country concurred in declaring that the Encyclopædia Americana was in a fair way to degrade the dignity of learning, and especially the learning of Encyclopædias, by making it too cheap—that the multitudes of all classes were infatuated with it in saying in so many words from the highest to the lowest, `the more we see of the work the better we like it.”' —N. Y. Courier and Inquirer. “The articles in the present volume appear to us to evince the same ability and research which gained so favorable a reception for the work at its commencement. The Appendix to the volume now before us, containing an account of the Indian Languages of America, must prove highly interesting to the reader in this country; and it is at once remarkable as a specimen of history and philology. The work altogether, we may again be permitted to observe, reflects distinguished credit upon the literary and scientific character, as well as the scholarship of our country.” —Charleston Courier. “The copious information which this work affords on American subjects, fully justifies its title of an American Dictionary; while at the same time the extent, variety, and felicitous disposition of its topics, make it the most convenient and satisfactory Encyclopædia that we have ever seen.” —National Journal. “If the succeeding volumes shall equal in merit the one before us, we may confidently anticipate for the work a reputation and usefulness which ought to secure for it the most flattering encouragement and patronage.” —Federal Gazette. “The variety of topics is of course vast, and they are treated in a manner which is at once so full of information and so interesting, that the work, instead of being merely referred to, might be regularly perused with as much pleasure as profit.” —Baltimore American. “We view it as a publication worthy of the age and of the country, and cannot but believe the discrimination of our countrymen will sustain the publishers, and well reward them for this contribution to American Literature.” —Baltimore Patriot. “It reflects the greatest credit on those who have been concerned in its production, and promises, in a variety of respects, to be the best as well as the most compendious dictionary of the arts, sciences, history, politics, biography, &amp;c. which has yet been compiled. The style of the portion we have read is terse and perspicuous; and it is really curious how so much scientific and other information could have been so satisfactorily-communicated in such brief limits.” —N. Y. Evening Post. “A compendious library, and invaluable book of reference.” —N. Y. American. “Those who can, by any honest modes of economy, reserve the sum of two dollars and fifty cents quarterly, from their family expenses, may pay for this work as fast as it is published; and we confidently believe that they will find at the end that they never purchased so much general, practical, useful information at so cheap a rate.” —Journal of Education. “If the encouragement to the publishers should correspond with the testimony in favor of their enterprise, and the beautiful and faithful style of its execution, the hazard of the undertaking, bold as it was, will be well compensated; and our libraries will be enriched by the most generally useful encyclopedic dictionary that has been offered to the readers of the English language. Full enough for the general scholar, and plain enough for every capacity, it is far more convenient, in every view and form, than its more expensive and ponderous predecessors.” —American Farmer. “The high reputation of the contributors to this work, will not fail to insure it a favorable reception, and its own merits will do the rest.” —Silliman's Journ. “The work will be a valuable possession to every family or individual that can afford to purchase it; and we take pleasure, therefore, in extending the knowledge of its merits.” —National Intelligencer. “The Encylopædia Americana is a prodigious improvement upon all that has gone before it; a thing for our country, as well as the country that have it birth, to be proud of; an inexhaustible treasury of useful, pleasant, and familiar learning on every possible subject, so arranged as to be speedily and safety referred to on emergency, as well as on deliberate inquiry; and better still, adapted to the understanding, and put within the reach of the multitude. * * * The Encyclopædia Americana is a work without which no library worthy of the name can hereafter be made up.” —Yankee. MEDICINE. The PRACTICE of PHYSIC. By W. P. Dewees, M. D., Adjunct Professor of Midwifery, in the University of Pennsylvania. New edition, greatly enlarged, complete in one vol. 8vo. “We have no hesitation in recommending it as decidedly one of the best systems of medicine extant. The tenor of the work in general reflects the highest honor on Dr. Dewees's talents, industry, and capacity for the execution of the arduous task which he had undertaken. It is one of the most able and satisfactory works which modern times have produced, and will be a standard authority.” —London Med. and Surg. Journal, Aug. 1830. DEWEES on the DISEASES of CHILDREN. 5th ed. In 8vo. The objects of this work are, 1st, to teach those who have the charge of children, either as parent or guardian, the most approved methods of securing and improving their physical powers. This is attempted by pointing out the duties which the parent or the guardian owes for this purpose, to this interesting, but helpless class of beings, and the manner by which their duties shall be fulfilled. And 2d, to render available a long experience to these objects of our affection when they become diseased. In attempting this, the author has avoided as much as possible, “technicality;” and has given, if he does not flatter himself too much, to each disease of which he treats, its appropriate and designating characters, with a fidelity that will prevent any two being confounded together, with the best mode of treating them, that either his own experience or that of others has suggested. DEWEES on the DISEASES of FEMALES. 4th edition, with Additions. In 8vo. A COMPENDIOUS SYSTEM OF MIDWIFERY; chiefly designed to facilitate the Inquiries of those who may be pursuing this Branch of Study. By W. P. Dewees, M. D. In 8vo. with 13 Plates.

MANUAL of PATHOLOGY: containing the Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Morbid Character of Diseases, &amp;c. By L. Martinet. Translated, with Notes and Additions, by Jones Quain. Second American Edition, 12mo. We strongly recommend M. Martinet's Manual to the profession, and especially to students; if the latter wish to study diseases to advantage, they should always have it at hand, both when at the bedside of the patient, and when making post mortem examinations.” —American Journal of the Medical Sciences, No. I. CLINICAL ILLUSTRATIONS OF FEVER, comprising a Report of the Cases treated at the London Fever Hospital in 1828-29, by Alexander Tweedie, M. D., Member of the Royal College of Physicians of London, &amp;c. 1 vol. 8vo. “In short, the present work, concise, unostentatious as it is, would have led us to think that Dr. Tweedie was a man of clear judgment, unfettered by attachment to any fashionable hypothesis, that he was an energetic but judicious practitioner, and that, if he did not dazzle his readers with the brilliancy of theoretical speculations he would command their assent to the solidity of his didactic precepts.” —Med. Chir. Journal. AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL SCIENCES. Published Quarterly. And supported by the most distinguished Physicians in the United States, among which are Professors Bigelow, Channing, Chapman, Coxe, De Butts, Dewees, Dickson, Dudley, Francis, Gibson, Hare, Henderson, Horner, Hosack, Jackson, Macneven, Mott, Mussey, Physick, Potter, Sewall, Warren, and Worthington; Drs. Daniell, Drake, Emerson, Fearn, Geddings, Griffith, Hale, Hays, Hayward, Ives, Jackson, Moultrie, Ware, and Wright. It is published punctually on the first of November, February, May, and August. Each No. contains about 280 large 8vo. pages, and one or more plates—being a greater amount of matter than is furnished by any other Medical Journal in the United States. Price $5 per annum. The following Extracts show the estimation in which this Journal is held in Europe:— “Several of the American Journals are before us. * * * * Of these the American Journal of the Medical Sciences is by far the better periodical; it is, indeed, the best of the trans-atlantic medical publications; and, to make a comparison nearer home, is in most respects superior to the great majority of European works of the same description” —The Lancet, Jan. 1831. “We need scarcely refer our esteemed and highly eminent cotemporary, [The American Journal of the Medical Sciences,] from whom we quote, to our critical remarks on the opinions of our own countrymen, or to the principles which influence us in the discharge of our editorial duties.” “Our copious extracts from his unequalled publication, unnoticing multitudes of others which come before us, are the best proof of the esteem which we entertain for his talents and abilities.” —London Medical and Surgical Journal, March, 1830. “The American Journal of the Medical Sciences is one of the most complete and best edited of the numerous periodical publications of the United States.” —Bulletin des Sciences Medicales, Tom. XIV. PATHOLOGICAL and PRACTICAL RESEARCHES on DISEASES of the BRAIN and SPINAL CORD. By John Abercrombie, M.
