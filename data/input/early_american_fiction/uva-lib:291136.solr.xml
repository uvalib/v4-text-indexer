      <field name="fulltext">Boarding School Scenes, OR A FROLIC AMONG THE LAWYERS. CHAPTER I. I was born in Charleston, South Carolina; I had very bad health there in my early childhood, and “My Aunt Betsey,” of whom I have before spoken, took a voyage by sea, from Baltimore to my birth place, for the purpose of returning with me to a climate which the physician had said would strengthen my constitution. She brought me up with the greatest kindness, or rather I should say, she kept me comparatively feeble by her over-care of my health. When I was about fourteen years of age, my father brought my mother and my little sister Virginia, from Charleston to see me. My meeting with my kind mother I shall never forget. She held me at arms' length for an instant, to see if she could recognize, in the chubby boy before her, the puny, sickly child with whom she had parted with such fond regret on board the Caroline but a few years before; and when, in memory and in heart, she recognized each lineament, she clasped me to her bosom with a wild hysteric joy, which compensated her—more than compensated her—she said, for all the agony which our separation had caused her. I loved my mother devotedly, yet I wondered at the emotion which she exhibited at our meeting; and, child though I was, a sense of unworthiness came over me, possibly because my affections could not sound the depth of hers. My father's recognition was kinder than I had expected, from what I remembered of our parting in Charleston. He felt prouder of me than at our parting, I presume, from my improved health and looks, and this made him feel that my being tied to the apron strings of my good old aunt, would not improve my manliness. A gentleman whom he had met at a dinner party, who was the principal of an academy, a kind of miniature college, some thirty miles from Baltimore, had impressed my father, by his disquisitions, with a profound respect for such a mode of education. “William,” said my father, in speaking on the subject to Mr. Stetson, “will be better there than here among the women; he'll be a baby forever here. No, I must make a man of him. I shall take him next week with me, and leave him in charge of Mr. Sears.” My mother insisted upon it that I should stay longer, that she might enjoy my society, and that my sister and myself might become more attached to each other ere they returned to Carolina. But my father said, “No, my dear; you know it was always agreed between us, that you should bring up Virginia as you pleased, and that I would bring up William as I pleased.” “Let us take him, then, back to Charleston,” exclaimed my mother; “he is healthy enough now.” “But he would not be healthy long there, my dear. No, I have made inquiry; Mr. Sears is an admirable man, and under his care, which I am satisfied will be paternal, William will improve his mind, and learn to be a man—will you not, William?” I could only cling to my mother without reply. “Here,” exclaimed my father, exultingly, “you see the effect of his education thus far.” “The effect of his education thus far!” retorted my aunt Betsey, who did not relish my father's remark; “he has been taught to say his prayers, and to love his parents and tell the truth. You see the effects in him now,” and she pointed to me, seated on a stool by my mother. All this made no impression upon my father. He was resolved that I should go to Belle-Air, the country town, situated twenty-four miles from Baltimore, where the school was, the next week, and he so expressed himself decidedly. The condemned criminal, who counts the hours that speed to his execution, scarcely feels more horror at the rush of time than I did. One appalling now seemed to possess me. I was deeply sensitive, and the dread of my loneliness away from all I loved, and the fear of the ridicule and tyranny of the oldsters haunted me so that I could not sleep and I laid awake all night picturing to myself what would be the misery of my situation at Belle-Air. In fact, when the day arrived, I bade my mother, aunt Betsey, and my little sister, Virginia farewell, with scarcely a conciousness, and was placed in the gig by my father, as the stunned criminal is assisted into the fatal cart. This over-sensitiveness—what a curse it is! I lay no claims to genius, and yet I have often thought it hard that I should have the quality which makes the “fatal gift” so dangerous, and not the gift. My little sister, Virginia, who had been my playmate for weeks, cried bitterly when I left her. I dwelt upon her swimming eye with mine, tearless and stony as death. The waters of bitterness had gathered around my heart, but had not yet found an outlet from their icy thrall, 'neath which they flowed dark and deep. Belle-Air, at the time I write of, was a little village of some twenty-five or more houses, six of which were taverns. It was and is a county town, and court was regularly held there, to which the Baltimore lawyers used to flock in crowds; and many mad pranks have I known them to play there for their own amusement, if not for the edification of the pupils of Mr. Sears. My father drew up at McKenny's tavern, and as it was about twelve when we arrived, and the pupils were dismissed to dinner, he sent his card to the principal, who in a few minutes made his appearance. Talk of a lover watching the movements and having impressed upon his memory the image of her whom he loveth!— the school boy has a much more vivid recollection of his teacher. Mr. Sears was a tall, stout man, with broad, stooping shoulders. He carried a large cane, and his step was as decided as ever was Dr. Busby's, who would not take his hat off when the King visited his school, for the reason, as he told his Majesty afterwards, that if his scholars thought that there was a greater man in the Kingdom than himself, he never could control them. The face of Mr. Sears resembled much the likeness of Alexander Hamilton, though his features were more contracted, and his forehead had nothing like the expansion of the great statesman's; yet it projected very similarly at the brows. He welcomed my father to the village with great courtesy, and me to his pupilage with greater dignity. He dined with my father, with me by his side, and every now and then he would pat me on the head and ask me a question. I stammered out monosyllabic answers, when the gentleman would address himself again to his plate with renewed gusto. Mr. Sears recommended my father to board me at the house of a Mr. Hall, who had formerly been the Sheriff of the county, and whose wife and daughters, he said, were very fine women. He regreted, he said, when he first took charge of the academy, that there was not some general place attached to it where the pupils could board in common; but after-reflection had taught him that to board them among the town-people would be as well. He remarked that I was one of his smallest pupils, but that he would look on me in loco parentis, and doubted not that he could make a man of me. After dinner he escorted my father, leading me by the hand, down to the academy, which was on the outskirts of the town, at the other end of it from McKenny's. The buzz, which the usher had not the power to control in the absence of Mr. Sears, hushed instantly in his presence; and as he entered with my father, the pupils all rose, and remained standing until he ordered them to be seated. Giving my father a seat, and placing me in the one which he designed for me in the school, Mr. Sears called several of his most proficient scholars in the different classes, from Homer down to the elements of English, and examined them. When a boy blundered, he darted at him a look which made him shake in his shoes; and when another boy, gave a correct answer, and took his fellow's place, and glanced up for Mr. Sears' smile, it was a picture which my friend Beard, of Cincinnati, would delight to draw. The blunderer looked like one caught in the act of sheep-stealing, while the successful pupil took his place with an air that might have marked one of Napoleon's approved soldiers, when the Emperor had witnessed an act of daring on his part. As for Mr. Sears, he thought Napoleon a common creature to himself. To kill men, he used to say, was much more easy than to instruct them. He felt himself to be like one of the philosophers of old in his academy; and he considered Dr. Parr and Dr. Busby, who boasted that they had whipped every distinguished man in the country, much greater than he of Pharsalia or he of Austerlitz. When the rehearsal of several classes had given my father a due impression of Mr. Sears' great gifts as an instructor, and of his scholars' proficiency, he took my father to Mr. Hall's, to introduce us to my future host. We found the family seated in the long room in which their boarders dined. To Mr. Sears they paid the most profound respect. Well they might, for without his recommendation they would have been without boarders. Hall was a tall, good humored, careless man. His wife was older than himself, tall too, but full of energy. He had two daughters, Harriet and Jane. Harriet was a quick, active, lively girl, and withal pretty; whilst Jane was lolling and lazy in her motions, and without either good looks or smartness. The matter of my boarding was soon arranged, and it had become time for my father to depart. All this while the variety and excitement of the scene had somewhat relieved my feelings, but when my father bade me be a good boy, and drove off, I felt as if the “last link” was indeed broken; and though I made every effort, from a sense of shame, to repress my tears, it was in vain, and they broke forth the wilder from their previous restraint.— Harriet Hall came up instantly to comfort me. She took a seat beside me at the open window at which I was looking out after my father, and with a sweet voice, whose tones are in my memory yet, she told me not to grieve because I was away from my friends; that I should soon see them again, and that she would think I feared they would not be kind to me if I showed so much sorrow. This last remark touched me, and, whilst I was drying my eyes, one of the larger boys, a youth of eighteen or twenty, came up to the window (for the academy by this time had been dismissed for the evening,) and said: “Ah, Miss Harriet, is this another baby crying for home?” In an instant my eyes were dried. I cast one glance at the speaker; he was a tall, slim, reckless looking fellow, named Prettyman; and from that day to this I have neither forgotten it, nor, I fear, forgiven him. In the night, when we retired to our rooms, I found that my bed was in a room with two others, Prettyman and a country bumpkin by the name of Muzzy. As usual on going to bed, I kneeled down to say my prayers, putting my hands up in the attitude of supplication. I had scarcely uttered to myself the first words, “Our Father,” but to the ear that heareth all things, when Prettyman exclaimed: “He's praying! `By the Apostle Paul!' as Richard the Third says, that's against rules. Suppose we cob him, Muzzy?” Muzzy laughed, and got into bed; and I am ashamed to say that I arose with the prayer dying away from my thoughts, and indignation and shame usurping them, and sneaked into bed, where I said my prayers in silence, and wept myself in silence to sleep. In the morning, with a heavy heart, and none but the kind Harriet to comfort me, I betook myself to the academy. Parents little know what a sensitive child suffers at a public school. I verily believe that these schools engender often more treachery, falsehood and cruelty, than exist in West India slavery; I was about saying even in the brains of an abolitionist. Most tenderly nurtured, under thecare of an affectionate old aunt, who was always fixing my clothes to keep me warm, coddling up something nice to pamper me with, watching all my outgoings and in-comings and seeing that everything around me conduced to my convenience and comfort, the contrast was indeed great when I appeared at the Belle-Air academy, one of the smallest boys there, and subjected to the taunts and buffetings of every larger boy than myself in the institution. My father little knew what agony it cost me to be made a man of. I am not certain that the good produced by such academies is equal to their evils. I remember well for two or three nights after Prettyman laughed at me, that I crept into bed to say my prayers, and, at last, under this ridicule—for he practised his gift on me every night—I not only neglected to say them, but began to feel angry toward my Aunt that she had ever taught them to me, as they brought so much contempt on me. Yet, such is the power of conscience, at that tender age, that, when I awoke in the morning of the first night I had not prayed, I felt myself guilty and unworthy, and went into the garden and wept aloud tears of sincere contrition. Too often, in public schools, the first thing a youth learns from his elders, is to laugh at parental authority, and to exhibit to the ridicule of his fellows the letter of advice which his parent or guardian feels it his duty to write to him, taking care, with a jest upon them, to pocket the money they send, with an air of incipient profligacy, which any one may see will soon not only be rank but prurient. Such a moral contagion should be avoided; and I therefore am inclined to think that the Catholic mode of tuition, where some one of the teachers is with the scholars, not only by day but by night, is preferable. And, in fact, any one who has witnessed the respectful familiarity which they teach their pupils to feel and exhibit towards them, and the kindness with which it is met cannot but be impressed with the truth of my remarks. There were nearly one hundred pupils at Belle-Air, at the period of which I write, and the only assistant Mr. Sears had, was a gaunt fellow named Dogberry.— Like his illustrious namesake in Shakspeare, from whom I believe he was a legitimate decendant, he might truly have been “written down an ass.” The boys invented all sorts of annoyances to torture Dogberry withal. A favorite one was, when Mr. Sears was in the city, which was at periods not unfrequent, for them to assemble in the school before Dogberry came, and, setting one by the door to give notice when the usher was within a few feet of it, to begin as soon as he appeared in sight, to shout as with one voice— first “Dog,” and then, after a pause, by way of chorus, “berry,” As soon as notice was given by the watcher, he leaped to his seat, and every tongue was silent, and every eye upon the book before it. The rage of Dogberry knew no bounds on these occasions. He did not like to tell the principal; for the circumstance would have proved not only his want of authority over the boys, but the contempt in which they held him. A trick which Prettyman played him, nearly caused his death, and, luckily for the delinquent, he was never discovered. Dogberry was very penurious, and he saved two-thirds of his salary; as it was not large, he had, of course, to live humbly. He dined at Hall's and took breakfast and supper in his lodgings, if he ever took them, and the quantity of the dinner of which he made himself the receptacle caused it to be doubted. His lodgings were the dormant story of a log cabin, to which he had entrance by a rough flight of stairs without the house and against its side. Under the stairs was a large mud-hole, and Prettyman contrived one gusty night to pull them down, with the intention of calling the usher in the tone of Mr. Sears, (for he was a good mimic,)and causing him to fall in the mud. Unluckily, the usher heard the racket without, and not dreaming it was the fall of the stairs, he leaped from his bed, and hurried out to see what caused it. He fell on them, and though no bones were broken, he was laid up for several weeks. The wind always had the credit of this affair, and Prettyman won great applause for his speedy assistance and sympathy with Dogberry, whom he visited constantly during his confinement. The night of the adjournment of court, the lawyers, and even the judges, had what they called a regular frolic. Mr. Sears was in Baltimore, and the scholars were easily induced to join in it—in fact they wanted no inducement. About twelve o'clock at night we were aroused from our beds by a most awful yelling for the ex-sheriff. “Hall! Hall!” was the cry. Soon the door was opened, and the trampling of feet was heard—in a minute the frolickers ascended the stairs, and one of the judges, with a blanket wrapped round him, like an Indian, with his face painted and a red handkerchief tied round his head, and with red slippers on, entered our room, with a candle in one hand and a bottle in the other; and, after making us drink all round, bade us get up. We were nothing loath. On descending into the dining-room, lo! there were the whole bar, dressed off in the most fantastic style, and some of them scarcely dressed at all. They were mad with fun and wine. The ex-sheriff brought forth his liquors, and was placed on his own table a culprit, and tried and found guilty of not having been, as in duty bound, one of the originators of the frolic. He was, therefore, fined glasses round for the company, and ordered by the judges to pay it at Richardson's bar. To Richardson's the order was given to repair. Accordingly, they formed a line without, Indian file. Two large black women carried a light in each hand beside the first judge, and two smaller black women carried a light in their right hands beside the next one. The lawyers followed, each with a light in his hand, and the procession closed with the scholars, who each also bore a light. I, being smallest, brought up the rear. There was neither man nor boy who was not more or less intoxicated, and the wildest pranks were played. When we reached Dogberry's domicil, one of the boys proposed to have him out with us. The question was put by one of the judges and carried by unanimous acclamation. It was further resolved, that a deputation of three, each bearing a bottle of different liquor, should be appointed to wait on him, with the request that he would visit the Pawnee tribe, from the far West, drink some fire-water with them, and smoke the pipe of peace. Prettyman, whose recklessness knew no bounds, and who, as I suppose, wished to involve me in difficulty, moved that the smallest and tallest person in the council be of that deputation. There happened to be by Dogberry's a quantity of logs, which had been gathered there for the purpose of building a log house. Mr. Patterson, (I use here a fictitious name) was at this time the great lawyer of Maryland. He was dressed in a splendid Indian costume, which a Western client had given him, and he had painted himself with care and taste. He was a fine looking man, and stretching out his hand, he exclaimed— “Brothers, be seated; but not on the prostrate forms of the forest, which the ruthless white man has felled to make unto himself a habitation. Like the big warrior, Tecumseh, in council with the great white chief, Harrison, we will sit upon the lap of our mother, the earth—upon her breast we will sleep—the Pawnee has no roof but the blue sky, where dwelleth the Great Spirit—and he looks up to the shining stars, and they look down upon him—and they count the leaves of the forest and know the might of the Pawnees.” Every one, by this time, had taken a seat upon the ground, and all were silent. As the lights flashed over the group, they formed as grotesque a scene as I have ever witnessed. “Brothers,” he continued, “those eyes of the Great Spirit,”—pointing upward to the stars—“behold the rushing river, and they say to our fathers, who are in the happy hunting grounds of the blest, that, like it, is the might of the Pawnee when he rushes to battle. The white men are dogs—their carcasses drift in the tide—they are cast out on the shore, and the prairie-wolf fattens on them. “Brothers: the eyes of the Great Spirit behold the prairies and the forest, where the breath of the wintry wind bears the red fire through them—where the prairie-wolf flies and the fire flies faster. Brothers, the white man is the prairie-wolf, and the Pawnee is the fire. “Brothers: when the forked fire from the right arm of the Great Spirit smites the mountain's brow, the eagle soars upward to his home in the clouds, but the snake crawls over the bare rock in the blast, and hides in the clefts and hollows and holes. Behold! the forked fire strikes the rock and scatters it as the big warrior would throw pebbles from his hand, and the soaring eagle darts from the clouds and the death-rattle of the snake is heard, and he hisses no more. “Brothers: the Pawnee is the eagle, the bird of the Great Spirit, and the white man is the crawling snake that the Great Spirit hates. “Brothers: the shining eyes of the Great Spirit see all these things, and tell them to our fathers, who are in the happy hunting grounds of the blest, and they say that some day, wrapped in the clouds, they will come and see us, for our land is like theirs.” This was said with so much eloquence by the distinguished lawyer, that there was the silence of nearly a minute when he concluded. In the company was a lawyer named Short, who, strange to say, was just six feet three inches and a half high, and he had a client— which is stranger still—named Long, who was but five feet high. “Who has precedence, Judge Williard?” called out some one in the crowd, breaking in upon the business of the occasion, as upon such occasions business always will be broken in upon—“who has precedence, Long or Short?” “Long,” exclaimed the judge, “of course. It is a settled rule in law, that you must take as much land as is called for in the deed—therefore, Long takes precedence of Short. May be, Short has a remedy in equity; but this court has nothing to do with that— so you have the long and the short of the matter.” “Judge,” cried out the ex-sheriff, “we must go to Richardson's—you know it is my treat.” “The Pawnee, the eagle of his race,” exclaimed Patterson, “the prophet of his tribe; he who is more than warrior—whose tongue is clothed with the Great Spirit's thunder—who can speak with the eloquence of the spring air when it whispers amidst the leaves and makes the flowers open and give forth their sweets— he, the Charming Serpent, that hath a tongue forked with persuasion—he, even he, will go unto the white man, and invite him to come forth and taste the fire-water, and smoke the pipe of peace with the Pawnee. Then, if he comes not forth when the Charming Serpent takes him by the hand and bids him, the Pawnees shall smoke him out like a fox, and his blazing habitation shall make night pale, and there shall be no resting place for his foot, and children and squaws shall whip him into the forest, and set dogs upon his trail, and he shall be hunted from hill to hill, from river to river, from prairie to prairie, from forest to forest, till, like the frightened deer, he rushes, panting, into the great lakes, and the waters rise over him, and cover him from the Pawnee's scorn.” This was received with acclamation. Mr. Patterson played the Indian so well that he drew me one of the closest to him in the charmed circle that surrounded him. His eye flashed, his lips quivered with fiery ardor, though but in a mimic scene. He would have made a great actor. I was so lost in admiration of him, that I placed myself beside him without knowing it. He saw the effect he had produced upon me, and was evidently gratified. Taking me by the hand, he said— “Warriors and braves: give unto me the brand, that the Charming Serpent may light the steps of the boy to the hiding place of the pale-face. He shall listen to the eloquence of the Charming Serpent when he takes the white man by the hand—he shall learn to move alike the heart of the pale-face and the red-man. “Brothers: the Charming Serpent to-night,” said he` handing me the candle, and placing himself in an oratorial attitude, while every man lifted up his candle so that it shone full upon him—“Brothers, the Charming Serpent to-night could speak unto the four winds that are now howling in the desolate Pawnee paths of the wilderness, and make them sink into a low moan, and sigh themselves to silence, were he to tell them of the many of his tribe who are now lying mangled, unburied, and cold, beneath the shadow of the Rocky Mountains—victims of the white man's treacherous cruelty. “Brothers: O! that the Great Spirit would give the Charming Serpent his voice of thunder—then would he stand upon the highest peak of the Alleghanies, with the forked lightening in his red right hand, and tell a listening and heart-struck world the wrongs of his race. And, when all of every tribe of every people had come crouching in the valleys, and had filled up the gorges of the hills, then would the Charming Serpent hurl vengeance on the oppressor. But come,” said he, taking the candle in one hand, and myself in the other, “the Pawnee talks like a squaw. The Charming Serpent will speak with the pale-face, and lead him forth from his wigwam to the great council fire.” CHAPTER II. Accordingly, the Charming Serpent holding me by the hand, led me up the stairs. His steps were steady. It was evident that his libations had excited his brain, and instead of weakening him, gave him strength. What's your name?” said he to me kindly “William Russell, sir.” “Do you know me, my little fellow?” “Yes sir, you're Mr. Patterson, the great lawyer.” “Ah, Ha! they call me the great lawyer! What else do they say?” “That you're the greatest orator in the country,” I replied—for what I had drank made me bold, too. “They do—I know they do, my little fellow—I believe, in fact, that I could have stood up in the Areopagus of old, in favor of human rights, and faced the best of them. Yes, sir, I too could have fulmined over Greece. But we are not Grecians now—we are Pawnees.” “Stop, stop, Mr. Pawnee,” called out some one from the crowd, “Short was to go, he is the tallest man.” “The tallest man,” re-echoed Mr. Patterson, speaking in his natural tone. “The judge, sir, has already decided that by just legal construction, Short is short, no matter how long he is; and, if he claims to be long, sir, I can just inform him that Lord Bacon says `that tall men are like tall houses, the upper story is the worst furnished:” Here every eye was turned on Short, and there was a shout of laughter. “If,” continued Mr. Patterson—and it was evident his potations were doing their work—“if it be true—I'll just say this to you, sir: Dr. Watts was a very small man, and he said and I repeat it of all small men— “Had I the height to reach the pole Or mete the ocean with my span, I would be measured by my soul— The mind's the standard of the man.” “There, gentlemen of the jury; if that be true, I opine that the tallest man in the crowd is addressing you. But, I forget, I am a Pawnee.” “Brothers: The tall grass of the prairies is swept by 2 the fire, while the flint endureth the flames of the stake. The loftiest trees of the forest snap like a reed in the whirlwind, and the bird that builds there leaves her eggs unhatched. The highest peak of the mountain is always the bleakest and barest—in the valley are the sweet waters and the pleasant places. Damn it,” said he, speaking in his proper person, for he began to forget his personation, “why do we value the gem— `Ask why God made the gem so small, And why so huge the granite? Because he meant mankind should set The higher value on it.' “That's Burns, an illustrious name, gentlemen.— When I was minister abroad, I stood beside the peasant-poet's grave, and thanked God that he had given me the faculties to appreciate him. Suppose that he had been born in this land of ours, sirs, all we who think ourselves lights in law and statesmanship would have seen our stars paled—paled, sirs, as the fire of the prairie grows dim when the eye of the great spirit looks forth from the eastern gates—damn it, that's Ossian and not Pawnee—upon it in its fierceness. `Thou the bright eye of the universe, That openest over all, and unto all Art a delight—thou shinest not on my soul.' That's Byron—I know him well—handsome fellow. `Thou shinest not on my soul'—no but thou shinest on the prairie.” “The usher!—Dogberry—let's have Dogberry!” called out several of the students. “Ha!” exclaimed Mr. Patterson, “Dogberry!” He's Goldsmith's village teacher, that caused the wonder— “That one small head could carry all he knew.' Dogberry!—Dogberry?—but that sounds Shaksperian. `Reading and writing come by nature.' Those certainly are not his sentiments. I mean the defendant's —were they, he should throw away the usher's rod and betake himself to something else; for if these things come by nature, then is Dogberry's occupation gone. Yes, he had better betake himself to the constableship —the night watch. Come my little friend—come, son of the Pawnee, and we will arouse the pale face.” Obeying Mr. Patterson, we ascended to the little platform in front of Dogberry's door, at which he rapped three times distinetly. “Who's there?” cried out a voice from within. Dogberry must of course have been awake for at least half an hour. “Pale-face,” said the Pawnee chief. “Thou hast not followed the example of the great chief of the pale-faces; the string of thy latch is pulled in. Upon my word, this is certainly the attic story,” he continued in a low voice—“are you attic too Dogberry?” “No sir I am rheumatic—gentleman, unless your business be pressing”— “Pressing! Pale-face, the Pawnees have lit their council fire, and invite thee to drink with them the fire-water, and smoke the pipe of peace.” “Thank you, gentlemen, I never drink,” responded Dogberry, in an impatient tone. “Never drink! Pale-face, thou liest! Who made the fire-water, and gave it to my people, but thee and thine? Lo! before it, though they once covered the land, they have melted away like snow beneath the sun.” “I belong to the temperance society,” cried out Dogberry from within. “Dogberry,” exclaimed Patterson —whose patience, like that of the crowd below, who were calling for the usher as if they were at a town meeting and expected him to speak, was becoming exhausted—“Dogberry, compel me not, as your great name-sake would say, to commit either `perjury' or `burglary,' and break your door open. You remember in Marmion, Dogberry, that the chief, speaking of the insult which had been put upon him, said: “I'll right such wrongs where'er they're given, Though in the very court of Heaven.” Now I will not say that I would make you drink wherever the old chief would `right his wrongs,' but this I will say, that whenever I, Burbage Patterson, get drunk, I think you can come forth and take a stirrup cup with him: he leaves for the Supreme Court to-morrow, to encounter the giant of the North.” “Mr. Patterson,” said Dogberry, coming towards the door, “your character can stand it—it can stand anything—mine can't.” “There's truth in that,” said Mr. Patterson aside to me. “Gentlemen, let us leave the pedagogue to his reflection; and now it occurs to me that we had better not uncage him, for, boys, he would be a witness against you; more, witness, judge, jury, and executioner—by the by, clear against law. Were I in your place, I would appeal, and for every stripe he gives you, should the judgment be reversed, do you give him two.” Here a sprightly fellow, one of the scholars, named Morris, from Long Green, ran up the steps and said to Mr. Patterson: “Do, sir, have him out, for if we get him into the frolic too, we are as safe, sir, as if we were all in our beds. He has seen us all through some infernal crack or other.” “Ah,” exclaimed Mr. Patterson in a low tone to Morris, “he has been playing Cowper, has he—“looking from the loop holes of retreat, seeing the Babel and not feeling the stir.” “Yes, sir, but he'll make a stir about it to-morrow.” “He shall come forth, then,” said Mr. Patterson; “Dogberry, open the door; they speak of removing Sears, and why don't you come forth and greet your friends? We have an idea of getting the appointment for you.” This flattery took instant effect, for we heard Dogberry bustling to the door, and in a moment it was opened about half way, and the usher put his head out, and said, but with evident wish that his invitation would be refused, “Will you come in, sir?—Why William Russell!” to me in surprise. “Pale-face, this is a youthful brave to whom I want the pale-face to teach the arts of his race. Behold! I am the Charming Serpent. Come forth and taste of the fire-water.” As Mr. Patterson spoke, he took Dogberry by the hand and pulled him on the platform. The usher was greeted with loud acclamations and laughter by the crowd. He, however, did not relish it, and was frightened out of his wits. He really looked the personification of a caricature. His head was covered with an old flannel night cap, notwithstanding it was warm weather, and his trowsers were held up by his hips, while his suspenders dangled about his knees. On his right leg he had an old boot, and on his left foot an old shoe; he was without coat or vest. As Mr. Patterson held up the light so that the crowd below could see him, there was such a yelling as had not been heard on the spot since those whose characters the crowd were assuming had left it. Dogberry hastily withdrew into his room, but followed by Mr. Patterson and myself, each bearing a light.— When we entered, the crowd rushed up the steps. “For God's sake, sir, for the sake of my character and situation, don't let them come in here.” “They shall not if you will promise to drink with me Pale face, speak, will you drink with the Pawnee?” “Yes, sir,” said Dogberry faintly. The Charming Serpent here went to the door, and said: “Brothers, the Charming Serpent would hold a private talk with the chief of the pale faces. Ere long, he will be with you. Let the Big Bull (one of the lawyers was named Bull, and he was very humorous.) pass round the fire water and the calumet, and by that time the Charming Serpent will come forth. Brothers, give unto the Charming Serpent some of the fire water that he may work his spells.” A dozen handed up bottles of different wines and liquors. The Charming Serpent gave Dogberry the candles to hold, took a bottle of Champagne and handed me another. Then shutting the door he said: “This is the fire-water that hath no evil in it. It courses through the veins like a silvery lake through the prairie, where the wild grass waves green and glorious, and it makes the heart merry like the merriment of birds in the spring time, and not with the fierce fires of the dark lake, like the strong fire-water that glows red as the living coal. Brothers, we will drink.” Dogberry's apartment was indeed an humble one. Only in the centre of it could you stand upright. Over our heads were the rafters and bare shingles, formed exactly in the shape of the capitalletter Vinverted. Opposite the door was a little window of four panes of glass, and under it, or rather beside it, in the corner, was a little beadstead, with a straw mattress upon it. A small table, with a tumbler and broken pitcher and candle in a tin candle-stick on it, stood opposite the bed. A board nailed across from rafter to rafter, held a few books, and beside it on nails, were several articles of clothing. There were besides in the apartment two chairs, and a wooden chest in the corner by the door. “Come, drink, my old boy,” exclaimed Patterson. “Thank you, Mr. Patterson, your character can stand it, I tell you, but mine can't.” “Friend of my soul, this goblet sip,” reiterated Patterson, offering Dogberry the glass. “Thank you Mr. Patterson, I would not choose any,” said he. “You can't but choose, Dogberry; there is no alternative. Do you remember what the poet beautifully says of the Roman daughter, who sustained her imprisoned father from her own breast? `Drink, drink, and live, old man; Heaven's realm holds no such tide.' Do you remember it? I bid you drink, then, and I say to you Hebe, nor Ganymede never offered to the immortals purer wine than that; I imported it for my own use. Drink! here's to you, Dogberry, and to your speedy promotion;” and Mr. Patterson swallowed every drop in the glass, and, refilling it, handed it to the usher. “How do you like the letter, Mr. Dogberry?” asked Mr. Patterson of the pedagogue. “What letter, sir? Mr. Patterson, I must say this is a strange proceeding. I don't know, sir, to what you allude.” “Don't know to what I allude! Why, the letter wishing to know if you would take the academy at the same price at which Sears now holds it.” “Sir, I have no such letter. I certainly, sir, would, if it was thought that I was—” “Was competent. Merit is always modest; you're the most competent of the two, sir,—take some.” So saying, Mr. Patterson filled up the tumbler, and Dogberry swallowed the compliment and the wine together, and fixed his eye on the rafters with an exulting look. While he was so gazing, the lawyer filled his glass, and observed, “Come, drink, and let me open this other bottle; I want a glass myself.” Down went the wine, and with a smack of his lips, Dogberry handed the glass to Mr. Patterson. “Capital, ain't it, eh?” “Capital,” re-echoed Dogberry. The wine and his supposed honors had roused the brain of the pedagogue in a manner which seemed to awake him to a new existence. While Mr. Patterson was striking the top from the other bottle, Dogberry handed me the candle which he held—the other he had put in his candle-stick, taking out his own candle when he first drank— and lifting the tumbler, he stood ready. Again he quaffed a bumper. The effect of these potations on him was electrical. He had a long face, with a snipe-like nose, which was subject to a nervous twitching whenever its owner was excited. It now danced about, seemingly, all over his face, while his naturally cadaverous countenance, under the excitement, turned to a glowing red, and his small ferret eyes looked both dignified and dancing, merry and important. “So,” he exclaimed, “I am to be principal of the academy; ha, ha, ha! oh, Lord! William Russel, I would reprove you on the spot, but that you are in such distinguished company.” Whether Dogberry meant only Mr. Patterson, or included himself, I do not know, but as he spoke he arose, and paced his apartment with a proud tread, forgetting what a figure he cut, with his suspenders dangling about his knees and his night cap on, and forgetting also that his attic was not high enough to admit his head to be carried at its present altitude. The consequence was that he stuck it against one of the rafters, with a violence that threatened injury to the rafter, if not to the head. He stooped down and rubbed the affected part, when Mr. Patterson said to him, “Pro-di-gi-ous,” as Dominie Sampson, one of you, said, ain't it? Hang Franklin's notion about stooping in this world. Come, we'll finish this bottle, and then go forth. The scholars are all rejoiced at your promotion, and are all assembled without to do you honor. They have made a complete saturnalia of it. They marvel why you treat them with so much reserve.” “Gad, I'll do it,” exclaimed Dogberry, taking the tumbler and swallowing the contents. “Just put your blanket around you,” said Patterson to him, “and let your night-cap remain; it becomes you.” “No, it don't indeed, though eh?” “It does, 'pon honor. That's it. Now, pale face, come forth; the eloquence of the Charming Serpent has prevailed.” So speaking, Mr. Patterson opened the door, and we stepped on to the platform. The scene without was grotesque in the extreme. In front of us, I suppose to the number of a hundred persons, were the frolickers, composed of lawyers, students, and town's people, all seated in a circle; while Mr. Paterson's client from the West, dressed in costume, was giving the Pawnee war-dance. This client was a rough, uneducated man, but full of originality and whim. Mr. Patterson had gained a suit for him, in which the title to an estate in the neighborhood was involved, worth upwards of sixty thousand dollars. The whole bar had believed that the suit could not be sustained by Patterson, but his luminous mind had detected the clue through the labyrinths of litigation, where they saw nothing but confusion and defeat. His client was overjoyed at the result, as every one had croaked defeat to him. He gave Mr. Patterson fifteen thousand dollars, five more than he had promised, and had made him a present of the splendid Indian dress in which, as a bit of fun, before the frolic commenced, he had decked himself, under the supervision of his client, who acted as his costumer, and afterwards dressed himself in the same way. The client had a great many Indian dresses with him, which he had collected with great care, and on this occasion he had thrown open his trunks and supplied nearly the whole bar. The name of Mr. Patterson's client was Blackwood, and the admiration which he excited seemed to give him no little pleasure. Most of the lawyers in the circle had something Indian on them, while the boys, who could not appear in costume, and were determined to appear wild, had turned their jackets wrong side out, and swapped with each other, the big ones with the little, so that one wore his neighbor's jacket, the waist of which came up under his arms, and exhibited the back of his vest, while the other wore a coat, the hip buttons of which were at his knees. On the outskirts of this motley assembly could be seen, here and there, a negro, who might be said at once to contribute to the darkness that surrounded the scene and to reflect light upon it; for their black skins were as ebon as night, while their broad grins certainly had something luminous about them, as their white teeth shone forth. We stood about a minute admiring the dance, when it was concluded, some one espied us, and pointed us out to the rest. We, or rather, I should say, Dogberry, was greeted with three times three. I have never seen, for the size of the assembly, such an uproarious outbreak of bacchanalian merriment. After the cheers were given, many of the boys threw themselves on the grass and rolled over and over, shouting as they rolled. Others jerked their fellow's hats off, and hurled them in the air. Prettyman stood with his arms folded, as if he did not know what to make of it, and then, deliberately spreading his blanket on the ground, he deliberately took a seat in the centre of it, and, like an amateur at play, enjoyed the scene. Morris held his sides, stooped down his head, and glanced sideways cunningly at Dogberry, throwing his head back every now and then with a sudden jerk, while loud explosive bursts of laughter, from his very heart, echoed through the village above every other sound. “A speech from Dogberry!” exclaimed Prettyman. “Ay, a speech!” shouted Morris, “a speech!” “No, gentlemen, not now,” exclaimed Richardson, the proprietor of one of the hotels; “I sent down to my house an hour ago, and have had a collation served. Mr. Patterson, and gentlemen and students all, I invite you to partake with me.” “Silence!” called out Mr. Patterson. All were silent. “Students of the Belle-Air academy and citizens generally, I have the honor to announce to you that my friend, Mr. Dogberry, is about to supercede Mr. Sears. We must form a procession and place him in our midst, the post of honor, and then to mine host's.” So speaking, Mr. Patterson descended, followed by Dogberry and myself. The students gave their candles to the negroes to hold, joined their hands, and danced round Dogberry with the wildest glee, while he received it all in drunken dignity. When I have seen since, in Chapman's floating theatre, or in a barn or shed in the far West, some lubberly, drunken son of the sock and buskin enact Macbeth, with the witches about him, I have recalled this scene, and thought that the boys looked like the witches, and Dogberry like the Thane, when the witches greet him: `All hail, Macbeth, that shall be King hereafter!' The procession was at length formed. Surrounded by the boys, who rent the air with shouts, with his night-cap on his head and his blanket around him, with one boot and one shoe, Dogberry, following immediately after the judges, proceeded with them to Richardson's hotel. Whenever there was the silence of a minute or two, some boy or other would ask Dogberry not to remember on the morrow that he saw them out that night.” “No, boys, no; certainly not; this thing, I understand, is done in honor of me—I shan't take Sears in even as an assistant. Boys, he has not used me well.” We arrived at Richardson's as well as we could, having business on both sides of the street. His dining room was a very large one, and he had a very fine collation set out, with plenty of wines and other liquors.— Judge Willard took the head of the table, and Judge Noland the foot. Dogberry was to the right of Judge Willard, and Mr. Patterson to the left. He made me sit beside him. The eating was soon despatched, and it silenced us all a little, while it laid the ground work for standing another supply of wine, which was soon sparkling in our glasses, and we were now all more excited than ever. It was amusing to see the merry faces of my schoolmates twinkling about among the crowd, trying to catch and comprehend whatever was said by the lawyers, particularly those that were distinguished. Songs were sung, sentiments given, and Indian talks held by the quantity. Dogberry looked the while first at the boys, and then at the lawyers, and then at himself, not knowing whether or not the scene before him was a reality or a dream. The great respect which the boys showed him, and Patterson making an occasional remark to him, seemed at least not only fully to impress him with the reality, but also with a full, if not a sober conviction of his own importance. “A song!—a song!” was shouted by a dozen of the larger students; “a song from Morris. Give us `Down with the pedagogue Sears.' Hurrah for old Dogberry! Dogberry forever!” “No,” cried out others, “a speech from Mr. Patterson—no, from the Pawnee You're finable for not speaking in character.” Here Prettyman took Mr. Patterson courteously by the hand, and said something to him in a whisper. “Ah ha!” exclaimed Mr. Patterson, “so it shall be; I like Morris. Come, my good fellow, sing us the song you wrote; come, Dogberry's Star is now in the ascendant. `Down with the pedagogue Sears'—let's have it. Nothing loth, Morris was placed on the table, while the students gathered round him, ready to join the chorus. Taking a preparatory glass of wine, while Mr. Patterson rapped on the table by way of commanding silence. Morris placed himself in an attitude and sang the following which he had written on some rebellious occasion or other: SONG. You may talk of the sway of imperial power, And tell how its subjects must fawn, cringe, and cower, And offer the incense of tears; But I tell you at once that there's none can compare With the tyrant that rules o'er the lads of Belle-air: So down with the pedagogue Sears. [Chorus.] Down, down, So down with the pedagogue Sears. Down, down, etc. The serf has his Sunday: the negroes tell o'er Their Christmas the Fourth, ay, and many days more, When they feel themselves fully our peers; But we're tasked night and day by the line and the rule, And Sunday's no Sunday for there's Sunday school; So down with the pedagogue Sears, [Chorus.] Down, down, So down with the pedagogue Sears. So here's to the lad who can talk to his lass, And here's to the lad who can take down his glass, And is only a lad in his years: Who can stand up and act a bold part like a man, And do just whatever another man can; So down with the pedagogue Sears. [CHORUS.] Down, down, So down with the pedagogue Sears. Down, down, &amp;c. “Hip, hip, hurrah—once more,” shouted Morris. “Now then”— While the whole room was in uproarious chorussing, who should enter but Sears himself. He looked round with stern dignity and surprise, at first uncertain on whom to fix his indignation, when his eye lit on Dogberry, who, the most elated and inebriated of all, was flourishing his night cap over his head, and shouting at the top of his voice: “Down with the pedagogue Sears.” As soon as Sears caught a view of Dogberry, he advanced towards him, as if determined to inflict personal chastisement on the usher. At first Dogberry again prepared to vociferate the chorus, but when he met the eye of Sears his voice failed him, and he moved hastily towards Mr. Patterson, who slapped him on the shoulders, and cried out, “Dogberry, be true to yourself.” “I am true to myself. Yes, my old boy, old Sears, you're no longer head devil at Belle-air Academy.— You're no devil at all, or if you are, old boy, you're a poor devil, and be d—d to you.” “You're a drunken out-cast, sir,” exclaimed Sears. “Never let me see your face again; I dismiss you from my service from Belle-air Academy” and so speaking, he took a note book from his pocket, and began hastily to take down the names of the students. The Big Bull saw this, and caught it from his hand. “Sir, sir,” exclaimed Sears, enraged, “my vocation, and not any respect I bear you, prevents my infliction of personal chastisement upon you. Boys, young gentlemen, leave instantly for your respective boarding houses.” During this, Patterson was clapping Dogberry on the shoulder, evidently to inspire him with courage. “Tell him yourself,” I overheard Dogberry say. “No, no,” replied Patterson, “it is your place.” “Well, then, I'll tell you at once, Sears: you're no longer principal of this academy; you're dished. Mr. Patterson, sir, will tell you so.” “Mr. Patterson!” exclaimed Sears, for the first time recognizing, in the semblance of the Indian chief, the distinguished lawyer and statesman. “Sir, I am more than astonished.” “Sir,” rejoined Patterson, drawing himself up with dignity, “I am a Pawnee brave; more, a red-man eloquent, or a pale-face eloquent, as it pleases me; but, sir, under all circumstances, I respect your craft and calling. What more dignified than such! A poor, unfriended boy, I was taken by the hand by an humble teacher of a country school, and here I stand, let me say, sir, high in the councils of a great people, a leader among leaders in the senate hall of nations— and I owe it to him. Peace to old Playfair's ashes The old philosopher, like Porson, loved his cups, and, like Parr, loved his pipe; but, sir, he was a ripe scholar and a noble spirit, and I have so said, sir, in the humble monument which I am proud, sir, I was enabled, through the education he gave me, to build over him; `After life's fitful fever, he sleeps well.' Yes, as some one says, he was `my friend before had flatterers.' How proud he was of me! I remember well catching his eye in making my first speech, and the approving nod he gave me had more gratification to me than the approbation of bench, bar, and audience. Glorious old Playfair! Mr. Sears, you were his pupil too. Many a time have I heard him speak of you; he said, of all his pupils you were the one to wear his mantle. And, sir, that was the highest compliment he could pay you—the highest, Mr. Speaker, for he esteemed himself of the class of the philosophers, the teachers of youth. Sir, Mr. Sears, I propose to you that, in testimony of our life-long respect for him, we drink to his memory.” This was said so eloquently, and withal so naturally, that Sears, forgetful of his whereabouts, took the glass which Mr. Patterson offered him, and drank its contents reverently to the memory of his old teacher. “Sir,” resumed Patterson, “how glorious is your vocation! But, tell me, do you subscribe to the sentiments of Don Juan? `O, ye! who teach the ingenuous youth of nations, Holland, France, England, Germany, or Spain, I pray ye flog them upon all occasions— It mends their morals—never mind the pain.”' The appropriate quotation caused a thrill to run through the assembled students, while they cast ominous looks at each other. For the life of him, Sears could not resist a smile. At this Mr. Patterson glanced at us with a quiet meaning, and, turning to Mr. Sears, he continued: “The elder Adams taught school—he whose eloquence Jefferson has so loudly lauded—the man who was for liberty or death, and so expressed himself in that beautiful letter to his wife. Do you not remember that passage, sir, where he speaks of the Fourth being greeted thereafter with bon-fires and illuminations? His son, Johnny Q. taught school. My dark-eyed friend Webster, who is now figuring so gloriously in the halls of Congress and in the Supreme Court and whom I meet to-morrow, taught school. Judge Rowan, of Kentucky, a master spirit too, taught school. Who was that `Who passed the flaming bounds of time and space, The living throne, the sapphire blaze, Where angels tremble as they gaze: Who saw, but, blasted with excess of light, Closed his eyes in endless night—' Who was he? Milton—the glorious, the sublime,— who, in his aspirations for human liberty, prayed to that great Spirit who, as he himself says, `sends forth the fire from his altar to touch and purify the lips of whom he pleaseth'—Milton, the school-master. `If fallen in evil days on evil tongues, Milton appealed to the avenger, Time: 3 If Time, the avenger, execrates his wrongs, And makes the word `Miltonic' mean `sublime,' He deigned not to belie his soul in songs, Nor turn his very talent to a crime; He did not loath the sire to laud the son, But closed the tyraut-hater he begun. `Think'st thou, could he—the blind old man—arise, Like Samuel, from the grave, to freeze once more The blood of monarchs with his prophecies, Or be alive again—again all hoar, With time and trials, and those helpless eyes And heartless daughters, worn, and pale, and poor'— Would he not be proud of his vocation, when he reflected how many great spirits had followed his example? The school-master is indeed abroad. Mr. Sears, let us drink the health of the blind old man eloquent.” “Thank you, thank you, Mr. Patterson, but before my scholars, under the circumstances, it would be setting a bad example, when existing circumstances prove they need a good one. Sir, it was thought that I should not return from Baltimore until to-morrow, and this advantage has been taken of my absence. But, Mr. Patterson, when such distinguished gentlemen as yourself set the example, I know not what to say.” “Forgive them, sir, forgive them,” said Mr. Patterson, in his blandest tone. “Let them repair to their homes, then, instantly. Mr. Patterson, your eloquent conversation has made me forget myself; I don't wonder they should have forgotten themselves. Let them depart.” “There, boys,” exclaimed Mr. Patterson, “I have a greater opinion of my oratorical powers than ever. Be ye all dismissed until I again appear as a Pawnee brave, which I fear will be a long time, for 'tis not every day that such men as my western client are picked up. But, Mr. Sears, what do you say about Dogberry? He must be where he was; to morrow must type yesterday. Dogberry, how is Verges?” “I don't know him,” said Dogberry, doggedly. “Why, sir, he is the associate of your name-sake in Shakspeare's immortal page. Let this play to-night, Mr. Sears, be like that in which Dogberry's name-sake appeared—let it be `Much ado about Nothing.”' Sears smiled and nodded his head approvingly. “Then be the court adjourned,” exclaimed Mr. Patterson. “Dogberry, you and my friend Sears are still together, and you must remember in the premises what your name-sake said to Verges, `An two men ride of a horse, one man must ride behind.”' Giving three cheers for Mr. Patterson, we boys separated, and the next day found us betimes in the academy, where mum was the word between all parties.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE UNSUMMONED WITNESS. PART FIRST. Some years since, when I was in the practice of the law, one morning, just after I had entered my office— I was then an invalid on two crutches and not a very early riser, so what clients I had, were often there before me—some few moments after I had ensconced myself in my chair with my crutches before me, like monitors of mortality, I heard a timid rap at my door. Notwithstanding I called out in a loud voice, “come in,” the visitor, though the rap was not repeated after I spoke, still hung back. With feelings of impatience and pain, I arose, adjusted my crutches under my arms, and muttering, not inaudibly, my discontent, I hobbled to the door and jerked it open. The moment the visitor was presented to my vision, I felt angry with myself for what I had done, and the feeling was not relieved, when a meek and grief-subdued voice said, “I am very sorry to disturb you, sir.” “No,” said I politely, for it was a young and beautiful woman, or rather girl, of certainly not more than sixteen, who stood before me, “I am sorry that you should have waited so long. Come in, I am lame as you see, Miss, and could not sooner get to the door.” Adjusting her shawl, which was pinned closely up to her neck, as she passed the threshold, she entered, and at my request, but not until I had myself resumed my seat, took a chair. I observed it was a fine morning, to which she made no reply, for she was evidently abstracted, or rather embarrassed, not knowing how to open the purpose of her visit. The few moments we sat in silence, I occupied in observing her. She had, I thought, arrayed herself in her best clothes, anxious by so doing to make a respectable appearance before her lawyer, and thereby convince him that if she could not at present compass his fee, he could have no doubt of it eventually; though it was also apparent to me that in the flurry of mind attendant upon her visit and its consequence, she had not thought at all of adding to her personal attractions by so doing. That consideration not often absent from a woman's mind, had by some absorbing event been banished from hers. She wore a black silk gown, the better days of which had gone, perhaps, with the wearer's. Her timid step, had not prevented my seeing a remarkably delicate foot, encased in a morocco shoe much worn and patched, evidently by an unskilful hand—I thought her own. And though when she took a seat, she folded her arms closely up under her shawl, which was a small one, of red merino, and, as I have said, pinned closely to her neck, it did not prevent my observing that her hand, though small, was gloveless, and that a ring—I thought an ominous looking ring—we catch fancies we know not why or wherfore—begirt one of her fingers. In fact when she first placed her hands under the shawl, she turned the ring upon her finger, may be unconsciously On her head she wore a calash bonnet, and as I again interrupted the silence by asking, “Is it the law you seek so early, Miss?” She drew her hand from beneath her shawl, and removing her bonnet partly from her face so as to answer me, she revealed as fair and as facinating features as I ever remember to have seen. Her hair was parted carelessly back over a snowy forehead, beneath which, lustrous eyes black as death and almost as melancholy, looked forth from the shadow of a weeping-willow-like lash. A faint attempt to smile at my question discovered beautiful teeth, and I thought, as she said the simple “yes, sir,” that there must be expression in every movement of her lip. Observe, I was an invalid, full, at this very moment, of the selfishness of my own pains and aches which, though not of the heart,—and it would be difficult to convince a sick man that those of the body are not greater,— notwithstanding which my attention was at once arrested. “This is Mr. Trimble,” asked she, glancing at my crutches as if by those appendages she had heard me described. “That is my name,” I replied. “You have heard of Brown, who is now in—in jail, sir,” she continued. “Brown, the counterfeiter, who has been arrested for a theft,” I asked. “Yes, sir.” “I have repeatedly heard of him though I have never seen him.” “He told me to say, sir, wouldn't you go to the jail and see him about his case?” Brown's case, from what I had heard of it was a desperate one. Not knowing in what relation the poor girl might stand to him, I shrunk from saying so, though I feared it would be useless for me to appear for him, I therefore asked her, “Are you his sister?” “No, sir.” “His wife?” “No, sir, we are cousins like, and I live with his mother.” “Ay, is your name Brown?” “No, sir, my name is Mason—Sarah Mason.” “Where's Mrs. Brown, Miss Sarah?” I asked. “She is very sick, sir, I hurried away just as she got to sleep after morning—I have walked by here very often, and I thought, sir, you might have business out, and not be here to-day—do go and see him sir.” “Why, Sarah, to speak plainly to you, I am satisfied I can be of no service to him—he is a notorious character, and there have been so many outrageous offences lately committed, that if the case is a strong one, there will be little hope for the prisoner, and Brown's case, I understand, is very strong, I am told, that after they had caught him in the woods, as they were bringing him to the city, he confessed it,” “My, my, did he, sir,' exclaimed Sarah, starting from her seat and resuming it as quickly. “Yes, I think I overheard one of the constables say so. There are no grounds whatever in the case, for me to defend him upon. I can do nothing for him, and should get nothing for it if I did.” I said this without meaning any hint to Sarah, but she took it as such and replied: “I have some little money, sir—only a few dollars now,” and she turned herself aside so as with delicacy to take it from her bosom, but I shall have some more soon. I had some owing to me for some fancy work, but, when I went for it yesterday, to come and see you, they told me the store keeper had failed and I've lost it.” As she spoke, she held the money in her hand which she rested in her lap, in a manner that implied she wished to offer it to me, but feared the sum would be too small, and a blush—it was that of shame at her bitter poverty—reddened her forehead. I could not but be struck with her manner, and as I looked at her without speaking or attempting to take the money, she said, after a moment's pause: “It's all I have now, sir, but indeed, I shall have more soon.” “No, no, keep it, I do not want it,” said I, smiling. Instantly the thought seemed to occur to her that I would not accept the money from a doubt of its genuineness, as Brown might have given it to her and she said: “Indeed, sir, it is good money, Mr. Judah, who keeps the clothing store gave it to me last night—you may ask him, sir, if you don't believe it.” “Don't believe you! Surely I believe you—Brown must be a greater scoundrel than even the public take him for, if he could involve you in the consequences of his guilt.” “Sir, sir—indeed he never gave me any bad money to pass—I was accused of it, but indeed, I never passed a single cent that I thought was bad.” “Well, Sarah, keep the money—do not for your own sake on any consideration pass any bad money—go first and ask some one who knows whether any money you have is good and keep that.” “But sir, will you see him,” asked she imploringly. “Yes, I will, and because you wish it; I cannot go this morning, I shall be engaged. This afternoon I have some business at the court house, and I will, on leaving there step over to the jail.” “Please, sir, to tell him,” she said, hesitatingly, “that they won't let me come in to see him often. I was there yesterday but they wouldn't let me in—on Sunday, they said they would, not 'till Sunday—please, sir tell him that I will come then.” “I will, Sarah,” I replied; “and if you will be at the jail at two o'clock this afternoon, I will contrive to have you see Brown.” She thanked me, repeated the words “at two o'clock,” and again pressed the money on me, which I refused, when she withdrew closing the door noiselessly after her. She had not been gone more than half an hour, when a gentleman entered who was about purchasing some property, and who wished me, previously to his closing the bargain, to examine the title. He wanted it done immediately, and in compliance with his request I forthwith repaired to the recorder's office which stood beside the court house. I was then in the practic of the law in Cincinnati. My office was two doors from the corner of Main street, in Front, opposite the River, where I combined, the double duties of editor of a daily paper, and lawyer.— From my office to the court house, was as the common people say a “measured mile,” and nothing but the certainty of the immediate payment of my fee, in the then condition of my arms and health, versus pocket, (the pocket carried the day, and it is only in such cases that empty pockets succeed,) nothing but the consideration in the premises induced me to take up my crutches, and walk to the court house. After I had examined the title, I determined as it would save me a walk in the afternoon, to step over to the jail which was only a square or so off and see Brown. I did so, and at the gate of the jail found, seated on a stone by the way, side, Sarah Mason, who had instantly repaired thither from my office resolved to wait my coming, not knowing, as she told me, but what I might be there before two. I entered the jailor's room, in which he received constables, visitors, knaves previous to locking them up, lawyers, &amp;c., and handing a chair to Sarah, desired him to bring Brown out in the jail yard, that I might speak with him. While he was unlocking the greated door of the room in which Brown with many other crimnals was confined, several of them—who were also clients of mine, called me by name and made towards the door, with the wish each of speaking to me about his own case, perhaps for the fifteenth time. As soon as Brown heard my name he called out:— “Stop! it's to see me, Mr. Trimble has come—here Jaw-bone Dick, fix that bit of a blanket round them damned leg irons and let me shuffle out. Mr. Trimble came to see me”—controlled by his manner for he was a master spirit among them, as I afterwards learned, they shrunk back while Jaw-bone Dick, a huge negro, fixed the leg irons, and Brown came forth. He had a muscular iron form of fine proportions, though of short stature. His face was intellectual with a high but retreating forehead, and a quick bold eye.— His mouth was very large, displaying simply when he laughed his jaw teeth, but it was not ill shaped, and had the expression of great firmness when in repose, with that of archness and insinuation, generally when speaking. He gazed on me steadily for an instant after he had passed the threshold of the door into the passage, as if he would understand my character before he spoke. He then saluted me respectfully, and led the way into the back yard of the jail, which is surrounded by a large wall to prevent the escape of the prisoners who at stated periods are suffered to be out there for the sake of their health, and while their rooms are undergoing the operations of brooms and water.— Kicking as well as his fetters would allow him, a keg that stood by the outer door into the middle of the yard, Brown observed: “Squire, it will do you for a seat, for you and I don't like to talk too near to the wall—the proverb says that stone walls have ears, and those about us have heard so many rascally confessions from the knaves they have enclosed, that I don't like to entrust them—with even an innocent man's story—'twould be the first time they've heard such a one, and they'd misrepresent it into guilt.” The jailer laughed as he turned to leave us, and said: “Brown, you ought to have thought of that when the chaps nabbed you—for you told them the story, and they not only have ears but tongues.” “Damn them, they gave me liquor,” exclaimed Brown, as a fierce expression darkened his face. “I don't think a drunken man's confession should be taken, extorted or not.” As the jailer turned to lock up the yard with the remark to me, of “Squire, you can rap when you have got through”—I told him that it would save some trouble to him, if he would let the girl in his room who was a relation of Brown's see him now. After a slight hesitancy, he called her, observing, it was not exactly according to rule. “It's Sarah, I suppose,” said Brown, taking a station by my side with folded arms and giving a slight nod of recognition to the girl, as in obedience to the jailer's call she entered the yard—“You'd better stand there, Sarah,” he said to her, “'till Mr. Trimble gets through with me.” He then remarked in an under tone to me, It's no use for her to hear our talk—plague take all witnesses any how.” Eyeing me again with a searching expression, Brown, as if he had at last made his mind up to the matter, said, “I believe I'll tell you all, Squire—I did the thing.” “Yes, Brown, I knew you did,” I replied; “the misfortune is you told it to the officers.” “Yes—that's a fact. But maybe you can lead the witnesses on the wrong scent if you know just how things are—couldn't you?” I nodded, and he continued, “I boasted when they got me, considerable, but the fact is that I got the money—I was in the Exchange, on the landing, where I saw a countryman seated, who looked to me as if he had money—I contrived to get into conversation with him, and asked him to drink with me, he did so, and I plied him pretty strong. The liquor warmed him at last, and he asked me to drink with him, I consented, and when he came to pay his bill, he had no change, and had to dive into a cunning side pocket in the lining of his waistcoat, to get out a bill, though he turned his back round and was pretty cautious—I saw he had a good deal of money. I got him boozy, and when he left, I dogged him. He was in to market and had his wagon on the landing not far from the Exchange. He slept in it. He not only buttoned his vest tight up, but his overcoat tight over that, and laid down on the side where he hid away his rhino. Notwithstanding this,” continued Brown, and he laughed at the remembrance of his own ingenuity, “I contrived to make him turn over in his sleep, and cut clean out through overcoat and all, got his pocket with its contents—three hundred dollars. I had spent all my money at night with him. In the morning my nerves wanted bracing, and what must I do but spend some of his money for grog and breakfast. The countryman immediately went before a magistrate and described me as a person whom he suspected. The officers knew me from his description, and though I had left Cincinnati and got as far as Cleves, fifteen or eighteen miles, they followed so close on my track as to nab me that very day. I had been keeping up the steam pretty high along the road—they traced me in that way—and full of folly and the devil, for the sake of talking and keeping off the horrors, I made my braggs, and told all. I suppose my case is desperate.” I told him that I thought it was. “When I think of my old mother!” exclaimed he, passing his hand rapidly across his brow—he then beckoned Sarah to him, and I walked to the farther end of the yard so as not to be a listener. Their colloquy was interrupted by the jailer coming to the door. When I left him, Sarah followed me out, and after requesting me to call and see him again, she took a direction different from mine and I went to my office. The grand jury, of course, had no difficulty in finding a bill against Brown, and the day of his trial soon came. The countryman was the first witness on the stand. It was amusing if not edifying to observe the smirk of professional pride on the countenance of the prisoner, when the countryman recounted how he carefully buttoned up his coat over his money and went to sleep on that side, and awoke on that side—the right one—and found his pocket cut out with as much ingenuity as a tailor could have done it. I tried to exclude the evidence of Brown's confession from the jury on the ground that it was extorted from him, but that fact not appearing to the court they overruled my objection, and the facts of the case with many exaggerations were narrated to them by the officer who arrested the prisoner, as his free and voluntary confession. I had scarcely any grounds of defence at all. I tried to ridicule the idea of Brown's having made a confession; and presented the countryman in an attitude that made him the laughing stock of the jury and audience—but though it was evident to them that the countryman was a fool, it was not less apparent, I feared, that Brown was a knave. I had some idea of an alibi, but that would have been carrying matters too far. I, however, proved his good character by several witnesses. Alas, the prosecuting attorney showed that he was an old offender, who had been more than once a guest of the state's between the walls of the penitentiary. The prosecuting attorney, in fact, in his opening address to the court and jury, attacked Brown in the sternest language he could use. He represented him as the violator of every sound tie—and as hurrying his mother's grey hairs to the grave. At this last charge the prisoner winced—I saw the lightning of his ire against the prosecutor flash through the tears of guilt and contrition. When I arose to address the jury in reply, Brown called me to him and said: “Mr. Tremble, you know all about my case—you know I am guilty—but you must get me off, if you can, for my old mother's sake. Plead for me as if you were pleading for the Apostles—for the Saviour of mankind.” This was a strong expression to convey to me the idea that I must speak and act to the jury as if I held him in my own heart, guiltless—was it not? Poor Sarah, was a tearful witness of his trial. She was spared, however, being present when the verdict was rendered. The jury retired about dark; with the agreement between myself and the prosecutor that they might bring in a sealed verdict. I told Sarah for the sake of her feelings before the court adjourned, that they would not meet the next morning before ten o'clock. They met at nine, and before she got there, their verdict of guilty was recorded against the prisoner. As they were taking Brown to jail he asked me to step over and see him, saying that he had a fee for me. I had been unable to get from him more than a promise to pay before his trial. I, of course, gave that up as fruitless, and appeared for him on Sarah's account, not on his own, or with any hope of acquitting him. I therefore was surprised at his remark and followed him to the jail. He was placed in a cell by himself—the rule after conviction—and I went with him at his request and we were left alone. “Squire,” said he, with more emotion than I thought him capable of, “I don't care so much for myself—I could stand it, I am almost guilt-hardened—but when I think of my mother—oh! God—and Sarah, she has been as true to me as if I were an angel instead of a devil—but she wasn't in court to-day.” “No,” said I; “I told her that court would not sit until ten o'clock. I saw how deeply she was interested, and I saved her the shock of hearing your guilt pronounced in open court.” “Blast that prosecuting attorney,” exclaimed Brown, gnashing his teeth, “why need he go out of the case to abuse me about my mother, before Sarah—I'd like to catch him in the middle of the Ohio swimming some dark night—if he didn't go to the bottom and stay there it would be because I couldn't keep him down. But Squire, about that fee—you trusted me, and as you are the first lawyer that ever did, I'll show you that I am for once, worthy of confidence. Over the Licking liver, a quarter of a mile up on the Covington side— you know, Squire, the Licking is the river right opposite to Cincinnati, in Kentucky—Well, over that river, a quarter of a mile up, you will see, about fifteen feet from the bank, a large tree standing by itself, with a large hole on the east side of it. Run your hand up that hole, and you will take hold of a black bottle, corked tight—break it open. In it you will find fifteen hundred dollars—five hundred of it is counterfeit—the rest is good. Squire, it is your fee. Your character and countenance is good enough to pass the whole of it.” I bowed to the compliment which Brown paid my “character and countenance,” at the expense of my morals, and said, “you are not hoaxing me, I hope.” “I am not in that mood, Squire,” replied the convict, and asking me for my pencil, he drew on the wall a rough map of the locality of the river and tree, and repeated earnestly the assertion, that he himself in the hollow of the tree had hid the bottle. I left him rubbing the marks of his map from the wall, determined at the first opportunity to make a visit to the spot. The next day my professional duties called me on a visit to another prisoner in the jail, when Brown asked thro' the little loop hole of his door, if I had got that yet. “No, Brown,” I replied, “I have not had time to go there.” “Then, Squire,” he exclaimed, “you are in as bad a fix as I am, and the thing's out.” “How so,” I asked—I began to suspect that he thought I had been after the money, and that he was forming some excuse for my not finding what he knew was not there. “You see me, Squire, without a coat, my hat's gone too, Job Fowler, the scoundrel—he knows about that bottle—he was taken out of the jail yesterday to be tried just as they brought me in, I thought though my respectable clothes hadn't done me any good they might be of service to him, as his case wasn't strong and every little helps out in such cases, as they help the other way when the thing's dark, so I lent them to him. He was found not guilty, and he walked off, with my wardrobe, so the jury, damn them, aided and abetted him in committing a felony in the very act of acquitting him for one, and by this time he's got that money. Never mind, we shall be the state's guests together yet, in her palace at Columbus.” What Brown told me in regard to the bottle and Job Fowler, was indeed truth. Job was acquitted in Brown's clothes, and he walked off in them, and wended instantly to the tree beside the Licking, where he found the bottle, which he rifled of its contents without the trouble of uncorking it.— Mistaking the bad money for the good, he returned instantly to Cincinnati, and attempted to pass some of it. The man to whom he offered it happened to be in the court house, a spectator of his trial. His suspicions were aroused. He had Mr. Job arrested, and on him was found the fifteen hundred dollars. A thousand dollars of it were good, but I got none of it, for the 4 gentleman from whom Brown and Fowler together had stolen it was found. The very day that Brown was convicted, and Job acquitted in the former's clothes, he was arrested for passing counterfeit money. A bill was found against him that morning. He was tried that afternoon and convicted, and the day after he and Brown, handcuffed together, were conveyed to the penitentiary. PART SECOND. The interest which I took in Brown's mother and Sarah, induced me to visit them after he was sent to the penitentiary, to which he was sentenced for ten years. His afflicted mother, overcome by accumulated sorrow for his many crimes and their consequences, rapidly sank into the grave. I happened to call at her humble dwelling the night she died. Sarah supported her by her needle, and a hard task it was, for the doctor's bill and the little luxuries which her relative needed, more than consumed her hard earnings. The old woman called me to her bed-side, and together with Sarah, made me promise that if I saw her son again I would tell him that with her dying breath she prayed for him. The promise was made, and while she was in the act of praying her voice grew inaudible, and uttering with her last feeble breath an ejaculation for mercy, not for herself, but for her outcast child, her spirit passed to the judgment seat; and if memory and affection hold sway in the disembodied soul, doubtless she will be a suppliant there for him, as she was here. After the death of the old woman, I saw Sarah once or twice, and then suddenly lost all trace of her. More than a year had now elapsed since Brown's conviction, and in increasing ill health and the presence of other scenes and circumstances as touching as those of the mother and the cousin, I had forgotten them. I was advised by my physician to forsake all business, obtain a vehicle and by easy stages, traveling whither Fancy led, try to resuscitate my system. In fulfilment of this advice, I was proceeding on my way to Columbus, Ohio, with the double purpose of improving my health, and by making acquaintances in the State where I had settled, facilitate and increase my practice, should I ever be permitted to resume my profession. The sun was just setting in a summer's evening, as, within a half a mile of Columbus, I passed a finely formed female on the road, who was stopping along with a bundle on her arm. There was something of interest in the appearance of the girl which caused me to look back at her after I had passed. Instantly I drew up my horse. It was Sarah Mason. Her meeting with me seemed to give her great pleasure. I asked her if she would not ride, and thanking me, she entered my vehicle and took a seat by my side. She had been very anxious to obtain a pardon for Brown before his mother's death. I had told her it would be fruitless unless she could get the jury who condemned him, together with the judges, to sign the recommendation to the governor, and I did not beheve they would do it. I, however, at her earnest solicitation, drew up the petition, and when I last asked her about her success, which was, in fact, the last time I saw her, she told me she had not got one of the jury to sign it, but that several had told her that they would do so, if she would obtain, previously, the signature of the presiding judge. By the law of Ohio, a judgeship is not held for life, but for a term of years. The term of office of the presiding judge on Brown's trial had expired, and a new party prevailing in the legislature from that which had appointed him, he had failed to obtain the re-appointment. He had removed to St. Louis for the purpose of practising law there, and thither Sarah had repaired with her unsigned petition. After repeated solicitations and prayerful entreaties, she at last prevailed on the ex-judge to sign it. She then returned to Cincinnati, and after considerable trouble succeeded in finding ten of the jury, some of whom followed the judge's example. The rest refused, stating what was too true, that the ease with which criminals obtained pardon from gubernatorial clemency in this country, was one of the great causes of the frequency of crime, for it removed the certainty of punishment which should ever follow conviction, and which has more effect upon the mind than severity itself, when there is a hope of escaping it. A new governor, in the rapid mutations of official life in the United States had become dispenser of the pardoning power shortly after Brown's conviction, and it was his ear that Sarah personally sought, armed with the recommendation. He was a good, easy man, where party influence was not brought to bear adversely on him, and after he had read the petition, Sarah's entreaty soon prevailed, and Brown was pardoned. The very day he was pardoned he called on me at Russell's hotel with his cousin, and after they had mutually returned me their thanks for the interest which I took in their behalf, he promised me, voluntarily, to pay me a fee with the first earnings he got, which he said solemnly should be from the fruits of honest industry. He took my address and departed. I thought no more of it, till, one day, most opportunely, I received, thro' the post-office, a two hundred dollar bill of the United States Bank, with a well-written letter from him, stating that he had reformed his course of life, and that it was through the influence of his cousin, whom he had married, that he had done so. He said that he had assumed another name in the place where he then dwelt, which he would have no objection to communicate to myself, but as it was of no consequence to me, and might be to him, should my letter fall into the hands of another person, he had withheld it, together with the name of the place where himself and wife were located. The letter had been dropped in the Cincinnati post-office, and there was no clue whereby I could have traced him had I entertained such a wish, which I did not. Some time after this I was a sojourner in the south, spell-bound by the fascinations of a lady with whom I became acquainted the previous summer in Philadelphia, where she was spending the sultry season. She lived with her parents on a plantation near a certain city of the Mississippi, which, for peculiar reasons, I may not name. Her brother was practising law there, and he and I became close cronies. Frequently I rode to the city with him, and on one occasion we were both surprised, as we entered it, by an unusual commotion among the inhabitants, who were concentrating in crowds to a spot, collected by some strange and boisterous attraction. My friend rode into the melee, and presently returned to my side, with the crowd about him, from whom he was, evidently, protecting a man, who walked with his hand on the neck of my friend's horse. The man walked as if he felt that he was protected, but would die game if he were attacked. “Sheriff,” called out my friend to a tall person who was expostulating with the crowd, “it is your duty to protect Bassford; he has lived here with us some time— has a wife and family, a good name, and he must and shall have a fair trial.” “Colonel Camerons' empty pocket-book was found near Bassford's house,” exclaimed one of the crowd, “and Bassford's dagger by the dead body.” “And Bassford and the colonel were overheard quarrelling a few hours before he was killed,” shouted another. “Let Bassford answer then according to law,” said my friend. “I will kill the first man who lays violent hands on him.” “And I will justify and assist you,” said the sheriff. Mr. Leo, Mr. Gale and you, sir,” continued the officer, turning to me, “I summon you to assist me in lodging this man safely in jail, there to abide the laws of his country.” Awed by the resolution which the sheriff and his posse exhibited, the crowd slunk back, but with deep mutterings of wrath, while we gathered round Bassford, and hastened with him to the jail, which was not far off, in which we soon safely lodged him. It occurred to me when I first looked on Bassford, that I had seen him before, but I could not tell where. A minuter scrutiny, as I stood by his side in the jail, satisfied me that he was no other than my old client, Brown. Feeling that my recognition of him would not advance his interests if I should be questioned about him, I maintained silence, and stood by, a spectator.— Brown stated to the sheriff that he wished my friend, whom I will call De Berry, to be his counsel, and requested that he might be placed alone with him, where he might have some private conversation with him. The sheriff said “certainly,” and we all retired, De Berry asking me to wait for him without. I did so, and in a few minutes he came to me, and said that the prisoner wished to see me. “I presume, sheriff, you will have no objection.” “Not the least,” replied the sheriff. “Take Mr. Trimble in with you.” I accordingly entered, and the moment the door was closed Brown asked me “if I remembered him.” “Perfectly,” I replied. “Mr. Trimble,” he continued, “I saw you with Mr. De Berry, and knew that you recognized me. I supposed that you might tell him what you knew of me to my prejudice. Here I have maintained a good character, and I therefore resolved to see you with him, and tell you the circumstances. I am as guiltless now as I was guilty then. Mr. De Berry says that the court, upon application, will admit you, if it is necessary, to defend me with him, and I wish you would do it. Let me tell this affair. I know it looks black against me, but hear me first. After my cousin obtained my pardon in Ohio, I married her, swore an oath to lead a better life, and before God have done so. Sarah was and is every thing to me. Not for the wealth of worlds would I involve myself in guilt which might fall upon her and her children. Knowing, Mr. Trimble, that in Ohio I could not obtain employment or reinstate myself in character, I came here with a changed name and nature, to commence, as it were, the world again. Since I have been here my character, as Mr. De Berry will tell you, has been without reproach. But old associations and companions dog us, though we fly from them. I have been located here on a little farm belonging to Mr. De Berry, which, with the aid of two negroes hired from him, I cultivate, raising vegetables and such things for the market. I had hoped the past was with the past, but last week there came along one of my old associates, who urged me to join with him and others in a certain depredation. I told him of my altered life, and positively refused. He insisted and taunted me with hypocrisy and so forth, 'till he nearly stung me to madness. I bore it all, until, on my telling him that my wife had reformed me, and that, on her account, I meant to be honest, he threw slurs on her of the blackest die. I could bear it no longer, but leaped upon him and would have slain him, had not some of his companions came up and rescued him. It was on the banks of the river in a lonely spot that we met, and their coming up might have been accident or not. He vowed vengeance against me and mine, and left. Colonel Cameron, as you know, Mr. De Berry, bore the character of an overbearing and tyrannical man. We had some dealings together. He was in my debt, and wished to pay me in flour. I told him politely it was the money which I wanted.— He swore that I should not have money or flour either. He raised his whip to strike me. I flew into a passion, dared him to lay the weight of his finger on me, and abused him as a man in a passion and injured would do under the circumstances—perhaps I threatened him—I do not know exactly what I said in my anger. This was yesterday afternoon. It seems that the Colonel went to Mr. Pottea's afterwards—returned after night— was waylaid and killed. How his pocket book came by my house I know not. As for the dagger I had such a one, When I changed my name I thought to make every thing about me seem natural with it, that I would have Bassford engraved on it. I lost it some months ago, and have not seen it since 'till to-day. Such, gentlemen, is the truth, but great God, what is to become of myself and family with such testimony against me. Two or three men in the crowd called out that they knew me before—that I had been in the Ohio penitentiary—that my name was Brown, and here is my quarrel with the colonel, his murder on the heels of it—my dagger by his dead body, and his empty pocket-book by my house. Notwithstanding all this, gentlemen, I am innocent. Do you think, if I had murdered him that I would not have hid my dagger—and would I have rifled his pocket-book and pitched it away by my own door-sill, where anybody might find it? No, my enemy must have contrived this to ruin me.” At this instant the door was opened by the sheriff, and Brown's wife admitted—she threw herself into his arms, exclaiming:—“He is innocent, I know he is innocent!” while Brown, utterly overcome by his emotions, pressed her to his heart and wept bitterly. I whispered to De Berry that we had better leave them, and accordingly withdrew. That afternoon, Mrs. Brown called to see me. She asked me if I would aid her husband; and I promised that I would. She looked neat and tidy, said she had two children, and I saw that she was soon again to be a mother. She told me the same story that Brown had told me, and I could not but express the deepest regret for his and her situation. The name of Brown's former accomplice, with whom he had quarrelled, was Burnham. He was a desperate character, perfectly unfeeling and unprincipled, and possessed of great energy of spirit and frame. It is surprising that Brown should have overcome him. Brown's mastery originated, doubtless, in the fury of his insulted feelings. De Berry became very much interested in Brown's case. The morning of his interference in his behalf, Brown had been taken upon the charge of murdering Colonel Cameron. While the Sheriff, who was well disposed towards him, was proceeding with him to the magistrate's, the crowd had gathered round them so thickly as to interrupt their progress, and Brown had been separated from the officer. The crowd, among whose leaders was Burnham, had made furious demonstration against the prisoner; but his resolute manner had prevented their laying hands on him, when De Berry and myself rode up, and the Sheriff, as we have related, took his charge to jail, to prevent an outrage, until the excitement had somewhat subsided. The next morning, De Berry insisted upon having a hearing before the magistrate, asserting that he meant to offer bail for Brown. As we proceeded to the magistrate's, we stopped at Brown's humble dwelling, and took his wife and children with us. The tidiness of his afflicted wife and children, and the evident order of his household and garden, made a most favorable impression upon us. As we approached the magistrate's, we wondered that we saw nobody about the door of his office, but we learned, on arriving, that the officer of the law had determined to have the hearing in the court-house, in consequence of the anticipation of a great crowd, who would be anxious to hear. To the court we repaired. There was an immense concourse about the door, though the Sheriff had not yet appeared with his charge. De Berry sent the wife and children to the jail, that they might come with him to the court-house, and by their presence and the sympathy that they would excite, prevent any outbreak from the mob. We took our station on the court-house steps, where, elevated above the crowd, we could observe their demeanor as the Sheriff and Brown advanced. By our side stood a tall gaunt Kentuckian, clad in a hunting-shirt, and leaning on his rifle. He seemed to be an anxious observer of myself and friend. He soon gathered from our conversation the position in which we stood towards Brown, and remarked to us: “Strangers, I suppose you are lawyers for Bassford; I am glad he has help, I fear he'll need it, but he once done me a service, and I want to see right 'twixt man and man.” Before De Berry could reply, we were attracted by a stir among the crowd, and not far off, in the direction of the jail, we saw the sheriff advancing with the prisoner, who was accompanied by his wife and children. Approaching close behind them, were several horsemen, among whom we could not fail to observe Burnham, from the eagerness with which he pressed forward. With not so much as the ordinary bustle and confusion incident upon such occasions; in fact, with less suppressed emotion, the crowd gathered into the court-house, the Squire occupying the seat of the Judge and the prisoner a chair within the bar, by the side of De Berry and myself, with his anxious wife to his right. The prosecuting attorney, who was a warm friend of the deceased Colonel, seated himself opposite to us. Burnham pressed through the crowd within the bar, and stationed himself near the prosecutor, to whom I overheard him say: “There are folks here who can prove that his real name is not Bassford but Brown, and that he was pardoned out of the Ohio penitentiary; that man by his lawyer can prove it, so can I, but you had better call him, he knows—” “Let me pass, let me pass!” exclaimed a female at this moment, pressing through the crowd with stern energy; “I'll tell the truth—Bassford is innocent!” “She's crazy!” exclaimed Burnham, looking around with alarm, and making a threatening gesture, as if privately, to her to hush, forgetting that the eyes of all were upon him. “Crazy!” retorted the woman, who was of slender person and fine features, though they were distorted by excess and passion, and who seemed to be possessed by some furious purpose as if by a fiend. “They shall judge if I am crazy. Prove it, and then you may prove that Bassford is guilty. Gentlemen, John Burnham there, murdered Colonel Cameron! There is the money that Burnham took from the dead body!—there are letters—here is his watch. Bassford's dagger he got in a quarrel with him; he murdered the Colonel with it, and left it by the dead body, and the pocket-book by Bassford's house to throw the guilt on him!” “How can you prove this, good woman?” inquired the magistrate, while the crowd, in breathless eagerness, were as hushed as death. “Prove it!—by myself, by these letters, by that watch, by that dagger—by everything, by what I am, by what I was. The time has been when I was as innocent as I am now vicious—as spotless as I am now abandoned; but for that man, that time were now! Hear me for a moment; the truth that is in me shall strike your hearts with justice and with terror, shall acquit the innocent and appal the guilty. In better days I knew both these men; Bassford I loved—he loved me. My education had been good; that was all my parents left me, with a good name. He was thoughtless and wild then, but not criminal; he fell in with this man Burnham, whom he brought to my father's house and made his confidant. Burnham professed a partiality for me, which I rejected with scorn. He led Bassford into error, into crime. He coiled himself into his confidence, and made him believe that I had abandoned myself to him, at the same time he was torturing me with inventions of Bassford's faithlessness towards me. Each of us, Bassford and myself, grew reserved towards the other, without asking or making any explanation. Oh! the curse of this pride—this pride! Burnham widened the breach. He drove me nearly mad with jealousy, and Bassford with distrust. Bassford and I parted in anger. Burnham all the while pressed his passion on me. Bassford left that part of the country, Hagerstown, Maryland. I promised to marry Burnham; in a spell of sickness, which was brought on me by the absence of Bassford, he drugged me with opium made me what I am, and abandoned me to my fate. After many wretched years of ignominy and shame, I fell in at Louisville, three weeks since, with Burnham; I came here with him. He saw Bassford—tried to draw him into his guilty plots—they quarrelled; and he—he never, never told me aught until he had done the deed—he murdered Colonel Cameron to ruin Bassford; and there, I repeat it,” pointing to the watch, the money, and the letters of the deceased, “there are the evidences of his guilt!” “Sheriff,” said the magistrate, “take Burnham into your custody.” “Kill him!” cried out an hundred voices from the crowd, while several attempted to seize him. Uttering a yell like a wild Indian at bay, Burnham eluded the grasp, and drawing, at the same instant, a bowieknife from his breast, he darted forward and plunged it into the heart of the woman. The crowd shrunk back in terror, as the death cry of the victim broke upon the ear, while the murderer, brandished the bloody knife over his head, and before any one could arrest him, he sprung out of one of the windows of the court-room. It was a leap which none chose to follow, and all rushed instantaneously to the door Before the crowd got out, Burnham had mounted his horse and made for the woods. Several of the horsemen who had come in the line, mounted and darted after, as if to take him. “They want to save him,” exclaimed several who were also mounting other horses that stood by. “Clear the road!” shouted the Kentuckian, who, rifle in hand, had sprung upon a mound within a few feet of the court-house. The horsemen looked fearfully back, as if instinctively they understood the purpose of the hunter, and spurred their horses from the track of the flying man. The Kentuckian raised his rifle to his shoulder—instantly its sharp report was heard. All eyes were turned to the murderer, who was urging his steed to the utmost. He started, as if in renewed energy, then reeled to and fro like a drunken man, then fell upon the neck of his horse, at the mane of which he seemed to grasp blindly; in a moment more he tumbled to the earth like a dead weight. He was dragged, with his foot in the stirrup, nearly a mile, before his horse was overtaken and stopped. The bullet of the sure-sighted Kentuckian had lodged in the murderer's brain. He had fallen dead from his saddle, and was so disfigured as scarcely to be recognized. The body was consigned to a prayerless, hurried, and undistinguished grave by the road side. Brown is still alive where I left him, an entirely reformed and honest man. A stone slab, with some rude attempts at sculpture on it, at the foot of Brown's garden, designate the mortal resting-place of the woman, who, though fallen and degraded, was true to her first affection, and braved death to save him. His children, with holy gratitude, have kept the weeds from growing there, and ever, in their play, become silent when they approach it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WILLIAM WIRT. Perhaps there was no individual in our country more highly endowed with intellectual gifts than the late William Wirt, the greatest public blunder of whose whole career was that late in life, and at the eleventh political hour he suffered himself to be announced as a candidate for the Presidency, by a party with whom he had not before acted. But be this as it may, all must admit, who knew him, that whatever Mr. Wirt did he did conscientiously. We all know and feel that “to err is human,” and we have yet to learn that error is a proof of selfishness. The Roman Cato when he found that “This world was made for Cæsar,” field to suicide. He might have shunned the deed, and outlived Cæsar, as Mr. Wirt did the excitement which made him a Presidential candidate, and still like him have served his country. “The post of honor is a private station” oftener than politicians are aware of, but still without guile they have often quit it to return to it without reproach. Until this event, Mr. Wirt pursued the even tenor of his profession through a long life, dignifying it with the official statesmanship of Attorney General of the United States, and not as a mere lawyer, who like a drudge-horse can only go in the gears of a particular vehicle, but adorning and illustrating it with literature and science. His knowledge of history, and of the ancient and modern classics was as profound as his legal acquirements, while his political information and sagacity kept pace with his other improvements. His genius was of the first order, and he improved it with the most sedulous care. He exerted his mind at times as an author, then as an orator, and daily as a lawyer, while his efforts in each department improved his general powers, and gave him that variety of information and knowledge, which, when combined with genius, makes what Mr. Wirt really was, a truly great man Not great only in politics, literature or law, but great in each and all, like Lord Brougham. Many of his countrymen were his superiors in some departments of learning, as they may be said to be his superiors in some natural endowments, but for universality and variety of talent perhaps he was not surpassed. Mr. Wirt had none of the adventitious aids of high birth, fortune and connexions, to assist him up the steep of Fame. He was compelled to force his own way, unaided and unfriended; and like many other great men of our country, he taught school for a maintenance while he studied law. It was during that time, while he was a student, or immediately after he was admitted to the practice, that he wrote the letters of the “British Spy.” The description of the novi homines, the new men, which he so eloquently gives in one of those letters applied aptly to himself. The eloquence with which he describes the elevated purposes of oratory, exhibited his own devotion to the art, while it showed his capability of excelling in it. It may be said to be almost the peculiar privilege of an American to win his own way by the gifts which natude has given him, with the certainty that success will wait on merit. Wealth and family influence, it is true, have great weight in the start of a young man; but in the long run, superior talents will gain the prize, no 5 matter what may have been the early disadvantages of their possessor, provided the resolution to be true to himself comes not too late. The history of almost every departed, as well as of almost every living worthy of our country, proves this remark, and it is right that it should be so. Perhaps this, more than any other feature in a Republic, tends to its durability, while it renders it glorious. The great mass of the people are seldom wrong in their judgments, and therefore it is that with them talents meet with a just appreciation whenever they become known, at least talents for oratory. Mr. Wirt had all the qualifications for obtaining the popular good will. He possessed a fine person, remarkable amenity of manners, colloquial qualities of the first order, wit at will, and he abounded in anecdotes, which he related with remarkable pleasantness and tact. A stranger, on entering an assemblage where Mr. Wirt was, would immediately on perceiving him, have supposed him a superior man. His person was above the middle height, with an inclination to corpulency, his countenance was “sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;” his mouth was finely formed, and a physiognomist would have noted that the compression of his lips denoted firmness, and his smile good humored irony. He had a Roman nose, an eye of cerulean blue, with a remarkably arch expression when he was animated, and of calm thoughtfulness when his features were in repose. His forehead was not high, but it was broad with the phrenological developments strongly marked, particularly the poetic and perceptive faculties. His hair was sandy, and his head bald on the top, which, with a Byronian anxiety, he tried to hide by combing the hair over the baldness—and it was much his custom, when engaged in an oratorical display, to preserve its adjustment by passing his hands over it. He was much more careful in this regard than is the eloquent and chivalric Preston, who, though he wears a wig, seems not only indifferent as to who knows it, but of the wig itself; for in the sturdy breeze which blew over the Canton course, at the Baltimore convention, it nearly left him—he the while apparently unconscious as he fulminated to the vast and wrapt multitude. Well! the Carolinian may not love the laurel as Cæsar did, because it hid his baldness; but he deserved to have it voted to him long ago for his eloquence. General Harrison used to tell—peace to his ashes, and a nation's living gratitude to his name and fame— as he gladdened the hearth at the Bend with stories of the past and present, how he remembered to have seen Patrick Henry, in the heat of his glorious declamation, twist the back of his wig until it covered his brow, and any one who has heard the Senator from Carolina, would say that the resemblance between himself and his illustrious relative, extended from great things to small ones. At the first glance at Mr. Wirt's countenance when he was not engaged in conversation or business, the observer would have been struck with the true dignity of the man, whose mind seemed to hold all its energies in perfect control. His self-possession was perfect. When he rose to address the court or jury, there was no hurry, no agitation about him, as we perceive in many men. On the contrary, he stood collected, while his enunciation was deliberate and slow. He stated his proposition with great simplicity; in fact it was generally a self-evident one, the applicability of which to the case, if it were intricate and doubtful, the hearer might in vain endeavor to trace; but when he heard the orator to the conclusion, he would wonder that he had fancied any uncertainty about it. For Mr. Wirt would lead him on by the gentlest gradations until he was convinced. It may be mentioned, too, that Mr. Wirt, like Mr. Clay, was a great taker of snuff, and he handled his box with a grace which would have rivalled even that of the Senator from Kentucky. Lord Chatham, it was said, made his crutch a weapon of oratory: “You talk of conquering America, sir,” said he, “I might as well attempt to drive them before me with this crutch.” And so Mr. Wirt made, and Mr. Clay makes, his snuff-box an oratorical weapon. Mr. Wirt's language was, at times, almost oriental—his figures being of the boldest, and his diction correspondent. His speeches in Burr's trial show this, though latterly he chastened somewhat his diction and his thoughts. He sustained himself well in the highest flight of eloquence, his hearers having no fear that he would fall from his eminence, like him in the fable, with the waxen wings. On the contrary, the hearer felt confident of his intellectual strength, and yielded his whole feelings to him without that drawback we experience in listening to some of the ablest speakers, who often have a glaring imperfection, which is continually destroying their eloquence. Mr. Wirt studied oratory with Ciceronian care, and in the recklessness with which he let fly the arrows of his wit, he much resembled the Roman. The power of ridiculing his adversary was Mr. Wirt's forte. The appropriate manner in which he applied an anecdote was admirable. After he had demonstrated the absurdity of his opponent's arguments, with a clearness that the most critical logician would have admired; after he had illustrated his position with all the lights of law, that law whose seat Hooker said, “is the bosom of God, and whose voice is the harmony of the world” (and when Mr. Wirt had a strong case he explored every field of literature and science, bringing their joint sanction to his purposes;) after he had called up the truths of philosophy, the experience of history, and the beauties of poetry, all coming like spirits thronging to his call; after he had expatiated upon the cause with such reflections as you would suppose Barrow or Tillotson to have used when speaking of the “oppressor's wrong;” after he had done all this, Mr. Wirt would, if the opposite party deserved the infliction, pour forth upon him a lava-like ridicule, which flamed while it burned, and which was at once terrible and beautiful—terrible from its severity and truth, and beautiful from the chaste language in which it was conveyed. Mr. Wirt always struck me as being very much like the late Prime Minister of England, Canning, in his mind. Canning wanted, and Wirt, in a degree, the power of calling up and controlling the stronger and deeper passions of our nature. He had not that withering scorn which Brougham possesses so strongly, nor could he rise above the tempest of popular commotion, as he tells us Patrick Henry could, and soar with “supreme dominion.” He wanted deep passion. Comparing him with the leading orators of our country, it would be said that Clay far surpassed him in the power of controlling a miscellaneous assemblage, when the public mind was deeply agitated; that Pinckney on a question of feudal lore, Webster in profundity and on constitutional law, and that Preston, in the glow of vehement declamation, would have had the advantage over him; but before an auditory who loved to mingle wit with argument and elegance with strength, who would make truth more beautiful by the adornments of poetry, and poetry useful as the handmaid of truth, adding to all those exterior graces which make oratory so captivating—before such an auditory, it may be said, without great hesitation, that Mr. Wirt would have surpassed either of them in general effect. Mr. Wirt's gestures, too, that of which the Grecian thought so much, were in keeping with his other excellencies. The fault was that they were studied—and yet the art with which he concealed his art was consummate. It was only by the closest observation that it could be detected. For a long time, Mr. Wirt's chief opponent at the Baltimore bar, was Mr. Taney, the present Chief Justice of the United States. Mr. Taney removed to Baltimore, from Frederick, on the death of Pinckney, and there Mr. Wirt and himself were the great forensic rivals. No two men of the same profession could be more different in their intellectual gifts than were these gentlemen. They were as unlike in these regards as they were in their personal appearance. Mr. Taney was then slim to feebleness, (he looks now improved in health,) he stooped, and his voice was weak, and such was the precarious condition of his health, that he had to station himself immediately before and near the jury to make himself heard by them. Mr. Wirt always placed himself on the side of the trial table, opposite the jury, in oratorical position. Mr. Taney's manner of speaking was slow and firm—never using the least rhetorical ornament, but pressing into the heart of the case, with powerful arguments, like a great leader, with unbroken phalanx, into the heart of a besieged city. His style was plain, unadorned, and so forcible and direct, that it might be called palpable. With his snuff-box—for the Chief Justice then, too, used snuff—compressed in his closed hands, he reasoned for hours without the least attempt at wit or eloquence. And yet, at times, he was truly eloquent from his deep, yet subdued, earnestness. In a question of bail in the case of a youth who had shot at his teacher, I remember, though then a youthful student, that a crowded auditory were suffused in tears. It was the fervor of his own feelings, speaking right out, that made him eloquent. He did not appear to know that he was eloquent himself. It was an inspiration that came to him, if it came at all, unbidden—and which would no more answer to his call than Glendowers' “Spirits from the vasty deep.” One of the most interesting cases ever witnessed at the Baltimore bar, was a trial in a Mandamus case, in which the right of a church was contested. Mr. Duncan had been established in the ministry in Baltimore by a number of Scotch Presbyterians, in an obscure edifice. His talents drew such a congregation that it soon became necessary to build a larger one. It was done; and, in the progress of events, the pastor preached a more liberal doctrine than he had at first inculcated. His early supporters remained, not only unchanged in their faith, but they resolved to have it preached to them by one with whom they could entirely agree upon religious matters. The majority of the congregation agreed with Mr. Duncan. A deep schism arose in the divided flock which could not be healed, and which was eventually, by a writ of mandamus, carried before a legal tribunal. Mr. Taney was counsel for the old school side, and Mr. Wirt for the defendants. The court room, during the trial, was crowded with the beauty and fashion of the monumental city. It was such a display of eloquence, and a full appreciation of it, as is seldom witnessed. Mr. Wirt was always happy in making a quotation, and in concluding this cause he made one of his happiest. After alluding to the old school members, who, it has been said, were Scotchmen, and after dwelling upon the tragedy of Macbeth, the scenes of which are laid in Scotland, he described their preacher as being in the condition of Macbeth's guest, and said, after a stern rebuke upon them, that though they should succeed in their cause, which he felt confident they would not, that they would feel like the guilty thane. “This Duncan Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been So clear in his great office, that his virtues Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against The deep damnation of his taking off.” This quotation was made with such oratorical effect. that there was a deep silence when Mr. Wirt took his seat, which was succeeded by repeated outbreaks of applause. Mr. Wirt gained the case. As an author Mr. Wirt's merits are very high. His “British Spy” contains sketches of some of our first men, drawn with a graphic power which makes us regret that he did not oftener direct his fine mind to the delineation of character. He was eminently calculated for a biographer. His high tone of moral feeling would have prevented him from becoming the apologist of vice, no matter how high were its endowments; while his great admiration of virtue and talent, would have made him the enthusiastic eulogist of those qualifications which render biography so attractive and so useful. The great fault of his life of Patrick Henry is exaggeration. His mind became heated and inflated as he contemplated the excellencies of Henry as an orator and a man, and he over-colored that which, told with more simplicity, would have been more striking. The effects of Henry's eloquence being so wonderful in themselves, narrated in a plainer way, would have more forcibly struck the mind. What they borrowed from the poetry of the biographer, seems “Like gliding refined gold, painting the lilly, Or throwing a perfume on the violet.” Mr. Wirt's Old Bachelor is deserving a high commendation. It is written in numbers, after the manner of the Spectator, Guardian, and Adventurer, and has much of the eloquence of style which has contributed so largely to the popularity of those celebrated works. It treats of various subjects; oratory, poetry, morality, &amp;c., and abounds in reflections happily suited to the condition of young men who are entering the learned professions. It is not sparse of wit, while it shows the author's familiar acquaintance with the old worthies of English literature, those who drank of the “well of English undefiled.” It should not be neglected to be said of Mr. Wirt that he was one of those who, in early life, from the pressure of an unfriended condition upon a mind of excessive sensitiveness, fell, for a while, into reckless despondency, alternated by wayward fits of intellectual energy, which had an unfortunate influence upon his habits. Such has been the situation of men like him, who had the “fatal gift,” without any other gift—no friendly hand— no cheering voice. Alas, the records of genius for wretchedness is surpassed only by the records of the lunatic asylum. In fact, its history often illustrates and deepens the saddest story on the maniac's wall. But, to the glory of Mr. Wirt, it is known that his energies prevailed—that friends came—that religious hope, which had formerly visited him, like the fitful wanderings of a perturbed spirit, at last made her home by his hearth, where a beautiful and gifted family grew up around him, until, full of honors and of years, and the faith that is beyond them, he was gathered to his fathers. When contemplating the moral and intellectual character of Mr. Wirt, it has been regretted that he did not turn away from the thorny paths of the law, and devote the whole force of his mind to general literature; but how could he, with the poor rewards of literature, support those nearest and dearest to him? Yet, had circumstances allowed him to have done so, he would have been one of the first literary men of our country. I have frequently heard Mr. Wirt when opposed to some of our most eminent men, and this slight sketch is drawn from opinions then entertained and expressed. I presented, while he lived, the tribute of my admiration, not to the politician, not to the candidate for the Presidency, but to the author of the “British Spy,” “The Old Bachelor,” “The Life of Henry,” a great lawyer and acute statesman, a consummate advocate, and last, though not least, an honest man; and now, that he is dead, I would fain garner testimonials to his memory worthy of him—but the will must be taken for the deed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A VISIT TO SIMON KENTON, The Last of the Pioneers. “An active hermit, even in age, the child Of Nature, or the Man of Ross, run wild.” —Byron. Falling, the other day, accidentally, upon Byron's beautiful lines in Don Juan, on— “General Boone, Backwoodsman of Kentucky,” I thought, as I dwelt upon their freshness—fresh as the forests and the character which is his theme—of a visit which I paid some years ago to Boone's cotemporary and similar, Simon Kenton, who died shortly afterwards— and I determined to fill out a slight sketch then made of him. One bright morning in October, I think, '34, after a hearty breakfast on venison, with the becoming appliances of cranberry jelly, and all the etceteras of a luxurious meal, such as you often get in the western country, and which our kind hostess of West Liberty, Ohio, had, according to the promises of the previous evening, prepared for us by day-dawn, my friend and myself started from that village on our way to Bellefontaine, resolved to call and pay our respects—the respects of strangers and travelers—to Simon Kenton, who, we were informed, dwelt some thirty miles from our whereabouts. It was a glorious Indian summer morning. The day had just broke as we started, and the thick haze, which characterizes this season of the year, enveloped the whole landscape, but without concealing, made it just indistinct enough for the imagination to group and marshal hill, prairie, tree and stream, in a manner agreeable to our feelings. The haze rested on the face of Nature like a veil over a sleeping beauty, disclosing enough of her features to charm, without dazzling us with the flash of her eye, which makes us shrink while we admire. A vast prairie extended on our right, through which loitered a lazy stream, as if it lingered, loth to leave the fertile soil which embosomed it. A silvery mist hung over it, making it appear like a great lake. Here and there arising from the immense body of the prairie, were what are called islands—that is, great clumps of trees, covering, sometimes, many acres, appearing just like so many islands in an outstretched ocean. Onee I observed was peculiarly striking: it was a natural mound arising out of the prairie, and was covered with a dense wood, while around it the plain extended far and wide, and was as level as a floor. As the day dawned the scene became more and more enchanting. The sun blazed up through the forest trees that skirted the prairie like a beacon fire. Those of the trees which were earliest touched by the frost, and had lost their foliage, seemed like so many warriors stretching forth their arms in mortal combat; while the fallen ones, which lay in their huge length upon the ground, might easily be fancied so many brave ones who were realizing the poet's description of a contrast: “Few shall part, where many meet.” Then my fancy caught another impression; I thought, as I looked upon the tranquil scene—the wide prairie— the sheep browzing on it—the gentle stream—the mist curling up—the towering trees—the distant hills—the blue smoke ascending here and there from a rustic dwelling—all looking tranquillity—I thought that Peace had lit her altar, and all Nature was worshipping the Being whose blessings were upon all. The rich tint of those trees which still retained their foliage, added to the beauty and oneness of the scene; and, in gilding the picture, harmonized with it. On our left, a hill ascended abruptly up, covered with tall trees, which, in some places, were remarkably clear of underwood, and in others, choked up with it. The undergrowth, from its great luxuriance, where it did appear, seemed emulous of the height of its neighbors. At the foot of the hill, and winding around it, lay our road; sometimes it would ascend the hill's side to the very summit, and then abruptly descend to the very foot. This gave us a full view of the surrounding scenery. It was beautiful. To me, like that of another world, coming, as I did, from the contagious breath of the city, where disease and death were spread, wide as the atmosphere, for I had just left Cincinnati, where the cholera was raging. The bustle of business—the hum of men—the discordant noises—the dusty streets—the sameness and dingy red of the houses—the smoky and impure atmosphere—the frequent hearse—the hurrying physician—the many in black, were all remembered in contrast with this bright scene of Nature. I caught myself almost unconsciously repeating the lines of the poet: “Oh, how canst thou renounce the boundless store Of charms, which Nature to her votary yields! The warbling woodland, the resounding shore, The pomp of groves, the garniture of fields; All that the genial ray of morning gilds, And all that echoes to the song of even; All that the mountain's sheltering bosom shields, And all the dread magnificence of Heaven; Oh, how canst thou renounce, and hope to be forgiven?” I felt at once why I had been an invalid. I had been breathing an air pregnant with all sorts of sickness; was it any wonder I was sick? I had swollowed a whole drug shop—for what purpose? To be drugged to death? Every thing in this world takes the hue of our feelings. A few weeks previously I had been to a wedding in Lebanon, where I had enjoyed myself gloriously. We kept it up till “'tween the late and early,” and all went off appropriately— “As merry as a marriage bell.” The next morning I breakfasted with the bewitching bride and her generous lover, and then away from the bridal scene in a hazy rain, over horrible roads, tossed about in a trundle-bed of a carry-all, with no companion but my crutch, and a whole host of bachelor reflections. The scene was sad every where. I passed an old rooster by the road side. He stood alone, dripping wet, with not a single hen near him—chick nor child— like a grand Turk who had been upset in an aquatic excursion, and has quarrelled with his whole seraglio. A dog skulked by me, with his tail between his legs, looking, for all the world, as if he had been sheep-killing. How desolate the girdled trees looked! As the winds whistled through their leafless branches, they seemed the very emblems of aspiring manhood, deprived of all his honors when he thought them greenest; yet still standing with the world's blight upon him. The road wound about, as if it had business all through the woods; and the long miry places, which were covered with rails, to prevent one from disappearing altogether! what jolting! what bouncing! zigzag—this way, that way, every way. Why, Sancho Panza, when tossed in the blanket, enjoyed pefect luxury in the comparison. And when, at last, I did get upon a piece of road that was straight, it appeared a long vista leading to utter desolation. The turbid streams were but emblems of the lowering sky. They looked frowning on each other, like foe on foe, while the autumn leaves fell thick around me, like summer hopes. To-day is different—all is bright. To-morrow may be cloudy—and thus wags the world. There is no nobler theme for the novelist and the poet, than the stirring incidents of the first settlement of our country. The muse of Scott has made his country appear the appropriate place for romantic legend, and traditionary feud, but it only wants his genius, to make our country more than the rival of his, in that respect. The field here is as abundant, and almost untrodden. However, I am not one of those who believe that legends of the olden time are the best themes for the novelist. If he would describe truly the manners, virtues and vices round him, as they are, he would win more applause than in the description of other scenes; because all would feel the truth of the portraiture. Scott failed in describing modern manners in Saint RomansWell. Why? Because his affections and feelings were with the past; and those ballads and romances in which his boyhood delighted, exercised over his imagination a controlling power, and when he came to give them a “local habitation and a name,” that controlling power was manifest. But who of Scott's readers has not regretted that he did not give us more of the men and manners of the day? If he had thought as much of them as of baronial and other periods—and having studied, he had attempted to paint them when his mind was in its vigor, he would have succeeded as well as in Ivanhoe, Rob Roy, or the Crusaders. Fielding could only describe the manners around him, because he had only thought of them. Scott's imagination had a feudal bias, and consequently he painted that period best when, as he describes it— “They laid down to rest, With the corselet laced— Pillowed on buckler cold and hard: They carved at the meal With gloves of steel, And drank the red wine through the helmet barr'd.” How delightful if Scott had given us some of the scenes which he witnessed among the different circles with whom he mingled. In such scenes he studied human nature, it is true, but he applied his knowledge in describing how men acted in other circumstances than those in which he saw them act, for he well knew that the truthful portraiture finds sympathy in every breast. He learned the whole history of the human heart, and then gave us volumes of the olden time, because there his imagination feasted. He should, sometimes, have shown us ourselves as we are. It seems to me that not only in our early history is there a wide field for the novelist, but that in our own times there is both a wider and a better. What a great variety of characters in our country! Men from all climes, of all opinions, parties, sects. The German, Frenchman, Englishman, Russian, the Backwoodsman, the Yankee, and the Southerner, are each and all often found in the bar room of a country tavern. To one who likes to observe character, what enjoyment! Why, as Fallstaff would say, “it is a play extempore.” And then to quit a scene like this, pass a few miles from one of these towns, and be right into the wilderness: for it seems a wilderness to look round on the deep woods, and the wild prairie, and see no marks of civilization but the road on which you travel. How the mind expands! You look up, and fancy some far off cloud, the Great Spirit looking down on His primeval world, in all the freshness and beauty of its first years. The imagination glows, the feelings freshen, the affections become intense. Rapidly, then, the scenes of our boyhood rush upon us, our early manhood, our hopes, our fears, the lady of our love, the objects of our ambition. We see some brilliant bird that we have started from its perch, dart off in the blue ether, and thus before us seems the world, all our own. And then we enter the town, and behold the vast variety of human beings among whom and with whom we have to struggle. Here, too, we often find women lovliest and most fascinating—a flower in the wilderness, and beautiful both in bud and in bloom. And here are generous and free spirits, who wear no disguise about them, whose feelings spring up like the eagle from its eyrie, in natural fearlessness. The change is enjoyment: one fits us for the other. In solitude, we think over, examine, and analyze what we see in the world; and in the world, the reflections and resolutions of solitude strike us like a parental admonition. That simplicity which Cooper has described so well in the character of Leatherstocking, seems to have been the characteristic of the early pioneers. It has been my good luck to meet with several of them. One, who is now a country squire, and of course, far advanced in years, with whom I became acquainted in the interior of Ohio, frequently in conversation with me, dwelt upon the peculiarities of the pioneers, lamenting with simplicity, energy, and natural eloquence, which told that he was one of them, the “falling off,” as he called it of the present times. “Why,” said he to me, “if you will believe me, there is not half the confidence between man and man that there used to be, when I was in the wilderness here, and used to travel to the different stations. It 6 was a long tramp, I tell you—but you might rely on the man that went with you, to life and to death just as you would on your rifle—and then you rested upon your rifle—and looked upon the beauties of the wilderness— and the wilderness is beautiful to them that like it—and felt that you were a man. Why, I could do everything for myself in those days—I needed no help no how—I tell you I have a snug farm, and may be, some things that you call comforts; but I shall never be as happy as I was when here in the wilderness with my dog and rifle, and nothing else. No, I shall never be as happy again, and that's a fact. Mr. —, our preacher, preaches a good sermon, bating a spice of Calvinism, that I, somehow, can't relish or believe natural, but he can't make me feel like I used to—I mean with such reliance on Providence—as I did when I roused up in the morning, and looked out on the beauties of nature, just as God made them. You find fault with these roads —and I know the traveling's bad—I thought so myself as I came to town—and yet I used to travel through the wilderness when there was no road or town. I sometimes felt tired, it is true, but it was not the weariness I feel now—no, no! I never shall be so happy as I was in the wilderness, and that's a fact.” I believe I have repeated the very words as they fell from the lips of the fine old man. I was much amused with his opinion of novels. “Why, I am told,” he said, “that a man will write two big books—and not a word of truth in 'em from beginning to end. Now ain't that abominable! To tell a lie, any how is a great shame; but to write, and then to print it, is what I never thought of. How can you tell it from truth, if he's an ingenious man! It looks just like truth when 'tis printed. It destroys all confidence in books. Judge Jones tells me that there was a man called Scott, who has written whole shelves of 'em—what do you call 'em? novels? He tells me that he was a pretty good sort of a man, too, with a good deal of the briar about him. I read one of them books once, that I liked, I suppose, from the name; they called it the `Pioneers;' that's the reason I read it. I think there must be some mistake; you may depend upon it, that man, Leatherstocking never could have known so much about the wilderness, and the ways of the Ingins, without being in it, and among 'em.” What a fine compliment to the powers of Cooper.— The scenery was striking and as we passed along, our conversation turned, of course, upon it, and from that, to the dark forms that once flitted through it—and to those who had first struggled with the red man for its possession; and how naturally to him whom we were going to visit, who had been among the first and most fearless of the Pioneers, and who was then lingering the last of them. Simon Kenton's life had been a very eventful one— perhaps the most so of all the Pioneers. Boone has been more spoken of, and written about; but in all probability, the reason is, because he was the oldest man, and had been, then, sometime dead. Kenton was a Virginian by birth, and, I believe, entirely uneducated. At a very early age, he quarreled with a rival in a love affair, and after an unsuccessful conflict with him, Kenton challenged him to another, and was getting the worst of it, in a rough and tumble fight, and being undermost, subject to the full rage of his antagonist, he was much injured; when it occurred to him that if he could twist his rival's hair, which was very long, in a bush near by, he could punish him at his leisure. Crawling to the point under the stunning blows of his antagonist, Kenton, with desperate energy, seized him by the hair, and succeeded in entangling it in the bush as he desired. He then pummelled him with such right good will, that he thought he had killed him.— Kenton, fearing the consequences, instantly absconded, and changed his name from Simon Butler, which was his real name, to Simon Kenton. He pushed for the West. There he joined in several excursions against the savages, and was several times near being taken by them. He acted as a spy between the Indians and the colonies, in the war occasioned by the murder of Logan's family. After many adventures and hardships, he was taken by the Indians, in purloining some of their horses, which, in retaliation, he had led away in a night foray into one of their villages. He was treated with great cruelty: he ran the gauntlet thirteen times, and was finally saved from torture, by the interference of Girty, a renegade white man, who had joined the Indians, and was their leader in many of their attacks on the whites. Kenton and Girty had been friends, and pledged themselves so to continue, whatever changes might overtake them, before Girty apostatized. He, with all his savageness and treachery, was true to Kenton. This is but the caption of a chapter in Kenton's life. After journeying for some time through thick woods, in which there was innumerable grey and black squirrels, we arrived at an angle of a worm fence, and turned off into a swampy road, towards a log house, in which, we are told, the old Pioneer lived. The house was comfortable and large, for one of the kind. On stopping, a son-in-law of the old worthy met us at the bars, and, though he knew us not, with the hospitality of the country, he insisted upon putting up our horses, which kindness we were compelled to decline, as we could not tarry long. As we advanced towards the house, I observed every thing about it wore the air of frugal comfort. We ascended two or three steps, and entered the room, in which was a matron, who, we learned, was the wife of the Pioneer, and seated by the fire, the old worthy himself. He rose as we entered. Advancing towards him, I said, “Mr. Kenton, we are strangers, who have read often of you and your adventures, and being in your neighborhood, we have taken the liberty to call and see you, as we were anxious to know one of the first and the last Pioneers.” The old Pioneer was touched and gratified by the remark, and while shaking hands with us, he said: “Take seats, take seats, I am right glad to see you.” We sat down and immediately entered into conversation with him. He conversed in a desultory manner, and often had to make an effort to recollect himself, but when he did his memory seemed to call up the events alluded to, and when asked anything, “well I'll tell you,” he would say, and after a pause, he narrated it. I have stood in the presence of men who had won laurels by field and flood, in the senate, at the bar, and in the pulpit, but my sensations were merely those of curiosity— a wish to know the impressions which the individual made upon himself, corresponded with the accounts given of him by others—if his countenance told his passions; and if the capabilites which he possessed could be read in him. This wish to observe prevents all other sensations and makes one a curious but cold observer. But far different were my feelings as I looked upon the bent but manly form of the old Pioneer, and observed his frank and fine features. Here, thought I, is a man, who, if human character was dissected with a correct eye, would be found to be braver than many a one who has won the world's eulogy as a soldier. Who cannot be brave with all the “Pride, pomp, and circumstance, of glorious war” about him! With the neighing steed, the martial trump, the unfurled banner, the great army! In such a scene, the leader of so many legions finds, in the very excitement, bravery. The meanest soldier, catches the contagious spark, and cowards fight with emulation. But think of a man alone in the wide, wild wilderness— whom a love of adventure has taken there, surrounded by wild beasts and savage foes, hundreds of miles from human aid—yet he sleeps calmly at night, and in the morning, rises to pierce farther into the wilderness— nearer to those savage foes, and into the very den of those wild beasts. How calm must have been his courage! How enduring his spirit of endurance! In the deep solitude, hushed, and holy as the Sabbath day of the world, he stands with a self-reliance that nothing can shake; and he feels in the balmy air—in the blue heavens—in the great trees—in the tiny flower—in the woods, and in the waterfalls—in the bud, and in the beast—in everything and in all things, companionship. George Washington would have made such a Pioneer. Kenton's form, even under the weight of seventy years, was striking, and must have been a model of manly strength and agility. His eye was blue, mild, and yet penetrating in its glance. The forehead projected very much at the eyebrows, (which were well defined,) and then it receded, and was not very high, nor very broad—his hair had been a light brown; it was then nearly all grey—the nose straight and well shaped, his mouth, before he lost his teeth, must have been expressive and handsome. I observed that he had one tooth left, which, taking into consideration his character, and manner of conversation, was continually reminding one of Leatherstocking. The whole face was remarkably expressive not of turbulance or excitement, but rather of veneration and self-possession. Simplicity, frankness, honesty, and a strict regard to truth, appeared the prominent traits of his character. In giving an answer to a question which my friend asked him, I was particularly struck with his truthfulness and simplicity. The question was, whether the account of his life in “Sketches of Western Adventure,” was true or not? “Well, I'll tell you,” he said, “not true: the book says, that when Blackfish, the Indian warrior, asked me, after they had taken me prisoner, if Colonel Boone sent me to steal the horses, that I said no, Sir; (here he looked indignant, and rose from his chair;) I tell you I never said Sir to an Ingin in my life; I scarcely ever say it to a white man.” Mrs. Kenton, who was engaged in some domestic occupation at the table, turned round, and remarked:— “When we were last in Kentucky, some one gave me the book to read, and when I came to that part, he would not let me read any more.” “And I tell you,” interrupted Kenton, “I never was tied to a stake in my life, to be burned; they had me painted black when I saw Girty, but not tied to a stake.” I mention this not at all to disparage the book, but to show Kenton's character—for though personally unacquainted with the author, I have a high respect for his talents; besides Mr. M'Clung does not give the account of Kenton's adventures as narrated to himself, by him, but as abridged from a MS. account, given by the venerable Pioneer himself, and now in the possession of Mr. John D. Taylor, of Kentucky. Kenton stated that he had narrated his adventures to a young lawyer, (whose name I forget,) and that all in the book was true. In answer to a question about Girty, he observed: “He was good to me: when he came up to me, when the Ingins had painted me black, I knew him at first. He asked me a good many questions, but I thought it best not to be too forard, and I held back from telling him my name; but when I did tell him, oh! he was mighty glad to see me. He flung his arms round me, and cried like a child. I never did see one man so glad to see another yet. He made a speech to the Ingins—he could speak the Ingin tongue, and knew how to speak—and told them if they meant to do him a favor, they must do it now, and save my life. Girty, afterwards, when we were at (I think he said) Detroit together, cried to me like a child, often, and told me he was sorry of the part he took against the whites—that he was too hasty. Yes, I tell you, Girty was good to me.” I remarked, It's a wonder he was good to you.” “No,” he replied quickly, but solemnly, “it's no wonder. When we see our fellow creatures every day, we don't care for them; but it is different when you meet a man all alone in the woods—the wild lonely woods. I tell you, stranger, Girty and I met, lonely men, on the banks of the Ohio, and where Cincinnati now stands, and we pledged ourselves, one to the other, hand in hand, for life and death, when there was nobody in the wilderness but God and us,”—his very language, and a sublime expression I thought it. He spoke kindly of the celebrated Logan, the Indian chief, and said he was a fine looking man, with a good countenance, and that Logan spoke English as well as himself. Speaking of the Indians, he said: “Though they did abuse me mightily, I must say that they are as 'cute as other people—with many great warriors among them—they are as keen marksmen as the whites, but they do not take as good care of their rifles. Finding one's way through the woods, is all habit. Indians talk much less than the whites, when they travel, but that is because they have less to think about.” He spoke of Boone, and said that he had been with him a great deal. He described him as a Quaker-looking man, with great honesty and singleness of purpose, but very keen. We were struck with his acuteness and delicacy of feeling. He was going to show us his hand, which had been maimed by the Indians; he half drew off his mitten, and then pulled it on again. “No,” said he, “it hurts my feelings.” My friend observed that it was mentioned in the different accounts of him, that when himself and his companions arrived at the Ohio, with the horses of the Indians, they might have escaped if they had followed his advice. “Understand, understand,” said he, “I do not mean to blame them. The horses would not, somehow, enter the river. I knew the Indians were behind us, and told them so. They would not leave the horses; I could not leave them, so the Indians came yelling down the hills, and took us.” I observed to him that I wondered, after his escape from the Indians, that he did not return to Virginia, and run no more risks in being taken by them. “Ah!” said he, “I was a changed man; they abused me mightily. I determined, after that, never to miss a chance”—(meaning at the life of an Indian.) He was very anxious that Clarke's life should be written—General George Rogers Clarke—who, he said, had done more to save Kentucky from the Indians than any other man. He told us that a gentleman from Urbanna, Ohio, had been with him two or three days, and that he had told him a good deal about himself; “but,” said he, “I am mighty anxious to tell what I know about Clarke. You may depend he was a brave man, and did much.” He then told us that not five miles from the place where we were, he had been a captive among the Indians, painted black, with his hands pinned behind him, his body lacerated with the severest treatment; the bone of his arm broken, and projecting through the flesh, and his head shockingly bruised. I observed to him that he must have been a very strong and active man, to have endured so many hardships, and made so many escapes. “Yes,” said he, “I believe I might say I was once an active man, but,” continued he, taking my crutch in his hand, as I sat beside him, and holding it, together with his staff—I could trace the association of his ideas— “I am an old man.” I observed from his manner that he wished to ask me about my crutch, but that he felt a delicacy in doing so. I explained it to him, after observing the fashion of it for some time—for I had a fashion of my own in my crutches—he looked earnestly at me, and said, with emotion, showing me his own staff— “You see I have to use one, too; you are young and I am old; but I tell you we all must come to it at last.” Many, in their courtesy, have tried to reconcile me to my crutch, but no one ever did it with so bland a spirit as this blunt backwoodsman, who “never said sir to an Indian in his life, and scarcely ever to a white man.” True politeness is from the heart, and from the abundance of the heart it speaketh—the rest is but imitation, and at best, the automation fashioned to act like a man. We rose twice to leave; ere we did so the old worthy pressed us so warmly “not to go yet.” At last, after a hearty shake of the hand with him, we departed on our way to Bellefontaine. We were scarcely on the road, before the rain descended fast upon us, but we went on, transacted our business, and returned to West Liberty to spend the night, unmindful of the heavy storm that poured down upon us in our open buggy, but full of the old pioneer, and the reflections which our visit had called up. We looked around, and did not wonder that the Indians fought hard for the soil, so fruitful with all the resources and luxuries of savage life, redolent with so many associations for them—all their own—theirs for centuries—their prairies, their hunting grounds—the places where their wigwams stood, where their council fires were lit, where rested the bones of their fathers, where their religious rites were performed. How often had they hailed the “bright eye of the universe!” as we hailed him that morning, almost with a Persian's worship, and on that very spot, in a few hours, we beheld him sinking in his canopy of clouds. And thus they sink, and the shadows of their evening grow darker and darker, and they shall know no morrow.— Happy for those who now possess their lands, if they cherish, and if their posterity cherish, the homely virtues, the simple honesty and love of freedom of the early Pioneers—of him with whom we shook hands that morning on the brink of the grave. If they do, then indeed may their broad banner, with its stars and stripes trebled, he planted on the far shores of the Pacific, the emblem of a free united people.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MARY M'INTYRE HAS ARRIVED. On my way to St. Louis, safe and sound, I arrived at Louisville, on the steamer Madison, now years agone. The falls of the Ohio, at Louisville, were so low, that the Captain resolved to go round by the canal, which was cut to obviate the necessity of unloading vessels to lighten them, so as to permit their passage over the falls. At ten o'clock, A. M., we reached Louisville, and the Captain told me, upon enquiry, as I wished to pay my respects to a friend or two of that hospitable city, that the boat would not leave until one o'clock, as he had to take on board a number of Scotch immigrants with their baggage, who had been brought thus far from Pittsburgh on a boat that was returning. I therefore had ample time to make a morning call or two in passing, a pleasure of which I generally avail myself on our Western waters, whenever the boat on which I happen to be a wayfarer stops, where I have acquaintances. I resolved to pay my respects to “Amelia,” the sweetest poetess of our land, in whose society I spent a most agreeable hour, which I would willingly have prolonged, but the admonition, that the boat started at one o'clock, rose to my memory. I therefore repaired to the wharf half an hour before one, determined to be in time. Lo! as I approached the wharf, I beheld the Madison lumbering along in the canal, stopping every moment as if to take breath, being in fact retarded by some obstacle or other, which she could not surmount without the aid of poles, and ropes, and a fresh start. My only remedy was to ride round to Lockport, where the canal terminates by passing into the river, and wait an indefinite period for the arrival of the steamer, or get on board a row boat and have myself transported after her in the canal, and thus reach her, which I was assured could be affected in half an hour at farthest. I accordingly fee'd two youths who were padling about in a boat, to convey me to the Madison. I was soon seated astern and they pulled away for the steamer. We soon entered the canal, but owing to the waves the steamer threw in her confined track, and her lumbering movements from side to side, it was with difficulty and delay that we approached her. The Scotch immigrants were what are called on the Western waters, deck passengers; of that class almost all of whom are poor, but often very respectable, who in the packet ships in crossing the Atlantic, take a steerage passage. Among the immigrants on the Madison were many females, among whom there were some young and beautiful ones. As I ripped out a strong Western oath. (I am ashamed to write it, for I have not pronounced one for a long time,) at the Captain for breaking his word with me and leaving before the hour, one of these Scotch lasses said to me imploringly, for our boat had gotten immediately under the stern of the steamer, where she stood, “Oh! sir, please don't swear so.” Struck with the tone and beauty of the Scotch maiden, my impulse of anger changed to one of admiration, and I instantly said to her— “Well, I won't again—and you must be like Sterne's angel when my uncle Toby swore; you must drop a tear upon the word in the high archives and blot it out forever.” As I said this I stretched out my hand to reach the railing of the steamer, but failed, as our boat gave a lurch at the moment. Again I made the effort, and would have failed again had not the pretty Scotch girl leaned over the vessel's side and given me her hand. Thus assisted, in a moment more I was on the steamer's deck beside my fair assistant. I thanked her with all the grace I could master, which she received with a blush and said: “But you forget, sir, that my uncle Toby's oath was to save life.” “But it was unavailing,” I replied, “yet your fair hand stretched out to me may have saved mine, therefore, as I live and may err, “Nymph, in thy orisons, Be all my sins remembered.” “Poor Ophelia, ejaculated the Scotch girl sadly, “she went crazy for love.” “Ah,” thought I, “here is intelligence as well as beauty, taking a steerage passage, and not the first time, for with poverty they have been companions before, and love, too, I suspect, is no stranger in this party.” Impressed with these reflections, I entered into conversation with my new-made acquaintance and soon discovered that she was remarkably intelligent, as well as beautiful. It seemed to me that fair hair was never braided on a fairer brow. Her neck and shoulders were exquisitely turned, and added to the charm of features, which were decidedly patrician. There was a naivete in her manner, too, that had caught its tone from a position, I thought, evidently above her present one. She had also nothing of the Scotch in her accent, which was broad enough on the lips of her companions. Though she was apparently poor, there was not only great neatness in her humble toilette, but a style that was above the “clay biggin.” Several little trinkets upon her person—a ring, breast-pin, and particularly a massive gold cross, attached to a handsome chain—attracted my attention, especially the latter, and indicated, not only from their value, but the manner in which they were worn, her superiority to her companions, as well as the fact to my mind, that she was a Roman Catholic. Her companions were rigid Presbyterians, I soon learned, and my fair assistant into the boat and reprover did not attend, I observed, when an old Scotchman, in the afternoon, read the Bible to the group of immigrants gathered about him, but withdrew to the side of the boat and looked over pensively into the water. She interested me much. Being myself, at that time, the wearer of a large pair of whiskers and an imperial to match, my humble traveling companions were rather shy of me, but soon observing that my fellow passengers above stairs knew me well, and that I was not unpopular among them, the Scotch folk grew rapidly familiar and frank with me. I learned from a solemn and remarkably pious old Presbyterian, the history of the beautiful Scotch girl, whose name was Mary M'Intyre. He sighed heavily when he told it. Her father was an humble farmer of the better sort, and lived in Ayrshire. An old Roman Catholic nobleman who dwelt in Edinburgh, had a daughter, who, on a visit, which she made to Ayrshire, became acquainted with Mary, and treated her as an humble friend. When the young lady returned to Edinburgh she took Mary with her, who was affianced to a young miller in the neighborhood, named McClung. In fulfilment of an old Scotch custom, which Burns and his Highland Mary practiced, they at parting broke a piece of silver over a running brook, and on a Bible plighted their everlasting faith unto each other. In the progress of events, Mary, to the horror of her lover's faith, became a Roman Catholic. Her lover wrote her what she thought a harsh and uncalled-for letter on the subject. Her maiden pride, as well as her religious prejudices, were aroused, and she returned him his letter without a word of comment. Both were stung to the quick; the lover, though he went to Edinburgh, left for the United States, without calling to see her, and wandered away up the Missouri river. Mary grew thin and absent-minded, and exhibited all the symptoms of a maiden sick for love. Three years passed, Mary's friend had died, and she had returned to her father's, the while wasting away, when lo! a package came from the far Western wilds from Mary's lover. He implored her to forgive him for his conduct to her, in the humblest terms, and in the strongest he expressed the endurance of his passionate love, and he stated that he had thought of nothing else but Mary since he had left Scotland; that knowing every Sunday that she was worshiping in the Catholic church, he went to one himself, that he might worship with her, and that he had become a Catholic, and sent her the antique cross she wore in testimony of his love and of his faith. He furthermore told Mary that he was doing well in the New World, that if she said so he would go for her, but that it would ruin his business, (he was a true Scotchman) and he concluded by begging Mary to come to him. These immigrants were on the point of leaving Scotland, many of them were Mary's especial friends, and she determined to embark with them. How I felt interested in that Scotch girl! In proud saloons since in gay and wild Washington, I have many a time and oft felt all the impulses of my fitful and wayward nature aroused and concentrated to please some dark-eyed one from the sunny South, or some fair descendant of the Puritans, or may be some dame of high degree from over the waters, cynosures of fashion in the Capitol, but remember I not woman yet, who more struck my fancy than this bonnie lassie from the land of Burns. She could tell me so many things traditional in Ayrshire about Burns and his birthplace, and then she admired him so much, and could sing his songs so well. We had a long passage, and as she kept herself aloof from the other passengers, I was all day and half the night by her side. She half made me a Catholic. I have since with uncertain steps and some short comings, been trying to fix my conduct where my firm faith and hope and heart are fixed, in the humble ways of Methodism; and I know that Mary will think none the less of me when she sees this avowal, but then I was careless of everything but the enjoyment of the hour that was passing over me. It was just this time of the year, (May,) and the beautiful Ohio never was more beautiful. How many simple and frank questions she asked me, and as she did not know that I knew her secret, I could so plainly trace in all her thoughts the image of her lover the controling one, as the bright moon above us was the 7 controling light. Several times, when she knew not that I observed her, I witnessed her devotions, and I thought, as I saw her clasp the crucifix, her lover's gift and pray, that some earthly adoration mingled with her heavenly vows. One day as we sat chatting together with more than usual unreservedness, I observed: “Well, you will soon marry some rich American. “No,” she instantly replied, “I prefer a poor Scotchman.” I must have felt a pang of jealousy of her lover at the time, for I remarked: “Mary, you have asked me what I thought was the difference between a Scotch woman and an American; I will tell you: an American would make her lover come to her; a Scotch woman, as you know, would come to her lover.” Her brow and bosom crimsoned in an instant, and rising from my side, she looked at me and said: “Sir, you have no right so to wound a lonely woman's heart,” and bursting into tears, she walked away from me. Whatever may have been my misunderstandings with men, and they have been few, I certainly never had then had one with a woman, and my uncourteous and uncalled for remark stung my own pride as a gentleman, as much as I had wounded Mary's womanly nature. I instantly followed her, and used every effort to reconcile her, but without effect; she walked away from me with a haughty inclination of the head, and entered her humble apartment. I learned that one of her chief objections to her voyage, was this coming to her lover instead of with him. Her refined education had taught her this refinement of woman delicacy. I could not forgive myself for the wound I had inflicted on Mary's feelings, and I soon began to feel that I should not forgive her, for not forgiving me. At last we approached a point not far below St. Louis, near by Jefferson barracks, where the Scotch immigrants were to debark, and they were all bustle and preparation. I sat smoking a segar on the guards and watching them. Mary, in the certainty of meeting her lover, was with a natural anxiety practising all the arts of the toilette to make her scanty wardrobe do its best. I could see her arranging her hair and shawl, and consulting one of the Scotch girls as to their adjustment, whose opinions, but for her own anxiety, she would have disregarded. Doubtless, she often thought, years may have changed me much, and he—how he will be disappointed! She may have fancied that her very education, which gave her a different air and manner from what she had when he wooed her, might make an unfavorable impression upon him. I never in my life thought I could easier read a woman's feelings. At last we reached the point of the Pilgrims rest, and the boat rounded to, but, when they landed, Mary's lover was not there! She seemed stupified; and the others were so busied with themselves and their own concerns, that they thought not of Mary or her lover. She took a seat on her trunk on the shore amidst the baggage, which the immigrants were getting off, and looked the very picture of despair; as with her hands clasped in her lap, she gazed now here now there, as if she thought that from some point or other he must come, but he came not. My provocation at Mary for her unforgiveness was gone. I arose from the guards of the boat, threw my segar overboard, and went ashore. I had often been at this point on pleasure excursions from St. Louis, and I saw several persons that I knew. I went up to a young Frenchman, whose employment was carting wood to St. Louis, and after a profusion of compliments between us, for he was an old acquaintance, I asked him if he knew a Scotchman named McClung, a miller in the neighborhood? “Well monsieur—ah well.” “How far from here does he live” I asked. “Ah—about—two mile.” I will give you a five dollar gold piece if you will mount a fleet horse and go to him and tell him that the Scotch immigrants have arrived”—and I showed the glittering coin. “Instanter, Monsieur,” he replied, with a dancing eye. “Stop,” I exclaimed, and taking one of my cards from my pocket, I wrote on it with pen and ink which he got for me from the boat, the simple words, “Mary M'Intyre has arrived.” I saw my Frenchman in a few minutes more at the top of his speed, on a Canadian pony, dashing like mad through the woods. As I walked towards the boat, I met Mary's eye, but she instantly averted it as if she thought I was taking pleasure in her grief at her not finding on the spot, to welcome her, the lover she had “come to.” What strange creatures we are. I felt a proud thrill through my heart. No, my bonnie lassie, thought I, I'll have a braver revenge upon you than that —you shall forgive me. Time flew on—the baggage was all landed; we were preparing to depart, when some one exclaimed; “Look yonder! there's some chaps coming to the boat, or else they're racing it, for they've got all steam on.” We looked, and sure enough two horsemen were bounding towards us, as if with such intent, and one was my Frenchman, so I supposed, the other was McClung; and I soon knew it, for I could see his Miller's clothes. The whole boat was excitement, and the Captain ordered delay for a moment, till they should arrive, not knowing what their eager haste meant. I understood it: McClung was thinking of his Mary M'Intyre and the Frenchman of his five dollar gold piece. “They come on bravely,” was the cry. “Yes, and the Miller is ahead,” exclaimed another. I was glad to see LOVE ahead of AVERICE, but I suspect it was owing more to the steeds than their riders. I looked at Mary. At the cry “the Miller is ahead,” she had risen from her listless posture, and was gazing intently at the horsemen. In a moment, the Miller's horse was bounding home without his rider, for he had not thought to fasten him as he threw himself from his back. He rushed towards Mary, and in a instant they were in each other's arms. Such a wild embrace of joy I never witnessed. I thought their kindred hearts, like the “kindred drops” of the poet, would literally mingle into one. “Ah, Mon dieu,” exclaimed the Frenchman from the shore, for the Captain had ordered our departure, mad at the delay, and we had left. “Ah, mon dieu,” my five dollar, dat gold piece—I am a cheat!” I stuck it in an apple, and threw it on the shore, and had the satisfaction of seeing the Frenchman bound towards it like the Miller toward Mary, and grasp it too; and I laughed heartily at the manner—so eager, and yet so gentle, holding it between his compressed legs in which he made the luscious pippin disgorge its golden treasure. The last thing which attracted my attention on the shore, was the Frenchman, who stood beside Mary, and the Miller, with one hand restoring the gold piece to its lustre by rubbing it on his pantaloons; and in the other holding the pippin, from which he was taking large contributions, while he gesticulated with that member when not applied to his mouth, towards the steamer, evidently trying to do a good many things at once, and among the rest to explain who sent him on his errand. Ah, though I, I have had my revenge. Years after this, I was again in St. Louis, in a very sickly summer. Partaking, may'be, too freely of its hospitalities—for I never saw a more hospitable people than those of St. Louis; and not being used to the climate, I was seized with a bilious fever—in fact it was yellow fever. I was in a boarding house, and in a very confined room, and the physician said if I could not be taken to the country, I would die. I became unconcious. I awoke one morning at last, with a dreamy impression of existence, but I had not the slightest conception of my location. I discovered that I was in the country, and as, in the progress of days, returning life grew keener, I found myself in a pleasant chamber, and a lady attending to me. She would not let me talk at first, but I at last learned that I had been there a week delirious; and further, from a black servant, that her mistress had, without taking off her clothes, watched on me all that time. I was about questioning the black girl further, when from a moment's absence, her mistress returned; and after remarking how much better I was, asked if I did not know her? I looked at the beautiful lady before me,—for she was indeed beautiful—tho' she looked wan, from her attendance upon me I supposed, and replied: “Indeed, my dear Madam, I do not know you, though I shall never forget you.” She stepped to the mantle-piece, and took from it a small richly gilt frame, which looked as if it contained a miniature, and showing it to me, I beheld within it my card given to the Frenchman: “Mary M'Intyre has arrived,” Mr. McClung had greatly prospered in the world, and Mrs. McClung was what she would have been, in fact, in any situation—a Lady in the Land, and now an acknowledged and received Lady. She seldom visited St. Louis, and when she did she stopped at the house where I was so ill, and hearing my name mentioned, and learning who I was, she had me conveyed to her house in her own carriage, supporting my unconscious head all the way herself. Lucky for me was this last arrival. I may speak again of this Scotch lassie, for we have met in other scenes, where beaming the “bright, particular star,” fashion, and rank, and intellect did her homage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE. “Great wits to madness nearly are allied.” I remember some years since to have seen John Randolph in Baltimore. I had freqently read and heard descriptions of him, and one day, as I was standing in Market, now Baltimore street, I remarked a tall, thin, unique-looking being hurrying towards me with a quick impatient step, evidently much annoyed by a crowd of boys who were following close at his heels, not in the obstreperous mirth with which they would have followed a crazy or a drunken man, or an organ grinder and his monkey, but in the silent curious wonder with which they would have haunted a Chinese bedecked in full costume. I instantly knew the individual to be Randolph from the descriptions. I therefore advanced towards him, that I might make a full observation of his person without violating the rules of courtesy in stopping to gaze at him. As he approached, he occasionally turned towards the boys with an angry glance, but without saying any thing, and then hurried on as if to outstrip them, but it would not do. They followed close behind the orator, each one observing him so intently that he said nothing to his companions. Just before I met him he stopped a Mr. C—, a cashier of one of the banks, said to be as odd a fish as John himself. I loitered into a store close by, and, unnoticed, remarked the Roanoke orator for a considerable time, and really he was the strangest looking being I ever beheld. His long thin legs, about as thick as a strong walking cane, and of much such a shape, were encased in a pair of tight small clothes, so tight that they seemed part and parcel of the limbs of the wearer. Handsome white stockings were fastened with great tidiness at the knees by a small gold buckle, and over them, coming about half way up the calf, were a pair of what, I believe, are called hose, coarse, and country knit. He wore shoes. They were old-fashioned, and fastened also with buckles—huge ones. He trod like an Indian, without turning his toes out, but planking them down straight ahead. It was the fashion in those days to wear a fan-tailed coat, with a small collar, and buttons far apart behind, and few on the breast. Mr. Randolph's were the reverse of all this, and, instead of his coat being fan-tailed, it was what, we believe, the knight's of the needle call swallow-tailed; the collar was immensely large, the buttons behind were in kissing proximity, and they sat together as close on the breast of the garment as the feasters at a crowded public festival. His waist was remarkably slender; so slender that, as he stood with his arms akimbo, he could easily, as I thought, with his long bony fingers have spanned it. Around him his coat, which was very tight, was held together by one button, and, in consequence, an inch or more of tape, to which it was attached, was perceptible where it was pulled through the cloth. About his neck he wore a large white cravat, in which his chin was occasionally buried as he moved his head in conversation; no shirt collar was perceptible; every other person seemed to pride himself upon the size of his, as they were then worn large. Mr. Randolph's complexion was precisely that of a mummy, withered, saffron, dry and bloodless; you could not have placed a pin's point on his face where you would not have touched a wrinkle. His lips were thin, compressed, and colorless; the chin, beardless as a boy's, was broad for the size of his face, which was small; his nose was straight, with nothing remarkable in it, except perhaps it was too short. He wore a fur cap, which he took off, standing a few moments uncovered. I observed that his head was quite small, a characteristic which is said to have marked many men of talent, Byron, and Chief Justice Marshall, for instance. Judge Burnet, of Cincinnati, who has been alike distinguished at the bar, on the bench and in the United States Senate, and whom I have heard no less a judge and possessor of talent than Mr. Hammond, of the Gazette, say, was the clearest and most impressive speaker he ever heard, has also a very small head. Mr. Randolph's hair was remarkably fine— fine as an infant's, and thin. It was very long, and was parted with great care on the top of his head, and was tied behind with a bit of black riband about three inches from his neck; the whole of it formed a queue not thicker than the little finger of a delicate girl. His forehead was low, with no bumpology about it; but his eye, though sunken, was most brilliant and startling in its glance. It was not an eye of profound, but of impulsive and passionate thought, with an expression at times such as physicians describe to be that of insanity, but an insanity which seemed to quicken, not destroy, intellectual acuteness. I never beheld an eye that struck me more. It possessed a species of fascination, such as would make you wonder over the character of its possessor, without finding any clue in your wonderment to discover it, except that he was passionate, wayward, and fearless. He lifted his long bony finger impressively as he conversed, and gesticulated with it in a peculiar manner. His whole appearance struck me, and I could easily imagine how, with his great command of language, so appropriate and full, so brilliant and classical, joined to the vast information that his discursive oratory enabled him to exhibit in its fullest extent, from the storehouse of which the vividness of his imagination was always pointing out a happy analogy, or bitter sarcasm, that startled the more from the fact that his hearers did not perceive it until the look, tone, and finger brought it down with the suddenness of lightning, and with its effects, upon the head of his adversary; taking all this into consideration, I could easily imagine how, when almost a boy, he won so much fame, and preserved it so long and with so vast an influence, notwithstanding the eccentricity and inconsistency of his life, public and private. By the bye, the sudden, unexpected, and aphoristical way in which Randolph often expressed his sentiments had much to do with his oratorical success. He would, like Dean Swift, make a remark, seemingly a compliment, and explain it into a sarcasm, or he would utter an apparent sarcasm, and turn it into a compliment. Many speakers, when they have said a thing, hurry on to a full explanation, fearful that the hearer may not understand them; but when Randolph expressed one of these startling thoughts, he left the hearer for some time puzzling in doubt as to what he meant, and when it pleased him, in the coolest manner in the world he explained his meaning, not a little delighted if he discovered that his audience were wondering the while upon whom the blow would descend, or what principle the remark would be brought to illustrate. A little anecdote, which I heard a member of Congress, from Kentucky, tell of him, shows this characteristic. The Congressman, on his first visit to Washington, (he had just been elected,) was of course desirous of seeing the lions. Randolph, though not a member of either house, was there, and had himself daily borne into the Senate or House by his faithful Juba, to listen to the debates. Every body, noted or unnoted, were calling on the eccentric orator, and the member from Kentucky determined to do likewise, and gratify his curiosity. A friend, General —, promised to present him, saying though: “You must be prepared for an odd reception, for, if Randolph is in a bad humor, he will do and say any thing; if he is in a good humor, you will see a most finished gentleman.” They called. Mr. Randolph was stretched out on a sofa. “He seemed,” said the member, “a skeleton, endowed with those flashing eyes which ghost stories give to the re-animated body when sent upon some earthly mission.” The Congressman was presented by his friend, the General, as a member of Congress from Kentucky. “Ah, from Kentucky, sir,” exclaimed Randolph, in his shrill voice, as he rose to receive him, “from Kentucky, sir; well, sir, I consider your State the Botany Bay of Virginia.” The Kentuckian thought that the next remark would be a quotation from Barrington's Botany Bay epilogue, applied by Randolph to the Virginia settlers of Kentucky, “True patriots we, for be it understood, We left our country for our country's good,” but Randolph, after a pause, continued: “I do not make this remark, sir, in application to the morals or mode of settlement of Kentucky, No, sir, I mean to say that it is my opinion, sir, that the time approaches when Botany Bay will in all respects surpass England, and I fear it will soon be so with regard to your State and mine.” I cite this little anecdote not for any peculiar pith that it possesses, but in illustration of his character, and in proof of the remark above made. If Mr. Randolph had lived in ancient times, Plutarch, with all his powers in tracing the analogies of character, would have looked in vain for his parallel. And a modern biographer, with all ancient and all modern times before him, will find the effort fruitless that seeks his fellow. At first, the reader might think of Diogenes as furnishing some resemblance to him, and that all that Randolph wanted was a tub; but not so if another Alexander had asked him what he would have that imperial power could bestow—the answer never would have been a request to stand out of his sunlight. No, Randolph, if he could have got no higher emolument and honor, would immediately have requested to be sent on a foreign mission; that over, if Alexander had nothing more to give, and was so situated as not to be feared, who does not believe that the ex-minister would turn tail on him. The fact is, that Randolph was excessively ambitious, a cormorant alike for praise and plunder; and though his patriotism could point out the disinterested course to others, his love of money would not let him keep the track himself—at least in his latter years, when Mammon, the old man's God, beset him, and he turned an idolator to that for which he had so often expressed his detestation that his countrymen believed him. His mission to Russia broke the charm that the prevailing opinion of his disinterestedness cast about him, and his influence in his native State was falling fast beneath the appointment and outfit and salary that had disenchanted it when he died; and now old Virginia will forget and forgive these inconsistencies of one of her greatest sons to do reverence to his memory. Randolph's republicanism was never heartfelt; he was at heart an aristocrat. He should have been born in England a noble— there he would stubbornly have resisted the encroachments of all below him upon his own prerogatives, station, dignity, and quality; and he would have done his best to have brought the prerogatives, station, dignity, and quality of all above him a little below his level, or at least upon an equality with his. Randolph would have lifted Wilkes up to be a thorn in the side of a king whom he did not like, and to overthrow his minister; had he been himself a minister, his loyalty would then have pronounced Wilkes an unprincipled demagogue. Wilkes, we know, when he got office, said he could prove to his majesty that he himself had never been a Wilkeite. Randolph was intensely selfish, and his early success as a politician and orator impressed him with an exaggerated opinion of his own importance, at an age when such opinions are easily made and not easily eradicated. In the case of Randolph this overweaning self-estimation grew monstrous. “Big man me, John,” and the bigness or littleness of others' services were valued and proclaimed just in proportion as they elevated or depressed the interests and personal dignity of the orator of Roanoke. And often when his interest had nothing to do with the question presented to him, his caprice would sway his judgment, for his personal resentments led him far away from every consideration save that of how he could best wound his adversary. His blow wanted neither vigor nor venom; his weapons were poisoned with such consummate skill, and he so well knew the vulnerable point of every character, that often when the wound by an observer who knew nothing of his opponent was deemed slight, it was rankling in the heart. Randolph was well acquainted with the private history of the eminent men of his time, the peccadilloes, frailties, indiscretions, weaknesses, vanities, and vices of them all. He used his tongue as a jockey would his whip; he hit the sore place till the blood came, and there was no crack or flourish, or noise, or bluster in doing it. It was done with a celerity and dexterity which showed the practised hand, and its unexpectedness as well as its severity often dumbfounded the victim so completely that he had not one word to say, but writhed in silence. I remember hearing two anecdotes of Randolph, which strikingly type his character. One exhibits his cynical rudeness and disregard for the feelings of others—in fact a wish to wound their feelings—and the other his wit. I do not vouch for their accuracy, but I give them as I have frequently heard them, as perhaps has the reader. Once, when Randolph was in the city of B—, he was in the daily habit of frequenting the bookstore of one of the largest booksellers in the place. He made some purchases from him, and was very curious in looking over his books, &amp;c. In the course of Randolph's visits, he became very familiar with Mr. —, the bookseller, and they held long chats together; the orator of Roanoke showing off with great courtesy. Mr. — was quite a pompous man, and rather vain of his acquaintance with the lions who used to stop in his shop. Subsequently, being in Washington with a friend, he espied Randolph advancing towards him, and told his friend that he would introduce him to the “great man.” His friend, however, knowing the waywardness of Randolph, declined. “Well,” said Mr. —, “I am sorry you will not be introduced—I'll go up and give him a shake of the hand at any rate.” Up he walked, with outstretched hand, to salute the cynic. The aristocratic Republican (by the bye, how often your thoroughgoing Republican is a full-blooded aristocrat in his private relations) immediately threw his hand behind him, as if he could not “dull his palm” in that way, and gazed searchingly into the face of the astonished bookseller. “Oh, oh!” said he, as if recollecting himself, “you are Mr. B—, from Baltimore?” “Yes, sir,” was the reply. “A bookseller?” “Yes, sir,” again. “Ah! I bought some books from you?” “Yes, sir, you did.” “Did I forget to pay you for them?” “No, sir, you did not.” “Good morning, sir,” said the orator, lifting his cap with offended dignity, and passing on. This anecdote does not show either Randolph's goodness of head or heart, but it shows his character. The other anecdote is as follows. The Honorable Peter —, who was a watchmaker, and who had represented B— county for many years in Congress, once made a motion to amend a resolution offered by Randolph, on the subject of military claims. Mr. Randolph rose up after the amendment had been offered, and drawing his watch from his fob, asked the Honorable Peter what o'clock it was. He told him. “Sir,” replied the orator, “you can mend my watch, but not my motions. You understand tictics, sir, but not tactics!” That, too, was a fine retort, when, after he had been speaking, several members rose in succession and attacked him. “Sir,” said he to the Speaker, “I am in the condition of old Lear— `The little dogs and all, Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart, See—they bark at me.”' All accounts agree in praising the oratorical powers of Randolph. His manner was generally slow and impressive, his voice squeaking, but clear and distinct, and, as far as it could be heard, what he said was clearly understood. His gesture was chiefly with his long and skeleton-like finger. The impressiveness with which he used it has been remarked by all who have heard him. When he was sarcastic, amidst a thousand it would say, stronger than language, to the individual whom he meant, “Thou art the man.” In his choice of language he was very fastidious, making sometimes a considerable pause to select a word. His reading was extensive, and in every department of knowledge—romances, tales, poems, plays, voyages, travels, history, biography, philosophy—all arrested his attention, and each had detained him long enough to render him familiar with the best works of the kind. His mind was naturally erratic, and his desultory reading, as he never devoted himself to profession, and dipped a little into all, increased his natural and mental waywardness. He seldom reasoned, and when he did, it was with an effort that was painful, and which cost him more trouble than it was worth. He said himself, in one of his speeches in the Senate of the United States, “that he had a defect, whether of education or nature was immaterial, perhaps proceeding from both—a defect which had disabled him, from his first entrance into public life to the present hour, from making what is called a regular speech.” The defect was doubtless both from education 8 and nature; education might have, in some measure, corrected the tendencies of his nature, but there was perhaps an idiosyncrasy in the constitution of the man, which compelled him to be meteoric and erratic in mind as well as temper. He said that “ridicule was the keenest weapon in the whole parliamentary armory,” and he learned all the tricks of fence with it, and never played with foils. He seems to have had more admiration for the oratory of Chatham than that of any other individual, if we may judge from the manner in which that great man is mentioned in his speeches. They were certainly unlike in character, very unlike. Chatham having had bad health, and it being well known that he went to Parliament and made his best efforts when almost sinking from sickness, Randolph might have felt that, as he had done the same thing, their characters were assimilated. Chatham was seized with a fainting fit when making his last speech, and died a short time afterwards. And probably it is not idle speculation to say that Randolph, with a morbid or perhaps an insane admiration of his character, wished to sink as Chatham did, in the legislative hall, and be borne thence to die. However, there was enough in the character of Chatham to win the admiration of any one who loved eloquence, without seeking in adventitious circumstances a motive for his admiration; and Randolph appreciated such talents as his too highly not to have admired them under all circumstances, but his reverence was doubtless increased from the resemblance which he saw in their bodily conditions, and which, he was very willing to believe, extended to their minds. Chatham was bold, vehement, resistless, not often witty, but eminently successful when he attempted it; invective was his forte. In some of these points Randolph resembled him; but then Chatham's eloquence was but a means to gain his ends; his judgment was intuitive, his sagacity unrivalled; he bore down all opposition by his fearless energies, and he compelled his enemies to admit that he was a public benefactor in the very breath in which they expressed their personal dislike. Chatham kept his ends steadily in view, and never wavered in his efforts to gain them. Not so Randolph. He reminds us of the urchin in the “Lay of the Last Minstrel,” who always used his fairy gifts with a spirit of deviltry to provoke, to annoy, and to injure, no matter whom he wounded, or when or where. Randolph did not want personal dignity, but he wanted the dignity which arises from consistent conduct, a want which no brilliancy of talent can supply. On the contrary, the splendor of high talents but serve to make such inconsistency the more apparent. He was an intellectual meteor, whose course no one could predict; but, be it where it might, all were certain that it would blaze, and wither, and destroy. As a statesman, it is believed that he never originated a single measure, though his influence often destroyed the measures of others. Some one observes “that the hand which is not able to build a hovel, may destroy a palace,” and he seemed to have had a good deal of the ambition of him who fired the Ephesian dome. As a scholar, he left nothing behind him, though his wit was various and his acquirements profound. He seems not to have written a common communication for a newspaper, without great labor and fastidious correction. I have been informed by a compositor who set a part of his speech on “retrenchment,” which he dedicated to his constituents, that his amendations were endless. I have a part of the MS. of this speech before me; it is written with a trembling hand, but with great attention to punctuation, and with a delicate stroke of the pen. It was as an orator he shone; and, as an orator, his power of chaining the attention of his audience has been, perhaps, never surpassed. In an assembly where Demosthenes, Cicero, Chatham, Mirabeau, or Henry spoke, Randolph's eloquence would have been listened to with profound interest, and his opposition would have been feared. As an orator he felt his power—he knew that in eloquence he wielded a magic wand, and he was not only fearless of opposition, but he courted it; for who of his contemporaries has equalled him in the power of carrying on successfully the partisan warfare of desultory debate— the cut and thrust—the steady aim? Who could wield like him the tomahawk, and who of them possessed his dexterity in scalping a foe? His trophies are numberless, and he wore them with the pride of his progenitors, for there was truly a good deal of Indian blood in his veins. It is said that Randolph first signalized himself by making a stump speech in Virginia in opposition to Patrick Henry. Scarcely any one knew him when he rose to reply to Henry, and so strong was Henry's conviction of his powers, that he spoke of them in the highest terms, and prophesied his future eminence. Randolph gloriously said of Henry that “he was Shakspeare and Garrick combined.” Randolph's character and conduct forcibly impress upon us the power of eloquence in a republic. How many twists, and turns, and tergiversations, and obliquities were there in his course; yet how much influence he possessed, particularly in Virginia! How much he was feared, courted, admired, shunned, hated, and all because he wielded the weapon that “rules the fierce democracy!” How many men, far his superiors in practical usefulness, lived unhonored and without influence, and died unsung, because they had not eloquence. Eloquence is superior to all other gifts, even to the dazzling fascinations of the warrior; for it rules alike in war and peace, and it wins all by its spell. Randolph was the very personification of inconsistency. Behold him talking of the “splendid misery” of officeholders; “what did he want with office; a cup of cold water was better in his condition; the sword of Damocles was suspended over him by a single hair,” &amp;c. &amp;c.—when lo! he goes to the frigid north—for what? For health? No, for an outfit and a salary! and dies childless, worth, it is said, nearly a million! Randolph's oratory reminds us forcibly of Don Juan; and if Byron had written nothing but Don Juan, Randolph might have been called the Byron of orators. He had all the wit, eccentricity, malice, and flightiness of that work—its touches that strike the heart, and sarcasms that scorn, the next moment, the tear that had started. In a dying state Randolph went to Washington during the last session of Congress, and, although not a member, he had himself borne daily to the hall of legislation to witness the debate. He returned home to his constituents and was elected to Congress, and started on a tour to Europe, if possible to regain his health; he said “it was the last throw of the die.” He expired in Philadelphia, where he had first appeared in the councils of the nation, in the sixty-first year of his age, leaving a reputation behind him for classic wit and splendid eloquence which few of his contemporaries may hope to equal; and a character which his biographer may deem himself fortunate if he can explain it to have been compatible with either the duties of social life, the sacredness of friendship, or the requirements of patriotism unless he offer as an apology partial derangement. In the letter in which the deceased acknowledged that he had made a misstatement in regard to the character of Mr. Lowndes on the tariff, he assigned, as a reason of the error, the disordered state of his mind, arising from the exciting medicine which he was compelled to take to sustain life. I have, perhaps, expressed myself harshly, inconsistent with that charitable feeling which all should possess who are “treading upon ashes under which the fire is not yet extinguished.” If so to express our conscientious opinions is sometimes to do wrong, “Why draw his frailties from their dread abode?” For who can tell, in the close alliance between reason and madness which were so strongly mixed up in his character, how much his actions and words partook of the one or the other? Where they alternated, or where one predominated, or where they mingled their influence, not in the embrace of love, but in the strife for mastery, oh! how much he may have struggled with his mental aberrations and wanderings, and felt that they were errors, and yet struggled in vain. His spirit, like the great eye of the Universe, may have known that clouds and storms beset it, and have felt that it was contending with disease and the film of coming death, yet hoped at last to beam forth in its brightness. “The day drags on, though storms keep out the sun, And thus the heart will break, and brokenly live on.” And so is it with the mind, and Randolph's “brokenly lived on” till the raven shadows of the night of death gathered over him and gave him to the dark beyond.
